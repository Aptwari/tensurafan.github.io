<p class="credits-entry" id="line_15">Volume 8 is finally done, kept you waiting huh?</p>
<p class="credits-entry-space" id="line_16">There’re not many major note-worthy things in this volume, most of such will be annotated in the book. These include lines and phrases I’m not entirely sure of or explanation of phrase/term origin etc.</p>
<p class="credits-entry" id="line_17">I’ve tried to proofread the volume as much as possible with the JP source this time, though it would be good to have a JP proofreader separately. Again, special thanks to Mimisan for his contribution in Volume 7 and 8 with the Japanese proofread.</p>
<p class="credits-entry" id="line_18">There’s one particular issue however I wish to address at the front, that is the issue with websites sharing our work. Since our work is totally free and available to anyone online, obviously there will be websites sharing our work, if you are not using them for any commercial means, we appreciate the sharing. However, I’ve come to notice some websites have published our work with edits of their own, whether it is a watermark of their own, changing the paragraph format or in some worse cases removing annotations.</p>

<p class="no-indent" id="line_32">“Talk about being mischievous, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. You almost got me killed out there.”</p>
<p id="line_33">“Surely you jest. Didn’t you already flee before getting affected at all?”</p>
<p id="line_34">“Can that really be helped? Have you not received the report from my subordinate?”</p>
<p id="line_35">“I guess I did—”</p>
<p id="line_36">“That <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> beyond my imagination. It won’t matter even if the Empire sends out their regular army. And judging from my knowledge, there wouldn’t be a chance to win without using the Emperor’s Royal Guard. By the way—”</p>
<p id="line_37">Damrada and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> exchanged these lines. Sitting on chairs opposite each other, the two casually tried to pry into each other’s minds.</p>
<p id="line_38">Damrada, noticing that the battle plan had failed, decided to distance himself from the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> family until the tide settled. Negotiation could have been more favorable for him had the plan been a success. Yet now that it had failed, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> may deliberately use this as an excuse to place obstacles before him. That’s why Damrada wanted to bail out and start over.</p>
<p id="line_39">However, the situation had changed. When Damrada was on his way to Tempest Federation, someone reported to him through ‘Magic Communication.’</p>
<p id="line_40">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was defeated. And she seemed to have made peace with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_41">Among the many outcomes he had predicted, this was the worst possible scenario. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was still alive and the Western Nations were still under the influence of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It would be far more difficult to do business there now. Moreover, since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had made peace with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it would be challenging to instigate <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> into trying to kill her again. Damrada only initiated the plan because his interests aligned with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s, yet at that moment he could conclude that the plan had completely failed.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_42"><em>But considering this from another perspective, it may be beneficial.</em></p>
<p id="line_43">Although the plan had failed, it didn’t cause any grave loss to Damrada. While he may have lost a venue for business in the Western Nations, there were still other channels for making profits. Cerberus was a huge underground organization and had several trade unions as its cover.</p>
<p id="line_44">Besides, Damrada had no interest in whether <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> lived or not. That’s why he wasn’t that angry at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s miscalculation. His goal here, in fact, was to exploit the outcome to secure a favorable position for himself in future negotiations.</p>
<p id="line_45">Coming to that conclusion, Damrada changed his plan on the spot and decided to drop by to greet <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_46">“—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s plan did sound a lot better in theory. While failing to take care of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is one thing, allowing her to build a friendly relationship with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is another issue altogether…” Damrada reasoned, avoiding taking responsibility and shifting the blame upon <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s group.</p>
<p id="line_47">However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had seen this coming.</p>
<p id="line_48">“Right, I can’t deny that,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> unapologetically agreed with Damrada’s accusation, and continued to point out his perceptions of the situation. “This upset in the balance of power can’t be reversed at this point in time. The great historic kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> will eventually fall, and a new kingdom will be built on its ruins. It will be all according to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s wishes, also meaning that your plan is a goner.”</p>
<p id="line_49">Damrada’s silence was his response, agreeing with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s views.</p>
<p id="line_50">“What do you plan to do next then?”</p>
<p id="line_51">“In regard to what exactly?”</p>
<p id="line_52">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s goal seems to be to turn the Jura Great Forest into an economic hub. It is something that us <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> will not permit.”</p>
<p id="line_53">“Mmm-hmm…”</p>
<p id="line_54">Damrada began to consider <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words as he finished. He wasn’t planning on being hostile with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> either. It was in their mutual interest to let go of any resentment between them.</p>
<p id="line_55"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was of the same mind. Moreover, he seemed to be looking farther into the future than Damrada.</p>
<p id="line_56">“Do we stand to gain anything with this in-fighting? Right now, we simply don’t have the strength to make a blatant move against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> the Saint. Don’t you agree?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> continued, seemingly seeing through Damrada’s thoughts.</p>
<p id="line_57">“Hehehe. I’ve been totally bested, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. Yes indeed, there’s no value in arguing as to who is to blame. We will continue our friendly relationship with the gentlemen of the Five Elders as always. Here’s where I stand—though it may be true that we didn’t profit from the war, that’s a whole different story. As long as we live, we are left with opportunities.”</p>
<p id="line_58">“As expected of Damrada-dono; it’s great that you are so reasonable. Then let’s unite to prevent the emergence of a new trade bloc on that land.”</p>
<p id="line_59">There was no need for further explanation of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s intent. He was trying to safeguard the power he wielded in the Western Nations. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s trump card, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, had foreseen the birth of a new trade bloc centered around the Jura Great Forest. If left undealt, the influence of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would no doubt be diminished.</p>
<p id="line_60">How could <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> allow such a flaw after spending more than a thousand years building up this system of domination? For this reason, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> planned to crush this flaw by interfering with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Right now, he was no longer part of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Seven Luminary Clerics" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and could no longer act under the name of the God <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That’s why, no matter what, he would require the aid of the organization Damrada’s party belonged to—Cerberus.</p>
<p id="line_61"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s kin—the five other elders from his family—also supported this proposal. They each secretly influenced the Western State Council to prolong the aftermath of the civil unrest in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_62">There were some other “Aces” that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> have hidden, but it was still too early to show their hand yet. With that being the case, it was only wise to properly make use of Cerberus.</p>
<p id="line_63">This was the ideal plan on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s mind.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_64">However—</p>
<p id="line_65">“Well, hold on just one sec.”</p>
<p id="line_66">Damrada didn’t intend to follow through with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s proposal. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the Five Elders leading them—these people were amazing business partners—he’d be lying if he claimed to not want to maintain a tie with them. But they were gravely mistaken if they thought that Damrada would listen to everything they said.</p>
<p id="line_67">Damrada was a businessman after all. He got paid to do things, and his thoughts were ever-changing. There were trade blocs in both the East and the West. Cerberus was able to accumulate great wealth by getting hold of these trade routes, so it was more beneficial for Cerberus to have as many different trading partners as they could. Thus, it wouldn’t matter to Damrada even if the influence of the Five Elders dropped in the Western Nations.</p>
<p id="line_68">“—I speak from my heart when I say that I hope we remain on good terms in the future,” Damrada said, looking <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the eye. “But I can’t help but disagree with what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama just said.

<p id="line_69">“Damn brat…”</p>
<p id="line_70">“Hehehe, this is but my respectful response to your proposal. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had already found me to be suspicious, so it won’t be that simple to continue our activities in the Western Nations. I will have to return to my homeland and send a replacement for myself.”</p>
<p id="line_71"><em>Had you eliminated <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as promised, I wouldn’t be tied up like this</em>—while insulting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with this implication, Damrada also refused to comply with his demand.</p>
<p id="line_72">“…”</p>
<p id="line_73">“We’ll continue the part of our business in trade as usual. But let us just pretend like all of this never happened.”</p>
<p id="line_74">Leaving these words, Damrada rose up from his seat. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, having missed the mark with his proposal, couldn’t simply argue back at Damrada anymore. The organization known as Cerberus was way too powerful in the underworld of the Eastern Empire. Angering any one of its leaders, such as Damrada, would lead to a splinter in their relationship. It would be too huge a loss for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> at that point in time.</p>
<p id="line_75">“…It can’t be helped. Then leave this matter to us. Just don’t hold us back.”</p>
<p id="line_76">“That’s for certain. Do put your trust in us considering our relation so far,” Damrada answered with a smile and departed after giving a polite bow.</p>
<p id="line_77">His sincere attitude made him appear as an honest merchant, but had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> been eliminated, he would’ve been long gone to go and garner <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s support. Then he would’ve simply weighed the benefits between the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and waited to profit. The fact that he was able to achieve this under everyone’s nose shows that Damrada of “Gold” was not just for show.</p>
<p id="line_78">Yet <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was also a cunning man who had accumulated his fair share of experience. He already understood half of Damrada’s intent. Their party was probably not going to hold the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> back, just as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> proposed, but he couldn’t know for sure whether Damrada would do business with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or not.</p>
<p id="line_79">But Damrada was rather upstanding as a merchant, for he did not lie.</p>
<p id="line_80">Though in the eyes of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the ruler and head of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Damrada’s attitude was unacceptable.</p>
<p id="line_81">“…How unpleasant. You dared to exploit our failure. We will take care of you all by the time this whole ordeal concludes,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s mutters echoed in the room after Damrada left. His eyes, dyed with the color of humiliation; A surge of furious flame emerged and gradually consumed his eyes…</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_82">“…And just like that, I made the deal with the Five Elders,” Damrada reported to the young man casually sitting on the chair.</p>
<p id="line_83">“Is that so? It’s great that our tie with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is finally settled as you expected. Now we can ensure a channel of communication with them in the future.”</p>
<p id="line_84">Although Damrada maintained an arrogant composure when negotiating with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he appeared rather humble in front of the young man. But that was only natural, for this young man was Damrada’s boss, and commander in chief of the secret organization Cerberus. The young man nodded leisurely after hearing Damrada’s reports.</p>
<p id="line_85">“I see. Having said that, those bastards are the type to force the quest to take on that type of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on me without even providing any information…”</p>
<p id="line_86">“Ahaha, I guess our luck is down. But it is probably the most fortunate in this whole unlucky ordeal that you were able to retreat in time.”</p>
<p id="line_87">“Hehehe, indeed. How lucky. Was he called <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or something? He could rival that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> White (Blanc) that rampages in the Empire—such a terrifying <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_88">“I suppose you can put it that way… The speed at which <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seems to accumulate strength is much faster than our own reorganization…”</p>
<p id="line_89">“Indeed.

Not only did he gather a group of powerful <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s under his reign, he even tamed that ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Storm Dragon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’—”</p>
<p id="line_90">“Honestly, it would be the worst option to confront that kind of power head-on.”</p>
<p id="line_91">“No chance of winning—although I wouldn’t go so far as to call him unbeatable. Cerberus would definitely collapse if we came into conflict.”</p>
<p id="line_92">“Regardless, there is no use in rushing. Since there’s still time, we should take our time to think about it.”</p>
<p id="line_93">“That should be pretty appropriate. This chaotic situation may last for quite a while, and we may suffer some losses from striking under such circumstances.”</p>
<p id="line_94">“You have a point. I tried to intimidate them by using <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>… But that strategy has failed as well. It is best that we stay quiet for a while before we dig ourselves into a deeper hole,” the young man commented jokingly and agreed to Damrada’s opinion, sharing his own thoughts. Suddenly, Damrada seemed to have recalled something and began to complain.</p>
<p id="line_95">“By the way, the Five Elders sure brag a lot. They promised to eliminate <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> the Saint and look how <em>that</em> ended up.

To that, the young man replied with a wry smile.</p>
<p id="line_96">“That’s within my expectations as well. I suspected that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be too naive and wouldn’t want to kill <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. If things had gone smoothly, that naivety would have destroyed him. I was even looking forward to it…but it appears that he’s not as naive as I thought.”</p>
<p id="line_97">“The Five Elders seemed to plan to suppress the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Storm Dragon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ and it appears that they intended to collaborate with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_98">“We wouldn’t be in such a bind had things gone that smoothly. I ordered careful surveillance expecting this failure.”</p>
<p id="line_99">“I see, so that’s the case. But speaking of which, I was saved thanks to it. If you didn’t contact me then, I would have run into <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> the Saint before she went to find <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_100">They could have kept their identity a secret if lucky, but it was simply wishful thinking, considering that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was their opponent. That’s why Damrada was very grateful towards the young man who sensed the danger and informed him beforehand. With that being said, there would be no danger of being exposed had the young man not tasked Damrada with lying to her in the first place.</p>
<p id="line_101">But such matters were trivial to Damrada. As the commander in chief of Cerberus, the young man’s orders took priority over anything else. After all, the young man who formed the secret organization Cerberus aimed to dominate. He wished to conquer the entire world. Damrada resonated with his ambition and greatly admired him. Even though he would laugh such a notion off under normal circumstances, Damrada had a hunch that the young man can make this a reality. That’s why he didn’t doubt the young man’s order.</p>
<p id="line_102">The young man responded to Damrada frankly: “My plans would have been wasted had I lost you as well.”</p>
<p id="line_103">“Well, I’ll at least try to figure out a way to escape if I really run into a life or death situation like that,” Damrada replied with a proud smile after seeing the young man’s concern for him.</p>
<p id="line_104">“One can’t just become a leader of ‘Cerberus’ with money alone. They must also have tenacious strength, enough to at least back themselves up in order to convince the many powerful men in the underworld.”</p>
<p id="line_105">The young man also seemed to know that, so he replied with a mocking grin, “Ahaha, but seriously, don’t go all out yet. It should be the last resort anyway. Right now, let’s just enjoy observing this wrestling game from afar without brute force.”</p>
<p id="line_106">Going all out—in other words, if Cerberus were to give everything they had, it would require the presence of the other two leaders. When that happens, it would no longer just be gentle manipulations in the background, instead it would likely lead to the outbreak of a great war involving all of the Western Nations.</p>
<p id="line_107">As the commander in chief, the young man didn’t want things to develop like that. Damrada was quite aware of it as well, so he answered without hesitation.</p>
<p id="line_108">“Then it is perhaps best for me to return to my motherland first.”</p>
<p id="line_109">“Right, that would be even better. Even though you weren’t spotted by anyone, it’s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> we’re talking about here. She probably already has her eyes on you. It will be more difficult for you to act in public, so it would be best for you to find yourself a replacement. With that being said—”</p>
<p id="line_110">Damrada already knew what the young man was going to say. The issue was concerning one of the other two leaders of Cerberus who shared a status similar to Damrada.</p>
<p id="line_111">“Don’t get Vega here.”</p>
<p id="line_112">That’s why he could understand why the young man would make such an order.</p>
<p id="line_113">“Understood. Then I shall ask <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Misha" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to replace me.”</p>
<p id="line_114">“Good, go do just that.”</p>
<p id="line_115">The bosses were nicknamed the Gold, the Lover, and the Power, the three symbols of a man’s greed. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Misha" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the Lover, was someone you never wanted to let your guard down around, but she at least listened to reason. Vega, the Power, was a handful. He was a living, breathing personification of violence, as his name suggested. Damrada could do nothing to sway his mind; he only listened to direct orders from the boy, who knew that well enough and didn’t want Damrada to deal with him.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_163">He said it without a hint of remorse, but it didn’t necessarily mean Louis was completely apathetic.

<p id="line_183">Arnaud and Renard spoke from the same mind as both dismissed my concerns.

<p id="line_184">“That’s fine then.”</p>
<p id="line_185">Seeing that I was on the same page, Arnaud added: “Moreover, after seeing such a sight…”</p>
<p id="line_186">Although he was vague, I was able to guess as to what Arnaud was referring to. That sight he mentioned must be referring to the fact that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Veldora were engaging in a fierce battle just above our heads.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_187"><em>Honestly, you two are giving me a headache, so please stop immediately</em>.</p>
<p id="line_188">I had established a defensive network with ‘Absolute Defense’ from ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Covenant King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Uriel’ in order to prevent people on the ground from being affected. But the area was simply too wide; there was still a chance for casualties.</p>
<p id="line_189">It wasn’t hard to imagine the reason behind Arnaud’s quivering voice after witnessing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s intense and cruel attacks.</p>
<p id="line_190">As in: “It’s no wonder that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama was defeated against an opponent as strong as that.”</p>
<p id="line_191">“She’s indeed worthy of the title of God. If she were to become an enemy of humanity, we probably wouldn’t be able to do anything…”</p>
<p id="line_192">Compared to the conversations we had, this sight alone seemed to be far more convincing to the members of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight Order" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It was then that Louis addressed them, “Rest assured. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama has a generous heart; her grace doesn’t take joy in abusing people under her protection. As long as humans refrain from antagonizing her, a friendly relationship can surely be built. But she would indeed forbid anyone from revealing her true identity.”</p>
<p id="line_193"><em>Don’t spread news that says the God <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,</em> Louis urged them firmly.</p>
<p id="line_194">Indeed, it was all because of Veldora that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s identity got exposed. I would naturally do them this favor as well. While I was willing to help, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s…they seemed to also be willing to keep this information a secret. The reason was probably due to the fact that it was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s wish as well. It seemed that their admiration of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had far exceeded my expectations.</p>
<p id="line_195">Now then, I guess there doesn’t seem to be a need to worry.

<p id="line_196">“Hey you, are you thinking about something rude again?”</p>
<p id="line_197">“EHH! N-no, I’m not thinking of anything—”</p>
<p id="line_198">Could this girl actually have some sort of superpower? She read my mind like a book…</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_199">«Negative. No such effect is detected.»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_200">I-is that so?</p>
<p id="line_201">Then, her instinct is truly terrifying.

<p class="space-break" id="line_202">Suddenly, a flying object hurtled towards the ground, striking a giant crater. That thing got up casually and ran towards me as soon as it saw me. That was of course Veldora. He snuck behind my back, staring up into the sky while using me as his shield.

<p class="space-break" id="line_204"><em>Uhhhhh, okie. But seriously, please leave me out of this.</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_205">It was all Veldora’s fault this time after all. But, come to think of it, when did Veldora ever do any good?

<p id="line_208">“Hand over the lizard.”</p>
<p id="line_209">The oppressive tone of her voice sent shivers down my spine. Her glare also terrified Veldora who was hiding behind my back.

Besides, I could relate to her feelings. That was not an apology at all. I think it’s about time for Veldora to get some punishment and reflect for a bit one way or another.</p>
<p id="line_210">That’s why I—</p>
<p id="line_211">“Here you go.”</p>
<p id="line_212">I grabbed Veldora’s neck and without hesitation pushed him over to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

<p id="line_250">I shook my head in an attempt to dispel such thoughts and get back in the right frame of mind. I took a glance around and announced: “We should change the venue next. There have been a lot of misunderstandings, so let’s settle down for now and discuss our future relations in detail.”</p>
<p id="line_251">And so, I decide to lead the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s into our town.</p>

He may have learnt some new tricks from all the diplomacy lately, but that smile on his face would not lose to any professional attendant. He didn’t display a single trace of hostility towards these individuals who we were just on guard against, how skillful!</p>
<p id="line_258">“We will be preparing meals, so do tell if you have any dietary restrictions.”</p>
<p id="line_259">He had also carefully considered people that may have dietary constraints due to allergies or religion. His diligence in studying was truly admirable. He must have learnt about the human culture or mindset during his encounters with adventurers and merchants while I wasn’t looking.</p>
<p id="line_260">No one would probably believe that he was originally just some weak goblin.</p>
<p id="line_261">“Ah, no. You don’t have to be so courteous—”</p>

Before we knew it, however, night descended upon us, so we may have to move meetings to the next day. Since such an opportunity was rare, I might as well show these guests around town while they were here.</p>
<p id="line_263">“Ah, don’t be so generous. Let’s leave the detailed discussion for tomorrow. Today we should hold a feast in celebration of our peaceful resolution and have some fun!”</p>

<p id="line_266">“Hmm. If you are hosting a feast, surely you would want to invite me as well, wouldn’t you?”</p>
<p id="line_267">HMM-HUH!</p>

<p id="line_269">“Of course we will! Should I call you <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>…-dono?”</p>

I thought she would be the arrogant type, but it turned out that she had quite the forthright personality. Now we could live in peace. Yet Veldora suddenly started to complain again, which in effect, caused <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to…</p>

<p id="line_277">“GAHAHAHA! Interesting. I’ll show you my power after evolution then—”</p>
<p id="line_278">The two started to fight (again). Should I call them incompatible?</p>
<p id="line_279">You really couldn’t tell without seeing them get in a fight with each other. But if I continued to allow the two to act so recklessly, this entire town may end up destroyed.</p>
<p id="line_280">“Idiot! You stop that right now! No fighting is allowed here.”</p>
<p id="line_281">Having realized this, I invoked my authority to mediate the fight.</p>

<p id="line_283">She seemed to finally be done, so let’s refrain from further agitating her. If she were going to participate in our feast, I would have to treat her with the highest courtesy.</p>

<p id="line_286">“I didn’t attend the feast last time because I had an ominous feeling, but that alone shouldn’t be a problem preventing me from going.

His elderly character was only limited to his appearance. His back was ramrod straight, and one could tell he was no ordinary man from his aura alone. He was at least able to stand toe to toe with Louis.</p>
<p id="line_290"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> turned to the man with displeasure.</p>

<p id="line_294">“But—”</p>
<p id="line_295">“How stubborn!

<p id="line_298">“Hmm, thanks for the hard work, Gunther. I have Louis and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> here, so you are worrying too much.”</p>
<p id="line_299">“It is only natural for me to worry about your highness.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The address used by Gunther here is actually “Princess,” which may either be some foreshadowing or just a term Fuse decided to use." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>”</p>
<p id="line_300">Gunther turned to Louis.</p>
<p id="line_301">“Then I shall leave the rest to your care, Louis.”</p>
<p id="line_302">“Understood.”</p>
<p id="line_303">Louis seemed rather troubled as well.

Gunther vanished the moment he heard Louis’s response.</p>
<p id="line_304">Now that he had left, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s mood seemed to be gradually lightening as well.</p>
<p id="line_305">“All right, that annoying fella is gone. Now I can enjoy the feast all I want!”</p>
<p id="line_306">And so, likely coerced by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s imposing aura, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight Order" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was forced to join as well.</p>

After all, her duel with Veldora just now was terrifying. Even though I was able to stop them before it escalated, things would have gotten hairy had I left it unattended. Those wearing tense expressions seemed to be very aware of this, while some still seemed to be out of the loop with the whole ordeal. I’ll just leave things as they are.</p>
<p id="line_308">It was only natural for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s to feel confused after going through all of this. Moreover, my duel with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> before was also at a superhuman level.

<p id="line_309">Anyhow, I’ll let them relax for the day.</p>
<p id="line_310">Rigurd was straight to the point as he delivered the instructions with a resounding clap. With that, the citizens on hold quickly moved into action to assist the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. Some were in charge of tending to the horses, some were safekeeping the weapons and gear, and others were distributing healing potions to the injured.</p>
<p id="line_311">Now that I looked at these knights, their words about trusting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were no lie.

Some were even gasping at the effect of the medicine, most likely after trying them out.</p>
<p id="line_312">And here I thought there might be more quarrels, but things were surprisingly peaceful.</p>

They shouldn’t have been strangers to the term “bathing,” considering there was such a tradition in the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as well.

<p id="line_315">Hmph, be shocked indeed! I was very proud of this, after all, since the bathhouse in our nation was more luxurious than the royal bathhouse found in the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It was more like a hot spring resort since we had everything from a large bathing area to our famed outdoor bathing pool.

On one hand, we get to promote ourselves, and on the other, they also got to wash away their fatigue. Moreover, their clothes were torn and stained after the intense battles, so we would be preparing replacements. It was a rare opportunity, so let’s use it to advertise our nation. We had someone prepare the newly developed kimonos made from hemp. There were also yukatas for the ladies, so there were a lot of options.</p>
<p id="line_316">“Please leave that to us. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama is already working on it,” Haruna said, beaming.

<p id="line_317">“Then, I shall invite everyone to enjoy the proud hot springs of our nation. These are hot springs led directly from their source and can cleanse your fatigue. Moreover, it is superb for skin care.”</p>
<p id="line_318">I didn’t forget to do a little touting.

<p id="line_319">“Oh, did you say hot springs? And skincare? How interesting. And as for my personal bathhouse, surely it will be the classiest room in this kingdom?”</p>
<p id="line_320">Hmm? Personal bathhouse?</p>
<p id="line_321">Ah, I suddenly understood what she meant. The Dwarven Kingdom, Dwargon, which possessed advanced technology, mainly used individual saunas. There weren’t any bathhouses for multiple people to bathe in. There were public bathhouses in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but none in Blumund. Since the average denizens there would use ‘Utility Magic (Daily Magic)’ to purify themselves, there was little need for a water bath. There were also many people around major towns that could help with casting purification at a low price. In other words, water bathing was not common in this world, limited to only large nations with many otherworlders as residents. There, the upper echelons could enjoy luxurious, personal bathing pools.</p>
<p id="line_322">I almost forgot the fact that here in our nation, every household had an individual bathing pool. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> probably thought of them as some sort of private royal bath, which we happened to lack. If I lead <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to bathe in a pool of a regular civilian household, there was no guessing how furious she would get. For this reason, I decided to clarify the misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_323">“Ahh. We have bathhouses where everyone can bathe together, with the males and females separated of course. There is also a mixed bath if you so desire; I definitely won’t stop you…”</p>
<p id="line_324">I was trying to get the idea across to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> first before someone else gave an unexpected response.</p>
<p id="line_325">“—AHHH!”</p>
<p id="line_326">“W-What did you say?!” <s>(said Arnaud, unsurprisingly)</s></p>
<p id="line_327">“Oh uh…”</p>

Hehehe, they seem to be quite the men of culture as well.</p>
<p id="line_329">“Hmmph. If you guys are interested, just go ahead—”</p>
<p id="line_330">I was cut short midway when I noticed the icy cold glare <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was giving me.

<p class="space-break" id="line_333">I see, so it couldn’t be helped after all.

<p id="line_334">Arnaud and the rest looked quite frustrated, but successfully inviting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to a mixed bath was an impossible feat.</p>
<p id="line_335">However, if it were just me alone…</p>
<p id="line_336">Sorry—I cast a sympathetic gaze towards the rest of my dudes before leading <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others to the location.</p>
<p id="line_337">“Then, I’ll guide you guys to the female bath.”</p>
<p id="line_338">I casually started walking.

<p id="line_339">“Why do you ask? Don’t you need someone to guide you?”</p>
<p id="line_340"><em>I can’t panic here.</em></p>
<p id="line_341">I put on a face of calm composure and answer, feeling all righteous.</p>
<p id="line_342">“Because none of you know the direction. Moreover, the baths are also separated based on their effects. We even have a sauna. So, considering all of that, it’s best if I’m the one doing the explanations for all the details.”</p>

<p id="line_348">“Ahh, you (guests) don’t have to be so courteous with me. I wish to join you all as well during this rare occasion,” I answered as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Now, it was totally not strange for me to use the female bath.</p>

But it would pose no issues for the grand bathhouse in our nation. Even though it would be crowded if they were to visit the same spot, we had several different smaller bathhouses specifically for that occasion. Everyone went to try them in separate groups.

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_392">After a quick bath I went to check on the feast preparations.</p>
<p id="line_393">The venue was the banquet hall. Since we’d been hosting many feasts as of late, I thought it was a good idea to have a proper venue. It was a brand-new building. The building’s shape resembled a large, round dome, about the size of a gymnasium. Once you entered, the interior was wide and spacious with tatami<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="A type of mat used as flooring material in traditional Japanese households" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> floor mats bedded all over. It could also serve as an emergency shelter if such a situation arose, since there was enough room to squeeze in quite the number of people.</p>
<p id="line_394">Being a building with a large open space, we built it with a sturdy steel frame, though over time it was to transform into magisteel. In that regard, our country had a great advantage since we housed many <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s in possession of abundant magicule.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_395">The meals happened to be served on the dining table<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The phrase refers to a special dining table that is served separately with the dish to the table where the person is sitting. (since in traditional Japanese household they sit on the ground where there is no big dining table)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> just as I was in the middle of considering this. The tables were all topped with delicate bowls only found in classy restaurants.</p>
<p id="line_396">I sculpted and fired clay bowls during my spare time, which led to the children learning about it too. Since then, we had acquired lots of new and fine-looking works of pottery. Some were even colored by either extracting juice from medicinal plants or by mixing strange minerals into the clay to make colorful and vibrant products. The bowls used by every household were all made by the children. You never know until you try.</p>
<p id="line_397">Even the dining tables that were being presented to us were all top-notch pieces of furniture decorated with delicate patterns. Dold handled the part that required processing wood material. The children learned alongside him and we’ve helped schedule labor time for them to do this as part of their entertainment. Considering all of this, it seemed that my interest for hot springs and food containers was being reflected in the products we had here.</p>
<p id="line_398">Looking back to the time when I was still eating grass, my life today is surprisingly comfortable. I even got to taste the delicacies of food these days. I saw it was indeed true that people would work hard in order to better their life.</p>

<p id="line_400">Amazing. I’m truly moved that we were able to make such food. Not only was its taste exceptional, but it was also visually appealing. It was a testament to the skills of today’s Head chef, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And it goes without saying that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> took no part in the cooking process. Anything <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> cooks will look absolutely awful to begin with. Even though she now had the Unique Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Cook" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ we couldn’t let her risk it and be responsible for everyone’s food.</p>
<p id="line_401">These tempuras were some of the dishes <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> developed after viewing my memories. Milim also couldn’t stop praising the Karaage (Japanese style fried food), hamburgers, steak, and croquettes; there was also ebi fry (fried shrimp).</p>
<p id="line_402">As someone who wasn’t well versed with the intricacies of cooking, I couldn’t elaborate on the difference between ebi fry and tempura. To put it in simpler terms, “Ebi fry dips the shrimps in the coating ingredients first before frying with oil.” The coating would greatly alter the taste and texture. There were also varying ways to fry them, so it was a lot harder than expected to recreate the taste and texture of the food from my vague memory alone.</p>
<p id="line_403"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> endured a lot and worked hard for it. It’s all thanks to her efforts that the cuisine could be recreated to this extent. There were many exquisite dishes in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> too, but they unfortunately didn’t have Japanese delicacies. The meal <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> prepared was also along the lines of classy Western fare, so I guessed Japanese dishes were rare in this world.</p>
<p id="line_404">There was one reason for that—</p>
<p id="line_405">Among the Western Nations, few were coastal, making seafood a rare commodity. It would also be quite expensive to use magic to maintain the freshness of these products. Even if there were otherworlder chefs from Japan, it’d still be difficult to make food if you didn’t have the ingredients.</p>
<p id="line_406">Speaking of which, Yoshida-san also expressed his frustration about it, saying that there were too few varieties of alcohol, chiefly wines, which made it almost impossible to recreate many different types of cake. He was ecstatic when I told him I’d prepare them for him.</p>
<p id="line_407">Considering all this, you could understand just how blessed I was. Even with relevant knowledge, it was still an impossible feat to recreate dishes in such a short period of time. Especially Japanese ones, since gathering ingredients was already a difficult task in and of itself. I had to catch a bunch of fish in order to make things like Katsuobushi (dried tuna)<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Fishing side story refer to side story compilation, chapter 3 “Fishing”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>. By using my skill to perform ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Spatial Movement" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ I was able to create a means to transport and maintain freshness, therefore allowing us to accommodate different types of ingredients. But I still wanted to figure out a way to transport without using skills, so it became a topic of study in the future.</p>
<p id="line_408">Food is the essence of culture.</p>
<p id="line_409">If the food of a nation is not sufficiently developed, then such a nation’s culture would be of no significance to me. I believed that among the three pillars of life’s necessities: food, clothing and shelter, food was the most important. But everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion.</p>
<p id="line_410">Based on all these reasons, we toiled to develop all sorts of cuisines. It was far easier to get cereals like wheat, barley, and oats than I had imagined. I remembered seeing white bread in the capital of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, which was considered daily fare for the rich. By studying its production method, I was later able to produce them in my kingdom with relatively easier means.</p>
<p id="line_411">Our current research efforts centered around white rice. We haven’t improved it to the point of having satisfactory taste. Compared to the Japanese rice that had been researched and improved since time immemorial, the quality of ours was definitely inferior.</p>
<p id="line_412">But that was only natural. I didn’t expect things to go that smoothly anyways. We were able to quickly harvest by using magic to grow them. But with that being said, growing them in the winter season was no easy feat. Currently we only had a small amount growing in controlled indoor environments. It would take a long time before we could show any results.</p>
<p id="line_413">But there may be a solution. When I asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei if there was a better way, I got an immediate response. The method was to use <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Cook" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ to overwrite results. Since she could overwrite results, improving the quality of the product should be a piece of cake.</p>
<p id="line_414">But will it really work?</p>
<p id="line_415">I didn’t think anyone would accept such a method since it was quite the devious way to do things… But that’s just me thinking. Although at this point, it was probably already too late to be saying stuff like this. We’d used this method quite recklessly during the production of wines, so any intention of self-restraint was long gone.</p>
<p id="line_416">Our appetite took precedence over ethics. But we couldn’t rely on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s power during every harvest, so we needed to continue our research. However, that was excluding a small portion of—primarily for me—white rice. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was happy to help, so I handed the rice over to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and told her to only serve it during special occasions<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The word used here is “記念日” which refers to anniversary or commemoration day, likely holiday in Tempest Federation." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>. Today was one such special occasion. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was in attendance, among other things, hence we had to splurge lavishly. In order to ensure good relations from now on, we had to demonstrate our country’s value. We had both a carrot and a stick to offer. Your impression of someone will skyrocket if you get treated well despite having a negative impression in the past. If a delinquent youth were to suddenly commit a virtuous deed, his or her reputation would be greatly improved—that was my thought process at least. If we were lucky it might even make their previous impression of us turn a big one-eighty.</p>
<p id="line_417">Even though I didn’t think the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s were this shallow, it was still an effective and classic approach. With such a devious scheme in mind, I made sure the night’s feast was served with only the finest delicacies. And regarding the matter concerning white rice, something I insisted on having as an ex-Japanese, but it may have been unsuited for the appetites of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s.</p>
<p id="line_418">Either way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would probably be pretty happy about it. After all, I was quite delighted when I got to eat the white rice that I had not seen for such a long time. As for tempura, I was pretty sure everyone would think it was delicious after eating it. The merchants and adventurers sang their praises, and it had even won over <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s approval. I thought it would be fine considering the level of satisfaction it garnered so far.</p>
<p id="line_419">The dishes had all been served and were waiting on the table while I was buried in my own thoughts. The only thing left being to wait for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s to return from their bath.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_420">The seats were arranged in a U shape, with three seats at the head of the table. I was seated at the center, with Veldora and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to my left and right respectively. From this seat I could have everyone else in my line of sight. My own executives were sitting face to face with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. We intentionally arranged it this way to allow everyone to establish a friendly relationship during the feast.</p>
<p id="line_421">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s were led to the venue of the feast. All of them had finished bathing and were wearing either the yukatas or jinbeis (bath robe) that we had prepared for them. Reasonably speaking they should not have been used to these clothes. However, they seemed to have grown fond of them after putting them on. But that was only natural since these types of clothes would not lose to any sporty track suit in terms of comfort. Not only were they suitable for daily activities, but they also were able to serve as pajamas.</p>
<p id="line_422">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s nervously followed their guides to their seats. They seemed quite confused after noticing that there weren’t any chairs or tables. Moreover, furniture aside, they seemed baffled just by walking barefoot on the tatami. These were simply cultural differences, so their confusion was logical.</p>
<p id="line_423">The goblinas leading the way, on the other hand, were not nervous at all. They smoothly carried out their tasks, performing their duties spectacularly as if it were second nature. This was all thanks to Vesta’s training. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s all seemed astonished at the fact, and I could tell that they were embarrassed.</p>
<p id="line_424">The one walking at the front was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. She moved elegantly while I waited at the head seat. She was then seated next to me. Next it appeared to be Louis’s turn. He looked exactly the same as Roy, who played the part of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and gave off the regal air of a pope.

As soon as she sat on her seat, she turned to me with an air of conviction.</p>
<p id="line_425">“I sincerely apologize for the great trouble that I’ve caused you. Both for last time, as well as today’s incident. I acted entirely on my own.

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_471">Right, it would’ve been way too boring to continue with this solemn atmosphere, and it would’ve been a waste if these fine dishes got cold along with it. Most importantly, if this continued, there wouldn’t be a chance for Veldora to show up again. He’d throw a tantrum and things would get dicey.</p>
<p id="line_472">Supposedly, he shouldn’t need to eat food, just like me. But for some odd reason, he became quite obsessed with it ever since his revival. It was a known fact that he loved desserts such as cakes. He was also quite the picky eater. No idea if he knew what he was talking about or not. It seemed like he was looking forward to enjoying this free meal, so I should probably get this feast started as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="line_473"><em>Since that’s the case, let’s raise our cups.</em></p>
<p id="line_474">“Now then, let us raise our cups for the courageous battles fought by everyone here, cheers!”</p>
<p id="line_475">I came up with a random toast and started the feast. It felt best to drink a cold beverage right after a bath. And of course, I’d prepared that all beforehand. We were generously offering the secret wines produced in our nation en masse.</p>
<p id="line_476">Absolutely flawless.</p>
<p id="line_477">Wine was the mainstream drink, even in the kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. There was also beer, but it didn’t taste that good. Should I describe it as lacking in foam or carbonic acid? It was quite warm, so perhaps that was the main reason why the taste was underwhelming.</p>
<p id="line_478">But when it came to my nation, none of these were an issue. Don’t underestimate my enthusiasm for food. I researched day and night and had now developed more varieties than during the time I visited Dwargon. And the minute I mentioned that I wanted something, people would immediately start researching ways to make it. My current living environment was ideal to the point of being frightening. <em>Could it really be because I’ve become a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?

<p id="line_479">Ah, never mind.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_482">And my predictions were accurate.</p>
<p id="line_483">The female waitresses are all running around to refill wine for everyone. They became quite adept due to the experience of holding the many feasts in the past. The eyes of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s widened in surprise once they took their first sip. And as the food entered their mouth, they froze on the spot. They stole glances at their neighbor to see each other’s expressions, seemingly moved by the delicious taste of the food.</p>
<p id="line_484">I chuckled to myself. I was finally relieved seeing that they were enjoying the meal.</p>
<p id="line_485">The main dish was tempura, but we’d also prepared some seafood. We were even serving the chopped-up sashimi<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Raw fish cutlet, basically thicc nigiri without the rice" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> on the tables.

It wasn’t a perfect imitation of real soy sauce, but only people who were already familiar with the taste could tell the difference. For a first-time diner, this bootleg soy sauce was just as good as the real deal. Since there were different types of soy sauce as well, there may actually have been one with similar taste to ours in Japan. All in all, I was delighted with the fine quality of our product.</p>
<p id="line_486">Sashimi was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s specialty.

Therefore, it seemed that the training of chefs had gone smoothly as well. These chefs were able to flaunt their skills in a variety of exquisite dishes and served them one by one. Even though we went for a Japanese style cuisine, most people still enjoyed eating it. Especially <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, she appeared to be deeply moved as she ate her meal in silence.

<p id="line_487">“I mean, aren’t you going a bit overboard with all this?”</p>
<p id="line_488">“How is it going overboard?”</p>

<p id="line_497">“Did you say skill?”</p>
<p id="line_498">I nodded and replied with a “Hmm.”</p>
<p id="line_499">About that, I utilized the transportation channel of the orcs through <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘Stomach’ from his Unique Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gourmet" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ Transportation magic was usually unable to move food ingredients.

<p id="line_500">With that being said, we’d only prepared enough for this one feast. The orcs couldn’t be distracted from their construction projects simply because of my stubbornness. It was thanks to the people on vacation in the village who were willing to help that we were able to get the food this time. This was the limitation of using personal skills to conduct transportation. I would have to make this a research subject and improve beyond that.</p>

Basically it was the correct way of dining, so it was fine as long as it didn’t repulse other people. It was perhaps the hardest question we needed to resolve when it came to accommodating people who had never even seen chopsticks before. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the rest already knew how to use chopsticks.

But it was not the same case for merchants or adventurers coming from other nations. Moreover, we wished to make our nation an attraction for foreign nobilities, so we didn’t want them to feel obligated to use chopsticks.</p>
<p id="line_507">Coming from that point of view, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> presented a case worthy of consideration. She was using either knives, forks, chopsticks, or her fingers. The hotter dishes required chopsticks, but the rest could be eaten bare handed just fine. The methods of consumption varied depending on the dish.</p>
<p id="line_508">It would be meaningless if the guests didn’t enjoy eating, so they shouldn’t be restricted to just one way. It would be better to inform them of the different possible ways to dine and wait for them to slowly adapt.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_532">However, I recalled that bit of food there to be—</p>
<p id="line_533">My drunken mind began to race.</p>
<p id="line_534">That over there was black rice. We took samples of graminess plants and used magicule fluid—the highly concentrated liquid magicule formed in the sealed cave—to grow them. I did the experiment out of sudden curiosity and as a result made black rice that looked like it had been blended with squid ink. In my established view, rice was just white rice, so black rice didn’t look particularly appetizing. But its actual taste was without a doubt delicious. It even possessed incredibly high nutritional value, and so I added it to the production line with the name “Magic Black Rice”<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="In WN, this is called “Demon Rice” due to the name it used as “魔物米” (Monster rice), here in LN however, it is called “魔黑米” (Magic black rice).

It became the main fare in our nation, though I sort of remembered a huge issue it had—</p>
<p id="line_535">“AHHH, STOP! That thing is poisonous to humans!” I shouted, suddenly sober. But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Fritz" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s exclamation drowned me out.</p>
<p id="line_536">“T-this thing can restore mana!”</p>
<p id="line_537">I couldn’t stop <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Fritz" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> from taking a bite. Instead of being poisoned, this was how he reacted.</p>
<p id="line_538">“Oi, forget that! Is your body okay? Feeling anything wrong?”</p>
<p id="line_539">Bodies of weaker individuals would be affected after ingesting large amounts of magicules. The magicule content in this magic black rice was exceptionally high, so it would be the equivalent of poison for people of lesser abilities. But if ingested at an appropriate quantity, it could be used as both medicine and serve as a main dish. It shouldn’t be an issue for everyone else, but whether or not it would be safe for human consumption was anyone’s guess. We couldn’t be so hasty with human experiments. However, judging from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Fritz" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s reaction, the result was different from how I imagined.

<p class="space-break" id="line_540">«Answer. Mana restoration effect confirmed on individual “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Fritz" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.” If target possesses ‘Resistance’ against magicules, mana will likely be converted to energy.»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_541">I see, so that’s how it is.</p>
<p id="line_542">It must’ve been because he gave his all in the battle and rapidly depleted his mana that the effect of the food seemed so pronounced.</p>
<p id="line_543">I snapped back to reality as the other <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s began to discuss the magic black rice as well.

<p id="line_544">It couldn’t be helped then; we had to prepare the portion for all of them as well. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> probably felt the same way I had about the rice; she grimaced upon seeing its black color… But she wasn’t complaining, instead she chewed on the chazuke (tea/soup-soaked rice) made of the magic black rice. As for those who still weren’t satisfied with chazuke alone, we had also prepared onigiri (rice ball). It also seemed to be getting great reviews as more servings were ordered almost in the blink of an eye. I didn’t expect the magic black rice to be more popular than the white rice we specifically went out of the way to prepare for me. With that being said, it seemed like I was the only one who had a problem with its aesthetics. In reality it tasted wonderful. It was probably easier to accept for people who had never seen rice before. And because of that I found an unexpected effect of magic black rice.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_545">I was also looking forward to the promotion our nation would get as our guests enjoyed the food and beverages.

The future relations between <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the Holy Empire of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would depend on it. I hoped that we would reach a conclusion afterwards. The venue changed to the usual large meeting room. I took my seat while struggling to endure the headache.</p>
<p id="line_562">In reality, with the circumstances at hand, not only were we about to become enemies of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, we may even have potentially opened hostilities with the Holy Empire of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It was also a fact that the Pope’s Ministry gave permission for the Templar Knight Order to mobilize, and it could have caused major damage to our nation. Given that this was the case, we had to exercise caution when dealing with them.</p>
<p id="line_563">With that being said however, the real culprits in the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had been executed. As for the Templar Knight Order who aided them, there was not even one survivor remaining.</p>
<p id="line_564">But the ministry should take responsibility as well since they weren’t entirely unrelated… However, I’d already accepted <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s apology. Moreover, the culprits responsible for the incident had already been taken care of.</p>
<p id="line_565">Unlike <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I didn’t intend to fight against the Holy Empire of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It was meaningless to ask them for reparations as long as a friendly relationship could be formed. The monetary part was compensated with Clayman’s inheritance and the reparations from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And if we were to take any land, it would be too far away geographically anyways. It would’ve been difficult to manage, plus having such a distant land to rule would give me another headache. They already admitted their faults, so rather than demanding reparations, we decided to try together to build a friendly relationship in the future. And that was honestly my wish. I contemplated the matter as I awaited <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the rest.</p>

<p id="line_569">Now that everyone was present, we sat face to face and commenced the meeting. First, we needed to clear out the misunderstanding. Given this was the case, we began listing out the circumstances of both parties to have some context. We would be exchanging this information upon the start of the meeting.</p>
<p id="line_570">We checked on these things while confirming progress with their party. There was no point in voicing our complaints; right now we were only trying to verify the facts.

<p id="line_572">As for how things went down on the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> side, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> mentioned that there had already been a problem before <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> made their request.

It was an urgent matter that may have generated distrust among the believers. If left unattended, the followers might even renounce their faith. It might even end up causing the downfall of the influence of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

At the same time, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also wished to seek revenge.</p>
<p id="line_575">“Was it because of Shizu-san?”</p>
<p id="line_576">“Yes, that was the case. Now that I think about it, I seem to have been manipulated as well. Although I still have no idea who was behind all this, the eastern merchants must have had something to do with it.”</p>
<p id="line_577">“Merchants… Is that so? That’s gotta be the reason. There were merchants going in and out on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Clayman’s side as well. Moreover, although <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and his men are currently under my command, in the past they were all fully geared. I suspected that they may have had ties with some other countries, and as it turned out their trading partners were the eastern Merchants.”</p>
<p id="line_578">I nodded as I came to the realization. There were a large number of business transaction records in the ledger I asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to investigate. The Eastern Empire produced most of the merchandise that Dwargon originally exported. The Empire was undoubtedly doing business with Dwargon, yet the problem lay with the identity of its broker. There wasn’t any form of record.</p>
<p id="line_579"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had done a thorough investigation yet was still unable to find out the real identity of their trade partner. We even interrogated the captives to no avail. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Clayman was extremely cautious and ordered his subordinates to be meticulous with their work, not leaving behind any evidence. This was especially true for his associates in the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Moderate Clown Troupe" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as there wasn’t any record on them either.</p>
<p id="line_580">However, on the matter of who the trade partner was, there were still ways to determine the identity of the person. There was a vast array of artworks and rare magic items stored in Clayman’s castle that were collected from all over the world. Yet most of his weapons and gear came from the Empire. Because of teleportation magic, there wouldn’t be an issue with transportation no matter where he purchased them. Yet he specifically imported their goods from the Empire, meaning the two must’ve been somehow connected. Even though this could only count as indirect evidence, it was a decisive piece to victory.</p>
<p id="line_581">In addition, the same logic applied to the food ingredients. There was an abundance of fruit, bread, and dairy products as well as other consumable goods<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The term here is “嗜好品” which is a general phrase referring to goods that give a person sensational stimulus. This can range from food, drinks to cigarettes." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>—A large amount of food ingredients were stored in Clayman’s base. These goods couldn’t be teleported through magic alone and had to rely on physical transportation.</p>
<p id="line_582">Clayman’s territory before his death was the Puppet Nation of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Jistav" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. They seemed to conduct agricultural work with slavery, yet the agricultural products did not match up with the food items found in their storage. According to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s investigation, there were several food items that must have required exports from other nations. If that were the case, the prime suspect would be the neighboring Eastern Empire. Since Milim was self-sufficient in her land, she wouldn’t even have had the thought of trading with others. Furthermore, neither Milim nor ex-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had the money to trade such goods with others. That was another reason why I suspected that the people who colluded with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Clayman were from the Eastern Empire.</p>
<p id="line_583">“That’s right. They were the ones that told me that you had murdered Shizue-san. They also mentioned that you happened to be in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> at the time. That was why I had moved out in hopes of eliminating you.”</p>
<p id="line_584">“Indeed. The timing then was horrible, even now looking back at it just pisses me off—”</p>

<p id="line_587"><em>Oops, my bad, my bad.</em></p>
<p id="line_588">I only realized after <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> pointed out that my <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> (Demonic Aura) seemed to be leaking out.

<p id="line_589">I immediately apologized and continued.</p>
<p id="line_590">“Anyhow, in reality, it was the eastern merchant or something who was behind this. So, do you know his name?”</p>
<p id="line_591">“That person called himself Darm. But it must have been an alias.”</p>
<p id="line_592">An alias? I guess it made sense. But the name didn’t matter here. The important thing is the fact that the eastern merchant was the real culprit.</p>

<p id="line_594">“That was indeed the case. We were able to clarify that after interrogating Reyhiem.”</p>

<p id="line_597">“And the people doing the matchmaking were those eastern merchants?”</p>

<p id="line_618">“I see how it is now. Us immortals do tend to forget that they were originally humans. Even though they wouldn’t die without my spirit energy, they would definitely age.”</p>

<p id="line_621">“—That’s why those people probably came up with the plan to win <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s heart again. If they had collaborated with the eastern merchant while colluding with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Clayman in the dark, it would not be strange at all.

Then they would consider either eliminating Clayman or manipulating him as a puppet. It wasn’t clear what they were planning, but Clayman’s loyalty was most definitely true. If he could defeat <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it would’ve been up to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Seven Luminaries" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to attend to whatever they wished to do.

<p id="line_629">Once a powerful nation, like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, mobilized, the eastern merchants could sell their goods such as weapons, gear, and food at a high price.

It definitely wasn’t good to draw conclusions like this, but it was certainly one worthy of consideration.</p>
<p id="line_630">“Did they also send me to provoke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in order to get rid of me?

<p id="line_663">I replied with a “Yeah” since Renard asked. You could figure it out if you thought about it calmly.

<p class="space-break" id="line_665">In other words, I could interpret it as someone intentionally framing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_711">“If that’s the case, we can only obey.”</p>
<p id="line_712">She nodded in agreement with Louis’s statement and began to contemplate how to conclude the whole ordeal. There was however someone who still held a strong opposition.</p>
<p id="line_713">“Diplomatic tie? If we do that—“ Renard said.</p>
<p id="line_714">He peeked at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, as if uncertain if he should bring up his issues with the proposal.</p>
<p id="line_715">“It’s actually not bad.

<p id="line_716">“Indeed. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono and his party are worthy of trust.

<p id="line_718"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Fritz" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> responded somewhat frivolously while Arnaud and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ritase" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> added on. Even the man of few words, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Bacchus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, gave the green light. However, Renard was still very cautious despite what his companions had said. As expected from the vice-commander of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight Order" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>; he was not willing to compromise that easily. But the circumstances must have given him some ideas, so Renard spoke with determination.</p>
<p id="line_719">“However, there are still problems remaining. What should we do about our doctrines? Due to its influence, the whole world will point fingers at the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. We can’t allow such a thing to happen no matter what.”</p>
<p id="line_720">The doctrines—the prohibition of co-existence with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—was that it? Indeed, once they acknowledged us, what would become of those doctrines? Things seemed to have become more complicated just when we thought it would all be over. Yet just as my thoughts went in that direction, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the individual responsible, dropped a bombshell.</p>
<p id="line_721">“How boring. I didn’t make those doctrines anyway, so I won’t consider it to be a betrayal if we stop following them. Those are basically just some signs of direction for the lost lambs of the civilian masses, which the people in charge at the time drained their brains in coming up with.”</p>
<p id="line_722"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s statement had quite the impact. Not only the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, but even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was astonished as she muttered: “What?! That’s the first time I’ve heard of it…”</p>
<p id="line_723">“Is that so? It’s nothing strange really even if you didn’t know about it. Even though the base scriptures of the doctrines are still available for browsing, the original manuscripts about its origin have long since been lost. You should have an idea of how our religion came about after reading those manuscripts,” Louis replied flatly.</p>
<p id="line_724">This was Louis’s explanation:</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_725">It is said that the origin of the doctrines was for the protection of the people believing in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It may be a different case for advanced species such as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Louis, however lower vampires require raw human blood to maintain their livelihood. Moreover, it was rumored that the blood of humans overflowing with joy is particularly appetizing. At the time when <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the world reigned supreme, people had to strive just to survive. And in terms of the vampires, they could only receive inferior human blood, which posed a life or death problem for the vampiric race. It was because of that, that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> took the opportunity to draft a plan to protect humans.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_726">The reason why she moved her kingdom seemed to have been due to Veldora-san… I managed to suppress my urge to inquire about it. After all, trying to pry into the matter would simply be asking for more trouble.</p>
<p id="line_727">“Because I needed to protect my innocent people, I allowed the humans to live with joy. Moreover, if there is ever any threat posed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, the humans would feel reassured that someone is protecting them. In this way they can peacefully enjoy their life. The people of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were thus protected in the name of god.”</p>
<p id="line_728">Although this may be a bad metaphor, they seemed to be little more than “livestock.”</p>
<p id="line_729">Even though it was said that they needed to suck out raw blood, they really only required a tiny amount, mostly unnoticeable by the donor. And after all, there was an overwhelming number of human citizens compared to the population of vampires there, so it was understandable.</p>
<p id="line_730">The price of living a safe and secured life was by donating one’s blood. It’s almost a win-win situation.</p>
<p id="line_731">“In other words, in the holy scripture—in the doctrines of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminism" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—many entries were added to prevent unnecessary casualties because of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_732">“Indeed, that is the case.”</p>
<p id="line_733">“To me, the important thing is having a heart of belief. Aren’t you all capable of using ‘Holy Magic’ due to your faith in me? It is a form of contract and an iron law. The task of protecting my people is a duty for my vassals, something I don’t really value at all.”</p>
<p id="line_734">In other words, her conclusion was as follows:</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_735">No tolerance for coexistence with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—this doctrine is nothing but a cheap product in an attempt to control the people’s faith. If that was the case, there was no need to follow such a doctrine strictly. They couldn’t afford to go to the extent of forcefully altering the doctrines, which would plunge the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> into chaos. To put it simply, they only needed to find a reason to persuade the people to accept us.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_736">This was the solution I guess, but Renard still didn’t seem to be able to approve, wearing a grimace on his face.</p>
<p id="line_737">“I can sort of understand that our doctrines didn’t come from the divine will of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. But there is a very real question at hand, that we have always been leading our lives following the doctrines. There will be problems if we simply discard them…”</p>
<p id="line_738">Indeed, if they were to completely ignore the previous directions, the followers and the current establishment of the Church would no doubt experience extreme backlash. Even if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> showed herself before the public, there was no saying whether or not they will believe she was the real god itself. More importantly, there was no way <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would ever do such a thing… If that is the case, it would go against the long-established beliefs of people who still stood with the doctrines and cause internal division.</p>
<p id="line_739">Renard was evidently quite troubled by this matter.</p>
<p id="line_740">“Even if that’s the case, we still have to do it. I was trying to keep the situation down a notch until the issue gets resolved, yet you had already mobilized hundreds of troops. The news has probably already spread to the other nations. Moreover, didn’t all the reporters from the Western Nations witness the defeat of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Three Martial Sages" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> inquired in a serious tone as she shifted her gaze, glancing over at me.</p>

After the reporters’ eyewitness testimony of this chain of events, the status of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the rest of the guardians of mankind was surely going to suffer a disastrous decline.</p>
<p id="line_742">In addition to the news of the defeat of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, there would likely be unnecessary chaos. Although according to how <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> put it, he may be able to pressure the reporters…</p>
<p id="line_743"><em>Ayy, how troublesome.</em></p>
<p id="line_744">“If that’s the case, we can just resolve it by claiming that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I ended in a draw.

My true identity as a slime is already public knowledge, and if the broadcast adds on the information that I am a reincarnated otherworlder, shouldn’t that, to some extent, be acceptable to the public?”</p>
<p id="line_745">“That indeed sounds like a great proposal for us. But are you really okay with that?

<p id="line_749">Anything goes with things like victory or defeat.

The rescued reporters apparently became his tools to exploit, so right now he seemed to be pushing his plan forward with an iron fist. As reports have pointed out, sooner or later <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be crowned as the new king.

I defeated Clayman in front of their eyes, which had quite the effect in setting an example. As long as I remained alive, even if the news of my defeat came out, they probably wouldn’t believe it.

<p id="line_768">It gave the impression that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wasn’t so unified either. But it wasn’t anything strange. I guess that’s just what it means to be an organization.</p>
<p id="line_769"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s voice was ruthless and cold, so no one dared to object. She planned to take the opportunity and push all the charges onto the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Seven Luminaries" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

It wasn’t an issue we could have a say in, so we just let them have their fun.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_770">Then we begin to discuss the details.</p>
<p id="line_771">For future communication, Arnaud and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Bacchus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> decided to temporarily stay here, though they would first need to return to their home nation for preparations. They apparently planned to bring some civil servants along as well. As for us, we planned to take the time to construct a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminism" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> church for their accommodation. I didn’t think it would take more than two weeks’ time. We should be seeing believers of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminism" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> coming in and out of our nation in the future as well. Although it was disconcerting to acknowledge religious freedom, it would all work out in the end. If there’s a will there’s a way.</p>
<p id="line_772">Honestly, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t believe in any god. There wasn’t a single almighty deity that was widely recognized in this world, which was quite different compared to my previous world. There were indeed religions, but they were more like, for example, tributes to the earth deities. In a practical sense, they believed in deities who would actually respond to their prayers with actual aid. A good example would be the Worshippers of Dragons who revered Milim. Among the many religions of this nature, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminism" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> held the greatest power. The hands and feet of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that were the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s would aid the weak, thus earning the trust of the public. If we changed our perspective, we could just consider this as our nation receiving a branch of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that would help the weak.</p>
<p id="line_773">I figured that even though there may not be such a chance, we may still help each other out if there was ever any trouble. When any threats appear, we may fight alongside the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. Then, we’d have no reason to say no. Naturally they would be under surveillance, but with some freedoms.</p>
<p id="line_774">And just like that, we were able to come to a compromise on the whole thing.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_775">This concluded the difficult topic.</p>
<p id="line_776">We made a deal with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, thus the plan for the Holy Empire of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to acknowledge us had also been properly laid out. Those would be sufficient as compensation. We would only have to build a good relationship through communication on top of that. The duration was one hundred years, so we would have to utilize this period of time wisely so both parties could better acquaint themselves. Therefore, we agreed upon doing exchanges with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s on a regular basis, starting with the sharing of our technology. This battle had greatly damaged their weapons as well, so I suggested that we would help repair them. On the surface, we were just demonstrating how high the technological standards of our nation were, but our real intention was to examine the properties of their weapons.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_777">We first got our hands on a set of those rare armaments of light<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Referring to the “Spirit Armament” in vol 7." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei said it would offer the user’s mana—which is their spirit aura—to the spirits so that they could be materialized. Because the sample had been destroyed due to overcharging, I exchanged it with a set of armor that Garm crafted. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s seemed to think it was a bad deal, but they still gave it to us without reservations since they felt sorry for the incident this time.</p>
<p id="line_778">I initially thought that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would have objected, but it turned out she didn’t. That’s why I decided to gift her a sword that I personally handcrafted. And speaking of the sword <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> used, its name was “Moonlight Rapier (Moonlight).” I heard that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gifted it to her and that it possessed great power. Or I should say, it was a little overpowered. I figured that it was just a unique-grade weapon of the highest level, yet it turned out to be a legendary weapon.</p>
<p id="line_779">According to Kaijin and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the quality of magisteel evolved over time. That’s why after a period of time, first-class gear would apparently evolve as well, their quality increasing exponentially. The evidence being the items retrieved from ancient ruins. It was said that they’ve discovered ultra-quality gear that modern technologies were unable to replicate. These things were crowned the titles of legendary and were often sealed away, so normally there wouldn’t even be a chance to lay eyes on them.</p>
<p id="line_780">Both <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Garm seemed to be aiming to craft such a weapon. The two were mesmerized after laying eyes on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s Moonlight Rapier. I hoped they would reach that goal someday.</p>
<p id="line_781">Moreover, due to the sword’s incredible nature, it was only used in crucial moments. If she tried to unsheathe the sword in the town, it would cause enormous hazards to the surroundings, considering its level. It would be like carrying a rocket launcher instead of a pistol for self-defense. There’s no way you could just casually swing something like that around on a daily basis. I gifted her a sword based on these thoughts, and she seemed to like it a lot more than I expected.</p>
<p id="line_782"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s rapier was destroyed after I devoured and recycled it, so I created a new sword after analyzing and improving upon her previous weapon.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="This is referring to her rainbow sword" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> Its quality reached unique-grade, so it shouldn’t have been much different in practice. After all, even its special ability of ‘Dead End Rainbow’ was recreated.</p>
<p id="line_783">I also took in the broken greatsword called Dragon Buster or something. Its quality was surprisingly garbage. Seriously, how in the world could that thing possibly defeat Veldora?</p>
<p id="line_784">There were also things like the ‘Gear of Holy Spirit’—but they wouldn’t allow us to see that.

<p id="line_827">It was no use telling me these things, not to mention the fact that I still haven’t been able to reach my end goals anyway.</p>
<p id="line_828">“No, this is still not enough. The transportation of goods is way too slow while the speed of information transmission is subpar as well. Even though there is magic, the issues concerning our living environment and food have only been improved to some extent.”</p>

Moreover, we plan to establish an influence on the Western Nations.”</p>
<p id="line_834">“What are you on about? I want an explanation.”</p>
<p id="line_835"><em>Since you want an explanation, an explanation you will get.</em></p>
<p id="line_836">“I have a lot of ideas, first of all—”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_837">I launched into a discussion about my ideas for the future while eating the sukiyaki. The current plan was to have the human society accept us. Given that all the leaders of the world had come to know us, this plan was halfway to success. There were even reports of suspected spies being sighted in our nation. We thus showcased our harmless side to them without even noticing. The news should also have been spreading among merchants and adventurers so that the civilians of different kingdoms would learn about the prospect of our coexistence. However, it would probably take some time before such an idea firmly took root. But we’d get there one day, so there’s no need to rush.</p>
<p id="line_838">Next in line was the preparation of roads. We were working on that aspect as well at the moment. We were constructing trade routes that could be traveled with the guarantee of safety. The roads to Dwargon and Blumund had been opened and now we were planning to commence new construction projects to the Sorcerer’s Dynasty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I also planned to work on the construction of the road to the Beast Kingdom <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Eurazania" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the future.</p>
<p id="line_839">Going hand in hand with this was the matter concerning communication. Since I had no concept for wireless transmission, I had to give up the idea. Now, even though it may be easy to seek answers from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, it would be difficult to get everyone else to understand. The three dwarven brothers and Kaijin could probably understand, but I couldn’t rely on them for everything.</p>
<p id="line_840">This proved to be a problem for future study. I wished to place my hope in the children and build up schools for their education. Right now, we were only at private school (Terakoya)<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Not exactly private school in the western sense. The term here is “寺子屋” which is referring to private institute in the ancient Japan Edo Period for educating commoners. In other words, this is a very basic level of education." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> level where we taught kids about writing and basic arithmetic. But I aspired to use my network formed during my time as a teacher to hire some human tutors.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_841">But going back to the original topic, let’s talk about communication. Right now, the available communication network was mostly formed by communicative crystal balls that only mages could operate. Moreover, they stood the risk of being stolen, given that they were magic items after all. In fact, there were several cases of theft involving them. More importantly, we had to assume that there may be no available mage when an emergency call needed to be made. We had to find a medium that didn’t run the risk of being stolen and was also accessible to anyone. These were quite demanding terms, yet there turned out to be a solution.</p>
<p id="line_842">I had my eyes on ‘Sticky Steel Web’ and magisteel. I already tried it with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The conductivity of telepathic thoughts through my ‘Sticky Steel Web’ was extremely high. There were also magicules within it, lending the clarity of communication a very high quality. There was also magisteel, which possesses large amounts of magicule as well. That’s why I suspected it had similar properties to ‘Sticky Steel Web.’ It turned out to be exactly the case after I ran an experiment. That’s why I decided to use them effectively.</p>
<p id="line_843">I would process magisteel into cables with a diameter of around one centimeter and connect them to all the major cities using ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shadow Step" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ That alone wouldn’t do the trick, but in conjunction with the device that Vesta and the rest developed, it was going to convert one’s thoughts into voice and image. The device could be run even without mana, which was why the devices could be installed as soon as they were developed. Therefore, all we could do was to start preparing the necessary magisteel.</p>
<p id="line_844">Due to our nation having a huge population of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the iron ores stored in our warehouses would become magic ores overtime. We would be processing them into “Magic Steel String” and have individuals capable of ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shadow Step" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ connect the wires. Since there weren’t any obstacles, setting them up would likely be effortless. Depending on how much we could make, we would not be connecting wires exclusively to major cities, but also the villages along the main lines of the network as well. We had that part planned out too. We just had to wait for the development of a transmitter.</p>
<p id="line_845">Coming from a world thoroughly defined by the Information Age, I couldn’t overlook the importance of transmission speed.</p>
<p id="line_846">“What do you think, won’t it be convenient after it is completed?” I bragged to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_847">Once the communication network was complete, we would focus on creating recreation opportunities and developing our culture. My dreams were getting grander day by day, leaving tons more things left to do. I hoped that with the fulfillment of these dreams, we could finally live a safe and comfortable life.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_848">Without noticing, the venue of the feast had turned dead silent.

I just gave up my struggle and considered the incident my own doing.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_857">But apparently, I wasn’t the only one getting in trouble because of alcohol.</p>

<p id="line_954">No matter how hard the problem was, “Everyone, let’s all work hard and find a solution!”—As soon as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gave such senseless speeches, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> under his rule would strive with all they had.

<p id="line_963">There was also Commander of the Pegasus Knight Order <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dolph" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He sighed rather helplessly and said: “Since everyone has spoken, I can only clean up after them.

<p id="line_964">This type of responsibility always fell on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dolph" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s shoulders, but he didn’t begrudge them for that.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_965">And so—</p>
<p id="line_966">With these heroes and highest of officials deciding on this new policy, no one could object—but that was just on the surface, the ministers still held on to some of their own doubts. Nevertheless, they would go on to publicly support the decision wholeheartedly, with the hero’s decision as cover.</p>
<p id="line_967">There was a single reason for that; as citizens of a powerful tech-nation, the cultural enlightenment the king mentioned earlier excited them greatly. As a nation, there hadn’t been much progress despite their continuous efforts in technological research. Yet that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had uncaringly and fearlessly pushed forward research at an unprecedented rate. The report sent by their ex-colleague Marquis Vesta supported this as well. Some even envied the freedom he had in that regard.</p>
<p id="line_968">“How can Vesta-dono get to do whatever he wants like that?! Unforgivable!”</p>
<p id="line_969">“I know, right?! Have you heard? It is rumored that the roads there have even had new anti-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> barriers installed.”</p>
<p id="line_970">“And streetlamps. I heard they are also developing some sort of communication device.”</p>
<p id="line_971">“Developing potions alone must not be satisfying enough, it makes me jealo—I mean outraged at what they are doing!”</p>
<p id="line_972">Along such lines, the ministers revealed their actual feelings towards the topic. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> smiled wryly as he overheard their complaints. He coughed expectantly. Almost like a signal, the meeting room went silent instantly. The ministers turned their eyes to focus on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_973">“I’ve come to a decision. Our nation will trust the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and move forward alongside him! We will be the ones to accept and carry out the duties of preserving their technology. Even if they get defeated by the army of heaven, their technology must not be lost! This is the policy of mine, the policy of the Armed Nation of Dwargon!”</p>
<p id="line_974">No one planned to complain about it from the start since King <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> always put his nation first, concerning himself with its future.</p>
<p id="line_975">The ministers all bowed their heads in expressing their agreement to his speech.</p>
<p id="line_976">“Kukuku, trying to capitalize fully on the benefits, I see? It sounds a lot better to just say it rather than wrapping it in lofty rhetoric,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Vaughn" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s comment resonated with everyone present.</p>
<p id="line_977">They’d also decided to accept the proposal from Holy Empire of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, thus concluding the meeting. Some other civil officials could handle the procedures next, to form pacts with not only Tempest Federation, but also the Holy Empire of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Although it would probably be a future matter, but these two nations would likely collaborate with Dwargon to prepare for the “Tenma Great War.” It was still unknown whether this judgement was correct or not.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_978"><em>But this is good enough</em>—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought to himself. As everything appeared to be settled and King <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> made his leave, one of the ministers raised his hand.</p>
<p id="line_979">“Sire, may I borrow a moment of your time?”</p>
<p id="line_980">He hurried the individual with his eyes to report.</p>
<p id="line_981">“The thing is this, my liege, Rigurd-dono has sent an invitation.

<p id="line_982">“A presentation announcing his inauguration as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?

The minister being questioned, naturally, couldn’t answer either. He simply remained silent; his eyes wide open with fear.</p>
<p id="line_983">And instead, the other ministers began to argue.</p>
<p id="line_984">“It must be an excuse. He probably just wants to show everyone how close our nation is by inviting sire there.”</p>
<p id="line_985">“Hmm—hasn’t that ceremony of his been hosted in our nation already?”</p>
<p id="line_986">“Oh oh, so it’s about that event! Marquis Vesta told me about it before.

<p id="line_988">“Woah, that does sound quite interesting. The hotel in that country was also rather amazing. You get to enjoy taking a pleasant hot spring bath. The food was delicious and even the receptionists had great manners as well. I believe they were mentored by Vesta and thus were truly impressive.

<p id="line_989">Judging from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Vaughn" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s look, even if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t participate, he would probably volunteer himself in the king’s place.</p>

It was after all, a difficult task trying to maintain prestige in front of the many ministers.</p>
<p id="line_994"><em>That guy… He dares to set up this type of trap to give me a hard time… How bold!</em></p>

<p id="line_996">“So what does your Majesty think? Rigurd-dono did say ‘It won’t be easy to get his Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to be present, but if he is willing to attend the festival, we will be preparing the finest seat in hope of his arrival.’ They also seem to have informed the leaders of the other nations, so the available seats seem to be limited. He also mentioned that ‘Since there will be many people attending, the venue will likely be in chaos on that day, so please respond as soon as possible,’ as a special reminder for us,” the minister, trembling, reported Rigurd’s message to the silent <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_997">Such a message was still considered quite inappropriate even while using a polite tone, which the minister worried may have angered <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

In fact, he was actually somewhat confused by how the minister could have such a misunderstanding. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s Unique Skill ‘Dictator’ read the minister’s thoughts with ease.

<p id="line_998">“I shall attend the presentation and take the opportunity to tour the city.”</p>
<p id="line_999">At his decisive answer, the other ministers launched another round of complaints.</p>
<p id="line_1000">“Sire! No matter how close you are to this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono, you shouldn’t say this.

<p id="line_1001">“Indeed. Moreover, it may not be clear as to how many people they are trying to invite, but the royalty and nobility from other nations shouldn’t have the free time to attend just like us. I don’t think they would accept their invitations so easily.”</p>
<p id="line_1002">“On top of that, your Majesty, attending in person will also lead to all sorts of problems!”</p>
<p id="line_1003">The ministers did make some good points.

Moreover, Tempest Federation has considerable military power now, so many must want to get some inside information on them.

<p class="space-break" id="line_1022">In the Emperor’s castle, there was a large beautiful and majestic garden containing a large number of rare, wild animals. The garden was maintained using a private fund from the emperor—in other words, the emperor’s personal stash. The emperor enjoyed many privileges, and so he received enormous profits from them. The maintenance cost only accounted for a small portion of the funds, and so this beautiful garden was of no financial consequence.</p>
<p id="line_1023">Moreover—</p>
<p id="line_1024">The maintenance of the entirety of this majestic palace did not use a single cent of tax money. It was evidence of the unimaginable wealth possessed by the Emperor who stood at the peak of the Sorcerer’s Dynasty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1025">Two persons were currently resting in this garden.

<p id="line_1026">Sitting opposite to him was another person.

<p class="space-break" id="line_1028">According to official statements, the gender of the individual was unclear. The Emperor was born with the beauty to rival that of a female. It was declared to the outside world as such, but in reality, she was indeed a woman.</p>
<p id="line_1029">The only thing, however, was that her age remained unknown. Her elven blood was extremely pure, which, in turn, prevented her from aging. She was also a living witness to history, making it a major taboo to inquire about the Emperor’s age.</p>
<p id="line_1030">Her noble appearance was also not lacking in tenderness. Often, due to her petite figure, she was mistaken for a young girl.</p>
<p id="line_1031">She had a pair of almond eyes. Her jade-green pupils looked as if they were capable of seeing through anything. Her skin was smooth like water with its white color akin to fallen snow. Her silver hair ran down onto her pink and soft cheeks. The distinctive pair of long ears with sharp tips peeked out of her silver hair. It blended with the rest of her body perfectly.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/illustrations/image3.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_1032"></p>
<p id="line_1033">She was the most authentic of the elven race—a so called “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="high elf" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,” the supreme existence.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1034">For an instant, Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was also mesmerized by her beauty, but considering that the fury of his wife and daughter was far more terrifying, he quickly came back to his senses. He coughed and faced the Emperor once more.</p>
<p id="line_1035">Emperor Elmesia held herself with decorum, seated on an elegant-looking wooden chair.</p>
<p id="line_1036">“Sire,” Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said, “as previously reported to you about the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom, they delivered an invitation to me this time.”</p>
<p id="line_1037">The Duke took out the envelope from his pocket and handed it over carefully. He had already checked it to ensure it was of no danger. He was aware of the content written in it but refrained from speaking. She hated it when people revealed things without confirming it herself—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> knew about the temperament of the Emperor all too well. Yet still, he felt unease.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1038"><em>I can’t believe that guy actually got the recognition to become an official <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That aside… What is the meaning of calling me to his festival?</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1039">In fact, there was actually no need for Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to show the letter to the Emperor as it was meant for the Duke himself. Yet the letter wrote “If you are attending, please reply with the number of attendees.”</p>
<p id="line_1040">If it were asking for the number of participants, it could be interpreted as an invitation to bring whoever one wished.</p>
<p id="line_1041">Then, who should he invite? That was the problem.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1042">It was natural to bring guards along since the Duke couldn’t attend alone. Some nobles caught wind of him having a meeting there in the past, so many had stated their wish to visit as well. The topic regarding Tempest Federation becoming a new trading nation had become popular among the high-ranked nobles in Sorcerer’s Dynasty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1043">Yet nobles were not the only ones interested. In the past, when he reported the results of the meeting with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to the Emperor, she glared at him coldly and commented in annoyance: “—Oh. So you went to such an interesting place by yourself? Well aren’t you a bigshot, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>; you must have <em>had a lot of fun</em>. Why did you ditch me and go by yourself? Let alone proclaiming yourself my envoy and establishing diplomatic ties with them. Given the significance of the matter, I would have wanted to see things for myself.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1044">This was how it went down…</p>
<p id="line_1045">But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had things to say in his defense as well. He may have visited <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the name of rescuing his daughter, it was still considered the real “kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.” Even though he had been using a homunculus, he’d had no idea what type of situation he’d run into there. He couldn’t say with confidence that there would not be any danger, so how could he have invited the Emperor Elmesia to that kind of place?</p>
<p id="line_1046">Yet she still scolded Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> harshly, “With such an intriguing slime out there, I would’ve wanted to see it with my own eyes. I would have gotten to meet a new <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>; in all my years, I’ve never encountered such a thing before. Yet you got to enjoy all of that by yourself? Do you know what ‘snatching credit’<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The expression here is “抜け駆け” which means “doing something first/taking the credit of something first”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> is? Even my trusted aide dares to treat me like that, what a sad life of an Emperor I am living—“ Her complaints kept on firing without pause—</p>
<p id="line_1047">“—I’m so envious… Hold on a second, isn’t this just too out of line? There’s no knowing how much fun you had… No actually, there’s no knowing how dangerous it was, so how dare you act on your own. Absolutely unacceptable!”</p>
<p id="line_1048">…Something along those lines, it was a messy meltdown.</p>
<p id="line_1049">It was more like whining than a scolding. In front of her subjects, her emotionless expression was like an icy mountain, and so people were led to believe that Emperor Elmesia was cruel and ruthless. The only time the Emperor showed the other side of her personality was when alone with Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or with one other individual. So it could be said that the responsibility on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s shoulders was particularly heavy.</p>
<p id="line_1050"><em>Aren’t you overplaying your feigned innocence a bit too much! </em><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> always complained internally.</p>
<p id="line_1051">Nowadays his budget was frozen because of the Emperor’s tantrum, and the plan for technological collaboration with Tempest Federation was put on hold. That’s why he wanted to pamper the Emperor back into a good mood so he could resume preparations to collaborate with Tempest.</p>
<p id="line_1052">If he did not inform the Emperor about this beforehand, and went to attend by himself, he would definitely have pissed her off. At that point <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> feared that the consequences would not be so simple as to freeze his budget.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1053">The letter stated that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was hosting a presentation, but in reality, it must be some form of intimidation.

There seemed to be a festival that would be hosted alongside with elaborately prepared recreational activities. It was unknown what would be included in it, but their programs appeared to be quite substantial…</p>
<p id="line_1054">Given that the event seemed rather lively, there was no way Emperor Elmesia, someone who’d been living an all-too-boring life would miss it. It was foreseeable that she would inquire about the event from start to end and interrogate <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> if he did not report to her. The intensity of that fury would definitely be beyond his imagination.</p>
<p id="line_1055">Based on these considerations, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> decided not to hide anything and thus was showing her the letter now.</p>
<p id="line_1056">As he was thinking about this, Elmesia lifted her head as she finished the letter. He quickly tightened his posture.

He knew what Elmesia wanted to say. But he couldn’t point it out directly. It would make national headlines if the Emperor Elmesia were to attend the festival. Knowing the significance of such an event, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t dare to say too much.</p>

<p id="line_1063">“My most sincere apologies, Madam.

Although he doesn’t possess combat ability, he is still under protection due to his identity as an otherworlder.

Allow me to explain. It seems that Yoshida-san’s confectionery has been getting ingredients from someone else since then. Because the variety of items has increased splendidly, the quality of taste also seems to have increased. And most importantly, I’ve been getting goods from him by offering financial support,” and as such, Elmesia began to explain in detail.</p>

His identity as an otherworlder alone was enough to make him a target of investigation, so naturally he already knew the relevant information about him.</p>
<p id="line_1071">According to his intelligence, Kaoru Yoshida ran a dessert place called Cafe (Kissaten)<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The term here is “喫茶店” (Kissaten), it is a Japanese style cafe store that serves both tea and coffee" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> in the capital of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1072">He allegedly didn’t have any skills, but whether this was true or not remained unknown. However, his bakery skill of making dessert was top notch. It was rumored that even the head of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> showed up to taste his food.

<p id="line_1073">“I once went out of my way to invite Yoshida-san here.

So I hoped to make him the appointed pâtissier of our nation. Yet I was turned down. No matter how much money I would offer, Yoshida-san was not willing to come here—”</p>
<p id="line_1074">According to Emperor Elmesia, the man named Yoshida couldn’t be moved by money. So she was forced to depend solely on the limited number of souvenir gifts she had to make it through life.</p>

<p id="line_1076">“Recently however, Yoshida-san said that he was closing shop. Whether he is opening a new store or moving away is still under investigation… With that being said, don’t you think it is a big problem to not be able to eat desserts during break time?”</p>
<p id="line_1077">“I don’t think so, what is the issue?”</p>
<p id="line_1078">“Oh—how could you say such things? <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> really likes the desserts there.

<p id="line_1079">“Madam, w-what are talking about!”</p>
<p id="line_1080">“In fact, she has actively attended all of our regular tea parties.”</p>
<p id="line_1081">A truly shocking fact. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had always thought that his daughter didn’t even want to come near her hometown. To him, Elmesia’s series of confessions left him broken and depressed.</p>
<p id="line_1082">It was one thing that her two bodyguards had been useless, but it was an entirely different matter that the people he sent to watch over her didn’t report anything of this sort.</p>
<p id="line_1083"><em>Those guys… I’m gonna teach them a lesson later</em>—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asserted.</p>
<p id="line_1084">First however, it was more important to hear what Elmesia had to say.</p>
<p id="line_1085">“Now the matter is of utmost importance!”</p>
<p id="line_1086">“Right? I’ve actually gotten hold of some very reliable information about it using my wealth and influence.”</p>
<p id="line_1087">“Do tell.”</p>
<p id="line_1088">“It’s really shocking, the place he wants to move to is that Tempest Federation you visited! What did you see when you last visited that nation?”</p>
<p id="line_1089">After being pointed out by her, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> recalled something as well. He’d heard that the dishes served by that kingdom were all delicious, and his daughter <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was greatly moved by one of the desserts. He remembered <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> exclaiming excitedly, “As expected from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, you were even able to recreate that new dish!”</p>
<p id="line_1090">“Ah!

<p id="line_1091">“Seriously now, are you really as smart as they say?”</p>
<p id="line_1092">Hearing this, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s confidence vanished with the comment: “I’m such an embarrassment…” he apologized earnestly.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1093">The reason why his boss, the Emperor had been upset was now clear. She misunderstood and thought that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wanted to have all the desserts for himself.

<p id="line_1094">“How would I know whether you would have done it or not; with a father’s love for his daughter and all that, you know…”</p>
<p id="line_1095">Due to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s obliviousness on these many subjects, the Emperor’s suspicion towards him gradually dissipated. Yet this lack of knowledge turned to her mocking him of such unawareness of these important incidents.</p>
<p id="line_1096"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> willingly endured the blow. He then switched his mindset to discuss another thing.</p>
<p id="line_1097">“By the way, Madam. We should get back on track, how will we respond to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono?”</p>
<p id="line_1098">Elmesia grinned sneakily upon being asked by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1099">“About that…”</p>
<p id="line_1100">She was keeping him in the loop and without giving an answer. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> fought back his impatience, he was not stupid enough to cut in now. As mentioned before, once the Emperor moved out, it would become a major state affair. If it were initiated by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, there would most definitely be some objections. Things would undoubtedly become difficult if someone tried to intervene. The powerful nation of Sorcerer’s Dynasty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has prospered under the rule of Sorcerer King, Emperor Elmesia.</p>
<p id="line_1101">Under her were the thirteen noble houses<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The system in the source sounds more like the Japanese aristocracy, so a brief explanation with the original texts just to clarify.

Everyone pledged their loyalty towards the Emperor Elmesia. Basically, she permitted each house to have executive power over their own domains. The imperial house on the other hand, relied on the taxation from the thirteen vassal families.</p>
<p id="line_1102">None of the noble houses possessed any military capabilities. With all of the military power concentrated within the imperial house, the Emperor was the supreme commander of the military, responsible for mediating relations between states.</p>

Elise was also the grandmother of Emperor Elmesia; yet another person that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had to bow towards. Something off-topic: <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s brother—and Elmesia’s father—was tragically killed during a battle against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

To him, it was tale from ancient times.

It was no wonder that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> couldn’t raise his head in front of her.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1104">Now, to put aside the matter of his mother Elise, let’s talk about the people from the other aristocratic families… There were some mean characters among them as well.</p>
<p id="line_1105">There were lords who hid in their domains without any official duty and weren’t willing to come out. Then there were those that attempted to meddle in state affairs using their authority. Some even believed that Emperor Elmesia wouldn’t interfere with politics at all, emboldening them to the point that they would try to exploit opportunities in an attempt to amass power for their own house.</p>
<p id="line_1106">As a countermeasure, it was one of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s duties as Duke to keep a watchful eye on them. It was precisely because of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s position that he needed to act cautiously regarding this current situation.</p>
<p id="line_1107">A leisurely tour abroad may not have been a problem, but this was the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> kingdom he was going to. He feared there may be some individuals lying in wait, ready to use anything as leverage in order to take him down. Other than that, there wasn’t much that was likely to happen. However, there was no way to rule out any devious assassination attempts on the Emperor. Before they could even set off, thorough preparations were an absolute requirement in order to prevent such a catastrophe from ever unfolding.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1108">“You are worrying too much, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-chan.”</p>

<p id="line_1115">“—What do you mean?”</p>
<p id="line_1116">Of course he’s a force to be reckoned with.

<p id="line_1134">“Sure, it will be hard to explore that forest. To this day we haven’t done so because there is no benefit in doing that,” Elmesia began to elaborate upon her thoughts, attempting to enlighten <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

The difficulties of doing so were numerous, yet there would be little meaning to constructing such a road.</p>
<p id="line_1135">However, that situation has changed.</p>
<p id="line_1136">For the longest time, all roads from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> have led to one single distant nation, the Dwarven Kingdom—the Armed Nation of Dwargon. Yet now that there was a newly emerging kingdom in the Jura Great Forest—the road would lead to Jura Tempest Federation. Naturally, the purpose for constructing roads was trade. Before, technological exchange with the dwarves would certainly help boost the nations technological advancements. But in the end, it was just not worth the effort of having to accomplish such a colossal task. With that being said, the previous order had been entirely disrupted now that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> appeared.</p>

He understood what Elmesia was trying to get at. Though that was the case, he didn’t perceive any severe error in his judgement.</p>
<p id="line_1139">Suddenly he was overcome with a striking realization. As Elmesia had pointed out, there hadn’t been any benefit before, yet now that land within the Jura Great Forest was creating an infinite amount of value.

<p id="line_1141">“My judgement was made considering that the construction work will inevitably require him to invest both funds and armed forces, it is probably more ideal to just pay the tolls and reap the benefits,” was the deduction that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> made, in order to justify his agreement to the plan.</p>

<p id="line_1143">“You have a point. Given any normal circumstances, that would indeed have been the right decision to make, with minimal cost to our own nation.

He was a highly renowned merchant and had the ability to assess the nature of any man after just one look in their eyes. Some came here to borrow money or discuss new business opportunities, and occasionally a few nobles that had fallen on hard times would come to discuss suspicious trades. It was annoying to deal with those idiots, but sometimes they did indeed bring profitable business. That’s why he couldn’t hand such critical work to others.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1168">He finished dealing with a conman-looking fellow while concerned about that and called in the next guest.</p>

That’s why his job was challenging this time.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_1174">This man—Viscount Kazak—wished to open a new shop with his slaves, so he came to loan some money from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

A business wouldn’t be turning a profit just because you bought some cute female slaves. It was of great importance to analyze the market and the target customers as well. It was also obligatory to find a decent location to open the shop as well as deciding on payment for the girls. However, giving such advice to him would amount to nothing more than “casting pearls before swine”<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The JP source is “马の耳に念仏” (Chanting scripture before a horse’s ears)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1176">“Huh? It’s your job to find the place. And asking me to pay those girls?

<p id="line_1177">Even if forcing the slaves to work without pay was the whole point, you had to provide them with food regardless. Then there was also the clothing for them to wear and residences for them to live in that must all be planned out beforehand. The point is that buying slaves would inevitably mean a huge long-term investment. The beautiful slaves he wished to find as an eye-catching attraction could only be found among high-quality slaves whose prices were exorbitant enough to buy entire estates. Rather than having these people run the shop, he’d be better off recruiting average workers. A good example would be the shop opened with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s investment in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. No matter how beautiful the woman may be, she would unavoidably age in the end. The money earned through them would hardly be sufficient to recover the initial investments.

<p class="space-break" id="line_1178">If he were trying to increase the profit rate by also providing sexual services, it could cause the spread of disease in the region if appropriate preparations were not made.

<p id="line_1182">“Oh, about that. I’ll let you in on something, I’ve got ways around things, so if you are willing to invest, I may just tell you. But surely you get what I mean, this is some top-secret information… All I can say is that those slaves are all elves,” Viscount Kazak said with an entirely serious expression.</p>

Through sheer willpower alone did he manage to maintain his composure. He was a famous merchant after all, so he couldn’t just show his dislike of others on his face. The type of merchant to do that couldn’t even qualify as third-class; they were a rookie who would never make their business big. Compared to that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was more intrigued by the elven slaves mentioned by Viscount Kazak.

Since he was the head of a syndicate, he wouldn’t shy away from illicit affairs. However, he would still know where to stop before things got out of hand. It didn’t mean he should be forgiven just because of that, but he still didn’t wish to cross that line of extreme evil. This was how he instructed his subordinates to handle things as well. Precisely because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was intensely familiar with shady deals, he couldn’t ignore the grave danger that came with buying elven slaves.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1186"><em>Did he just say elves? Those things are definitely related to a large criminal syndicate!</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1187">Elves were a species of longevity, most of them blessed with a beautiful appearance, high intelligence, and most of them were even talented in magic as well.

<p id="line_1245">Oh, so that perverted guy was a nobleman?</p>
<p id="line_1246">Now that I was able to completely suppress my aura, I could show my face directly when visiting human towns. It was rather convenient since I broke my mask again the day I became a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and hadn’t gotten around to fixing it yet. That’s why as soon as that mister saw my face, he must have mistaken me for a young girl. But I wouldn’t lash out over such minor things. Unlike Veldora or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I knew how to read the situation. I kept an extra eye out having noticed how arrogantly he was acting; it seemed that was the right call. Speaking of which, since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> cut ties with him, maybe I didn’t really need to worry so much.</p>
<p id="line_1247">“That noble promised to set out for revenge, isn’t that kind of bad?”</p>
<p id="line_1248">“Indeed, considering that man called Kazak is hard to deal with. Speaking of his proposal this time, he is trying to use slaves, even elven ones…”</p>
<p id="line_1249">“Elves?” I asked out of surprise.</p>
<p id="line_1250">Speaking of elves, there were many of them at that nightclub in the Dwarven Kingdom. I also heard that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had an elven bloodline, but they were not considered to be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, rather demi-humans.

<p id="line_1251">“Wouldn’t that make him—”</p>
<p id="line_1252">“Yes. It would be a crime. That man planned to make me an accomplice. Although I’ve done some bad things in the past, I’ve not been stupid enough to capture and enslave elves.”</p>
<p id="line_1253">“So it is indeed criminal. What would happen if it gets exposed?”</p>
<p id="line_1254">“That is hard to determine. Despite how the man looked, Kazak is still given the rank of Viscount. Blumund is a small kingdom, so there aren’t that many noblemen. Even suckers like him have considerable authority.”</p>
<p id="line_1255">I couldn’t believe that man just now was a Viscount. Well it was no wonder that he would call me rude, but if that were the case, he would be a higher-ranked nobleman than Fuze’s friend Baron Veryard.

<p id="line_1272">The date of the event had been officially decided.

<p id="line_1273">Right now Rigurd and his men were working intensively and sending out invitations to the leaders of the world.</p>
<p id="line_1274">In addition, Rigurd’s men were not the only ones working hard.

Moreover, she was working tirelessly to create colorful cakes in an effort to open up a cafe of her very own in my nation. I’d also introduced the renowned pastry chef Yoshida-san from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who took care of me back then, to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It was a futile effort to try and convince Yoshida-san to open a store in Tempest.

Her hands folded beautifully as she bowed, the elegance of her movements was mesmerizing.</p>
<p id="line_1279">Yoshida-san tried to play cool on the surface, yet he was totally wrecked on the inside. It looked like we were about to finally win him over…</p>
<p id="line_1280">“—Uh. There is no chance you can beat me with seduction. If you truly wish for me to move no matter what, then show me how excellent your ability to cook is! If you can make dishes that would satisfy me, I may just reconsider things.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1281">Due to Yoshida-san’s proposal, the whole thing turned into a culinary showdown somehow.

<p id="line_1283">“Yes, I understand!”</p>
<p id="line_1284">“Oi oi oi, master, who is supposed to be this “arrogant cafe owner” now…” Yoshida-san complained to me, which I ignored completely.</p>
<p id="line_1285"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was highly motivated. Yoshida-san’s art of cooking ignited her fighting spirit. She used the kitchen to prepare dishes beyond simply “delicious.” The dish was—Tamagoyaki<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Or Tamago (玉子焼き), Japanese style rolled fried egg, the phrase used in the passage is “卵焼き”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>.</p>
<p id="line_1286">This was the ultimate delicacy that is rumored to show a chef’s skill from its making alone.</p>
<p id="line_1287">Yoshida-san gulped as he saw her serving the dish. He then began to use a fork to silently place the tamagoyaki inside his mouth.</p>
<p id="line_1288">“Delicious!!”</p>
<p id="line_1289">Instant KO.</p>
<p id="line_1290">After having a taste of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s overwhelming culinary skill, Yoshida-san finally recognized her.</p>
<p id="line_1291">“Thank you.”</p>
<p id="line_1292">A smile emerged on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s face. That became the fatal blow. Her smile dove straight into his heart, to which Yoshida-san had completely fallen for.</p>
<p id="line_1293">“Tsk, it can’t be helped then! This is my special treatment for you!” the brawny man promised <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with an awkward smile.

Since he was making an effort to play it cool, it would’ve been quite pitiful had I pointed it out.</p>
<p id="line_1294">And so, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Yoshida-san became good partners. Our business would definitely be going through the roof. I had a feeling that they would become the center of attention.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1295">There was also <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He seemed to have been collaborating with Vesta in hosting a presentation reviewing the history of the healing potion. They didn’t intend to publicize any core technologies and their intentions seemed to be focused on attracting people who were interested and would volunteer to participate in their research plans.

<p id="line_1296">It was no exception for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the eldest of the three dwarven brothers, Garm.

<p class="space-break" id="line_1298">I heard that the two pairs would be displaying their exhibits next to each other and compete on the grounds of who could attract more guests. It was wonderful to see that they were having fun with their friendly rivalry during the festival.</p>

<p id="line_1300">As for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I told him to take a vacation, so the construction work would probably be put on hold for now.</p>
<p id="line_1301">I also told him to give a vacation for the captives as well, so they would probably be hosting a feast on that day too.</p>
<p id="line_1302">Inevitably some people had to work during the holidays, so we made special arrangements to have them rotate so that they didn’t have to work the entire time. The feast was planned to last for around a week, so I hoped everyone could have fun.</p>
<p id="line_1303">Speaking of which, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wasn’t falling behind either, she seemed to be planning something as well.</p>

<p id="line_1306">In addition, it was the same for Veldora—he had made some bold declaration again. I gotta think of a way to resolve it before he gives anyone around him any trouble…</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1307">Given what my companions were up to, I figured I had to do something as well.

<p id="line_1321">“Hehehe, it’s already been resolved.

<p id="line_1323">“Rules! Yep, I mean Rules. We believe it was necessary to have a charter of rules and negotiated with their party. So everyone has made peace with each other.”</p>

<p id="line_1331">Since I wasn’t even sure whether she would come or not, there’s no point in worrying about this type of people. I decided to discuss more seriously about the things I intended to push forward.</p>

<p id="line_1341">“All right! Let’s put that in the menu as well. By the way, are there enough people?”</p>
<p id="line_1342">“About that, right now I can imagine a scale of around twenty shops.

<p id="line_1343">As expected of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he really got my idea and didn’t even spare any expense on training talent.

<p id="line_1370">Veldora’s stubborn tantrums were nothing new at this point, but there were important figures from various nations attending the festival this time. It would be embarrassing if any of them got food poisoning during the event, so I had to assign verifiable supervision and have people watch over him in order to be reassured. On the one hand it would be too pitiful to reject him without reason, but on the other hand it would be terribly nerve-wracking to let him handle everything by himself. All things considered, I was quite lucky that the people found by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had already been trained.</p>

<p id="line_1384">Picking up on how <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> reacted, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began to explain with joy.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1385">The content was as follows—</p>
<p id="line_1386">Many high-grade inns were built in Tempest Federation, which <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had already checked into before so he was quite familiar with them.</p>
<p id="line_1387">You would find all sorts of facilities for overnight accommodation in those places while experiencing a variety of different themes. There were inns where you could enjoy a beautiful garden scenery and meals at the same time, while others might offer open-air hot springs as well.</p>
<p id="line_1388">It may be different for large nations, but in smaller nations, even noblemen would find it challenging to sustain a personal bathing pool. For nations without a tap water system, filling the bathtub to boil water alone was a difficult task.

If an entry fee weren’t required, peasants during slack season would probably join the fun. As the news spread through these people, average citizens from nearby countries would get interested as well. The point is, if the population of people flowing in exceeded tens of thousands, the inns in the streets would no doubt make a lot of money.

I’d collaborated with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the past as well making money in secret, so I looked forward to grabbing tons of cash in bigger actions.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1544"><em>Just kidding, there’s plenty of that in our nation’s treasury! But all the money has been taken by me and not distributed as salary to my subordinates.

I would definitely feel bad afterwards. All in all, I thought that money should be spent on national development. However, we still needed money. Not that I was personally interested, but because I had to bring that brat <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to the Night Butterfly again. Veldora was also arguing that he wanted to come along, which was super annoying. Visiting that type of store would cost some money one way or another.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1546">I was (definitely) not personally interested, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Veldora were really giving me headaches. This amount was nothing compared to the national treasury, but if it were just my pocket money, the expense would be so ridiculous that I’d be spending it all in one place. Moreover, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> always got my pocket money for me, but as soon as she heard the location I had visited she would confiscate my wallet immediately… Under those circumstances, how could I even dare to ask, “Isn’t the money from the treasury my money anyway?”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1547">That’s why I was working on side-projects to earn pocket money so that there would be no such concern in the future. I even ended up with the intriguing plan to host a martial tournament. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> truly had an outstanding talent. I had no idea how he interpreted my words, but his enthusiasm for planning exceeded my imagination.</p>
<p id="line_1548">Attracting crowds by hosting a martial tournament was his idea, and he also quickly came up with the plan to introduce merchandise as well as selling healing potions and equipment. He was indeed a visionary. These were amazing pitches.</p>
<p id="line_1549">After I returned, I needed to tell everyone to construct a colosseum fast. While <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was helping the Beast Kingdom rebuild their city, Mildo would need to assist him as well. With the two persons in charge of the construction department abroad, I had practically become the one in charge.</p>
<p id="line_1550">But that’s totally fine. It was probably due to the continuous construction projects that our nation had gradually given birth to new engineering talents. That’s why nowadays all I needed to do was ask, without any need to do heavy work. There was a craftsman<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The term is 職人, which means craftsman/worker, in this case the role is similar to “engineer”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> called of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who was Mildo’s disciple. Now he had become a pillar of the town’s construction industry. If it were him, surely, he would be able to build a gorgeous-looking colosseum.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1551">Under normal circumstances, such a project would take up to a dozen years, but with the strength of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the time can be reduced tremendously. With that being said, the time left before the festival was just barely more than two months. The remaining time available was insufficient, it would be impossible to complete all of the buildings. So we should just lay out the stages this time.</p>
<p id="line_1552">As for the design—</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1553">«Answer.

Construction of blueprint based on this information… Successful.»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1554">—Just like that, easy peasy.</p>
<p id="line_1555">There was still some paper left, so I started to sketch and add up my ideas on it. Normally speaking, it would take at least a couple of months to reach this level of design. Field measurement, calculation of construction intensity etc. What made it worse was that the time taken for these operations alone would be using the base unit of year, which would be more than common.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Fuse works in the construction business, probably speaking from experience." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> In addition, the design graph of it was supposed to be sketched in a computer for a few days, but now all I needed to do was draw it out by hand… The support of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei on such details had also been boosted in efficiency. Although I still felt that this was somewhat beyond common sense—that is but my belated comment, I should have more of an open mind.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1556">Next, the design graph was done all right, but I still needed to discuss with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_1557">I should first hand the design graph to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. When he has spare time, he can gather and lead the workers to the construction site.</p>
<p id="line_1558">Then, let’s deliver the message.</p>
<p id="line_1559">“Ranga, are you there?”</p>
<p id="line_1560">“Yes, my master!”</p>
<p id="line_1561">I summoned Ranga. He stuck his head out from my shadow and responded.</p>
<p id="line_1562">Since the plan to conquer the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had been settled for a while, everyone except <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had returned. But Ranga seemed to have taken my shadow as his designated personal seat and immediately went into it.</p>
<p id="line_1563">I handed the sketched design graph of the colosseum to Ranga.</p>
<p id="line_1564">“Hand this to a craftsman in the town by the name of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. By the way, could you help me by asking whether they have time to gather at the west gate?”</p>
<p id="line_1565">“Understood. Speaking of which, isn’t <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama returning as well?”</p>
<p id="line_1566">“No. Since I’ve come all the way here, I want to visit Fuze first before returning.”</p>
<p id="line_1567">“If that’s the case, shouldn’t you need a bodyguard to accompany you?”</p>
<p id="line_1568">Knowing that I was not returning yet, Ranga seemed quite anxious. I saw that his tail was hanging low, but you need not worry that much. Despite how I look, I’m still a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> after all. At the moment I wasn’t getting careless and had ‘Absolute Defense’ running. If I actually ran into an attack strong enough to break it, wouldn’t it be unsafe for me wherever I go? What Ranga was doing is called being paranoid.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1569">“There’s not gonna be any problem. I’ll just be going to have a little chat with him. If anyone should warrant any worries, it would be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He seems to have become a target of some strange nobleman. There’s no way of knowing what that type of person would do.”</p>
<p id="line_1570">“Oh, are you referring to that vulgar man from before? Should I go and bite him to death?”</p>
<p id="line_1571">STOPUUU. <em>Don’t do that kind of thing in towns of other kingdoms. It’s gonna cause huge problems.</em></p>
<p id="line_1572">“Geez, you must have gotten so aggressive because of spending all that time with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I think you’d better relearn some normal values.”</p>
<p id="line_1573">“H-How so!”</p>
<p id="line_1574">Ranga was shocked at my comment. He wasn’t self-aware at all.</p>
<p id="line_1575">“During your last battle, did you really adhere to my orders? Have you really not overdone things?”</p>
<p id="line_1576">“T-There’s no such thing, master—”</p>
<p id="line_1577">Ranga seemed kind of shaken, could it be…</p>
<p id="line_1578">The only things reported back by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was as follows—“N-No problem at all!,” “R-Right. We were lucky to have Ranga-san there, he was really reliable!”</p>
<p id="line_1579">I felt something was suspicious but did not ask for details. I had a feeling that it would’ve just given me a headache if I had asked. Therefore, I left those matters for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to take care of and, since that guy hasn’t complained about anything, I’ll just pretend everything was fine. <s>(<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grigori" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>: It was not okay)</s></p>
<p id="line_1580">This is what people call running away from problems. But, if there really was any problem, someone should have already reported to me, so I just chose to believe them. I hoped Ranga could be more cautious in the future to stay away from getting poisoned by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>(’s mind).</p>
<p id="line_1581">“Ranga-kun? Do it as a favor for me, please don’t act too reckless!”</p>
<p id="line_1582">I caressed Ranga’s neck and gave him those words of caution.</p>
<p id="line_1583">“I understand—”</p>
<p id="line_1584">Ranga nodded obediently in response, concluding this ordeal.</p>
<p id="line_1585">“All right. Next, I hope you can deliver the message. One more thing, by the way, if there are any people available from the security department, send them to protect <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Please confirm the matter for me as well!”</p>
<p id="line_1586">“Understood!”</p>
<p id="line_1587">With that being said, Ranga once again snuck into my shadow and set on his way to return home.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1588">I decided at last to send a guard to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s side. They would be protecting him from the shadows without being noticed. Although I wasn’t sure who they would send, but there were very few individuals in the security department who could operate on their own. It’s safe to say it wouldn’t be any rookie, the person coming would at least be a seasoned veteran at the rank of squad leader.</p>
<p id="line_1589">The squad leader is the team leader of a five-man squad. In terms of ranking for adventurers that equates to Rank B, tasking them as a bodyguard should not pose any challenge. During my stay in this town, I needed to get hold of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s trace so that I would be informed if he encountered any dicey situations. Before the guard arrived, I went to go see Fuze first.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1590">I opened the gate to the building of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> branch in Blumund and entered. I accidentally went overboard last time, which made me concerned about whether I would cause a commotion… But only a sight of “Who are you?” greeted me. Since the person didn’t say anything, I successfully made my way to the counter.</p>
<p id="line_1591">Oh right, I came in last time with that mask, so there was no way they would know who I was.</p>
<p id="line_1592">Never mind, this is fine. If they weren’t willing to help me contact Fuze, I’d just drop the invitation and leave. With that relaxed outlook on my mind, I walked towards the counter.</p>
<p id="line_1593">“Heyo. My name is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Could you help slide a message for the branch leader Fuze-san? Ah, take this, it’s my identity card.”</p>
<p id="line_1594">As I finished, I took out my identification card from my ‘Stomach’ and showed the reception lady.</p>
<p id="line_1595"><em>How is such a young girl an adventurer?</em> Usually I didn’t mind hearing this. All I felt was “<s>Ah shit,</s> here we go again.”</p>
<p id="line_1596">I’d long gotten used to it by now, but luckily the reception lady still remembered me. She blushed and gazed at me mesmerized.</p>

<p id="line_1600">“Ah, right. I wanted to go through the Rank A test, but I’ve been busy lately.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1601">Actually, I just felt it was too troublesome. Since I’d already ranked up above Rank B, my access increased with it, and with it came more responsibility. I already felt there to be too much trouble at B-plus, but I’d go for a higher rank when there was the need.</p>
<p id="line_1602">I wasn’t doing it for the salary anyway, yet I still had to move out when crisis emerges. But in return, I got to access all the nations conveniently and I also didn’t need to pay resting and dining at different branches. To be honest, it was indeed delightful to have so much convenience covered in so many areas, but it would be really troublesome to have restraints put on me by others. But I didn’t need to say such a thing to shatter everyone’s dream.</p>

<p id="line_1609">I should just stay away from the adventurer career. I’ll wait until whenever I am forced to move out as an adventurer to use my “Rename System.” It seemed that for me I could move out when lowered to Rank B, that should be enough.

We only shared the same name; it was fortunate that no one appeared to realize that I was the actual <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1623">Perhaps the name “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>” wasn’t that rare after all. <s>(Veldora: Am I a joke to you? Everyone: Yes!)</s> As I thought so, I walked towards the room Fuze was waiting in.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1624">I entered the room casually. Upon seeing me, Fuze was holding his head. I didn’t give much thought to it and greeted Fuze.</p>
<p id="line_1625">“Heya! I’ve come to play. What’s wrong with you, did something happen? What’s that distressed look on your face?”</p>
<p id="line_1626">“Uh… Everything was so peaceful up until just now, but a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> suddenly showed up…”</p>
<p id="line_1627">“Eh? Really? That would be terrible. Aren’t you being too casual?”</p>
<p id="line_1628">“No no no, that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is right in front of me. Now then, what should I do…?”</p>
<p id="line_1629">“Eh, is that so? Hmm, I suppose you should serve him a cup of tea? And if there is any cake or food like that around, I think the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be pretty pleased to eat them too!”</p>
<p id="line_1630">“What cake! Do you think it is that easy to get luxurious food like that! Seriously, why does <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, even after becoming a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, enjoy coming and going wherever you please?”</p>
<p id="line_1631">While complaining, Fuze didn’t forget to prepare tea for me. You can’t judge a book by its cover, he was a serious man.</p>
<p id="line_1632">I said my thanks as I took that cup of tea. With a sip down my throat, we began to discuss business.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1633">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, I’m really sorry this time. We weren’t able to successfully stop the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> which led to the march of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight Order" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>…”</p>
<p id="line_1634">“Ah, that really couldn’t be helped. The masterminds seemed to have been the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Seven Luminary Clerics" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”’</p>
<p id="line_1635">“Really?”</p>
<p id="line_1636">“So no matter how hard we have emphasized that the people of my nation are harmless, they would probably not listen.”</p>
<p id="line_1637">“It’s the ‘Seven Celestial’…? Those people were the guardians of mankind, they were great heroes in the past—”</p>
<p id="line_1638">“So I heard. They had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in their sights too, so after a series of incidents, she is luckily still safe and sound and our misunderstanding was resolved along with it. But unfortunately, there was one casualty. One of the captains called <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Garde" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> went missing.”</p>
<p id="line_1639">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Garde" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of ‘Fire’—Although he was not as good as Shizue-san, he was still talented in launching elegant spear moves combined with the magic of fire spirits. That man was one of the Ten Great Saints who are the protectors of mankind…” Fuze muttered regretfully.</p>
<p id="line_1640">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Garde" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> I saw was an illusion created as a disguise by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Seven Luminaries" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, so I wasn’t able to meet him in person and had no idea what type of person he really was. But since he appeared to be quite famous, Fuze would naturally know given how well-informed he always was.</p>
<p id="line_1641">While I said that he had gone missing, I suspected he had probably been murdered. I felt really sorry for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Garde" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, but all I could say now was “rest in peace…”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1642">I then recounted the events up until today. Just now Fuze had been worried about me, so I also told him about the Walpurgis Banquet. I mentioned that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s had been reduced to eight people and their name changed to “Octagram.” I also told him about my conflict with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and how the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Seven Luminaries" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> died. Mindful of my promise, I vaguely brushed over the part about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s true identity. Although people may say that my lips were never sealed tightly enough, I was not thick-headed enough to have revealed such an important secret.</p>
<p id="line_1643">“I see how it was… No matter how we had approached or tried to contact them, it would have all been obstructed on the outset. I even sent people to the Church headquarters after communication with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> branch failed. But I couldn’t get in contact with anyone higher than the rank of priest… I never imagined that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Seven Luminaries" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would have been plotting behind the scene.”</p>
<p id="line_1644">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said so too. But, their faith towards Ru—correction, the God <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was true, that seemed to have also been confirmed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_1645">“Humans are too fragile, that’s why we want to rely on the power of god—”</p>
<p id="line_1646">“Does Fuze do that too?”</p>
<p id="line_1647">“Haha, I’m not like them. When I run out of my last breath, it would be the end of me. I’ve lived all my life with that resolved in mind. Although I do pray for miracles, I do not pray to any ‘God’ that I’ve never met.”</p>
<p id="line_1648">I see, so Fuze was an atheist. In this world, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with supernatural strength were often worshipped as earth deities to be respected by man. But they would only do so after meeting said beings. It was no exception for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>: in the beginning she seemed only interested in protecting individuals that she had known well. Fuze had never met such a god before, that’s why he relied on his own strength. It may sound very pragmatic, but it was easy to understand.</p>
<p id="line_1649">“I can indeed understand how people feel the need to pray to god. But in reality, what god is capable of doing is probably only within their own abilities. To put aside God <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it is sufficient to say that the incident has brought us and the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> together in peace.”</p>
<p id="line_1650">It was precisely because I knew the true identity of the God <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that I knew praying was a meaningless action. But at the end of the day, it is but empty talk. Sometimes prayer alone would bring people strength, it is not something I could just simply rebuke.</p>
<p id="line_1651">“That’s right. I personally feel as if a huge burden has been taken off my shoulders.”</p>
<p id="line_1652">Fuze smiled as he finished. He seemed to be quite troubled by achieving pitifully little while struggling to persuade the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in accordance with our deal. Seeing how much he cared sparked joy within me.</p>
<p id="line_1653">I’d talked from start to finish about all of the events as we chatted. I rose up as I brought the conversation to a close, but suddenly recalled something.</p>
<p id="line_1654">“Then it is about time for me to leave, here’s something for you.”</p>
<p id="line_1655">I took out an envelope from my pocket and handed it to Fuze. The envelope contained the invitation for the Kingdom-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that was planned to be hosted in my nation. I almost forgot about it during the intense exchange. This was my purpose of visiting today after all.</p>
<p id="line_1656">“And this is?”</p>
<p id="line_1657">“We are hosting a celebration for the presentation announcing my inauguration as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Being titled a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, we plan to have some fun. I’ve also sent out invitations to the royalties and noble in the neighboring nations, Fuze, you’ve got to attend it as well.”</p>
<p id="line_1658">“Huh? Hold on, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. Even if I attend—”</p>
<p id="line_1659">“It’s all right. We have an invitation for the king of Blumund as well, so help me deliver it along the way.”</p>
<p id="line_1660">“Why don’t you just directly—Ah, is it not convenient…”</p>
<p id="line_1661">“Indeed. I have people directly sending the invitations to the Dwarven King and Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s side, but I’m not familiar with the people in other nations. A <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> running directly towards them may cause a commotion, so I’ve had people send them to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> branches in their respective kingdoms. I did meet the king of Blumund once, but is it really okay for a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to go there in person?” I said with a smile, Fuze grasped the invitation with a wry smile, “Things are already bad enough when a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> comes here.”</p>
<p id="line_1662">“I’ve now indeed got the invitation. I’ll make sure to hand it over to the king,” Fuze changed his expression and made his promise.</p>
<p id="line_1663">Now that my business was done, I did plan to leave for real now, but this time I was interrupted by Fuze suddenly speaking up upon recalling something, “By the way, the head of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has been worried about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san as well. He was drained during the negotiation with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I’ll inform him later that the problem has been successfully resolved.”</p>
<p id="line_1664">So <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had been worried about me. A lot had happened since I last met that guy. I got a nostalgic feeling.</p>
<p id="line_1665">“I see, it seems I’ve given <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> some unnecessary trouble.”</p>
<p id="line_1666">“It’s not unnecessary. Honestly, the Association doesn’t wish to antagonize the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, so he judged that it would be most ideal to find a way to peacefully negotiate.”</p>
<p id="line_1667">Fuze told me not to worry. But I kinda wanted to give something to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in return—</p>
<p id="line_1668">“Speaking of! Let me invite <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> along. Or would it cause some problems?”</p>
<p id="line_1669">“About that, I’m not exactly sure. Although I’m not qualified to say so, he is still quite the busy man. I’m not sure if he can find the spare hours…”</p>
<p id="line_1670">“I’ll cover his transportation for coming and leaving, is it possible for him to have one day off? If he can’t then I won’t push it, I’ll just go play with him later. That’s all, please help me deliver this to him as well.”</p>
<p id="line_1671">As I finished, I started to write a letter in front of Fuze and put it into the envelope along with the invitation. I handed it over to the shocked Fuze.</p>
<p id="line_1672">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, where did that paper come from… Uh, never mind. Besides, if it’s only a letter I can do the favor utilizing the magic of ‘Teleportation’…”</p>
<p id="line_1673">Fuze seemed exhausted. I may be a little bit too casual with asking people for favors.</p>
<p id="line_1674">“Ahaha, sorry. Then, I’ll be counting on you.”</p>
<p id="line_1675">“I understand, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.”</p>

<p id="line_1677">As I confirmed Fuze had taken the envelope, I delivered such an astonishing statement.</p>
<p id="line_1678">“Milim? Ehh, do you mean…”</p>
<p id="line_1679">“I’ll be leaving first then, that’s just how it is!”</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1683">After leaving the location of the association branch, a man jumped out of my shadow to greet me while kneeling.</p>

<p class="no-indent" id="line_1706">The location was a small, slightly disorganized conference room. Within stood two suspicious shadows.</p>
<p id="line_1707">No, that’s not all. There was also the shadow of a smaller person. It was around thirty centimeters tall and possessed wings similar to those of a dragonfly. With this tiny person’s shadow at the center, the other two sat opposite to each other.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1708">It was Ramiris and her two servants—Beretta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1709"><em>Doooong!</em> With an imposing aura, Ramiris struck the mini-table in front of her.</p>
<p id="line_1710">Then, she shared her feelings to her two trusted subordinates.</p>
<p id="line_1711">“This isn’t gonna work! We have to move away!”</p>
<p id="line_1712">Maybe she hit it a bit too hard, she rubbed her hand in pain.</p>
<p id="line_1713">While looking at Ramiris gently, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said:</p>
<p id="line_1714">“As expected of Ramiris-sama. What a great idea!”</p>
<p id="line_1715">“Right? Right?”</p>
<p id="line_1716">Ramiris nodded in satisfaction and responded to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_1717">The person who spoke up to persuade them is the other person—Beretta.</p>
<p id="line_1718">“One moment please. Putting aside whether or not this is a good idea, where are you planning to move to? And could you share the reason?”</p>
<p id="line_1719"><em>Why do I have to be that guy</em>—Beretta thought anxiously.</p>
<p id="line_1720">Speaking of his colleague <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, she was kind and attentive, a very capable woman. The spirits also really liked her, all of Ramiris’s labyrinth was under her management. These were abilities Beretta did not possess. She was undoubtedly, to Ramiris and himself, a useful talent.</p>
<p id="line_1721">However, there was still a problem with her. That being, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was absolutely spoiling her master, Ramiris. She agreed to Ramiris no matter what she said without even a single shred of doubt. That’s why, before things got problematic, someone had to intervene.</p>
<p id="line_1722"><em>I can’t stand it. I didn’t follow Ramiris-sama to be that type of character, always the guy to intervene…</em> Ex-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-Clan member Beretta mocked himself.</p>
<p id="line_1723">Beretta really liked Ramiris and he didn’t feel any pain even after being toyed around by her. But his colleague that stood together with him not only didn’t advise Ramiris, but even blindly spoiled her in her palm, which was hard for him to accept.</p>
<p id="line_1724">Unfortunately…</p>
<p id="line_1725">That was the true nature of this world, the serious people tended to suffer losses.</p>
<p id="line_1726"><em>This will be bad if it continues—whoever stands up to hit the brake will also be responsible for cleaning up the mess.</em></p>
<p id="line_1727">As such, Beretta would be playing the unfavorable role today…</p>
<p id="line_1728">“That is a great question! Isn’t it super boring living here, Beretta-chan? There is nothing fun to do unless you count making golems perhaps. There aren’t many visitors normally anyway! But there is a lot of fun stuff over there. That’s why we should go there and have fun. That’s how it is!” Ramiris stressed energetically.</p>
<p id="line_1729">Hearing this, Beretta sighed inwardly, thinking “That’s just what I expected.”</p>
<p id="line_1730">Beretta had no direct reason to object to Ramiris’s suggestion. The only thing was, based on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s personality, he didn’t think the man would easily agree to it. Even if she wanted to move directly to there, it was possible that she would eventually get kicked out. Reasonably speaking, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> should’ve also understood this, but as his colleague, she kept on caving to Ramiris. This forced Beretta to take a stand.</p>
<p id="line_1731">“But Ramiris-sama, hasn’t <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama already rejected this plan?”</p>
<p id="line_1732">Indeed, she had been rejected once already. That’s why without a proper reason, it may displease <em>him</em>.</p>
<p id="line_1733">Ramiris may not have been so self-aware, it was, however, a huge problem to Beretta.</p>
<p id="line_1734">“Beretta, you are overcomplicating things. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama is a good and kind-hearted person. If someone as cute as Ramiris-sama makes a request, how could he possibly refuse her so ruthlessly?”</p>
<p id="line_1735">Beretta’s useless colleague just liked to make such optimistic claims all day. She was extremely calculating and capable of encountering anything unrelated to Ramiris, yet right now she really couldn’t be relied upon. That’s why Beretta had to think on behalf of the two airheads to come up with the right plan. After all, Beretta also wished to move closer to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1736"><em>Because of that, even in such a ridiculous situation, I can still find joy in it…</em></p>
<p id="line_1737">Beretta thought to himself. The face hidden behind his mask was smiling cheerfully.</p>

<p id="line_1739">I had been using ‘Spatial Domination’ to travel, as it could teleport me instantly to anywhere I’d been before. Its magicule consumption was quite large, but it was a negligible portion of my total magicule storage. So it shouldn’t pose a problem, and I could use it however many times I wanted, given how convenient it was for traveling. With that being said, it would suck if I entered stasis from overusing it. That’s why I put some restraints on its usage.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1740">By the way, as soon as I returned to town, Ranga contacted me with ‘Telepathy Net.’</p>

<p id="line_1742">Ranga paused upon saying this.</p>
<p id="line_1743"><em>What happened?</em></p>
<p id="line_1744">Feeling somewhat uneasy, I walked towards the West gate.</p>
<p id="line_1745">Despite just talking about exercising restraint, I used ‘Spatial Domination’ to instantly teleport.</p>
<p id="line_1746">Then, I applied ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Universal Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ to sense the wide area beyond my visual senses to catch on to the location of Ranga. Next, I could easily activate ‘Spatial Domination’ as long as it was within my visible range. It’s a lot like exchanging coordinates.</p>
<p id="line_1747"><em>It was really convenient, but it should be pretty difficult to use it for combat. The activation requires some time, during which I fear that I would be wide open. It really depends on how you use it, in normal days—Uh, I gotta restrain myself.</em></p>

<p id="line_1774">At my urging, Beretta gave up his struggle and began to explain. According to him, all of this started because of a speech given by Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_1775">“B-Beretta! You traitor—!” Ramiris escaped from my hand and shouted, but I ignored her to listen to his story.</p>
<p id="line_1776">He said Ramiris wanted to move to our town no matter what, to which <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san also agreed. I glanced towards <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s direction and saw that her eyes were downcast in embarrassment.</p>
<p id="line_1777">Based on Beretta’s explanation, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was apparently spoiling Ramiris. This rings true given it was the same when they met before. And since that Beretta couldn’t object to the both of them, he was forced into this whole charade of forced house moving.</p>
<p id="line_1778">“But in fact it is just as Ramiris-sama has said, we’ve sealed the entry to the previous labyrinth and moved here.”</p>
<p id="line_1779">“That’s right! So <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. If you chase me from here, I’ll be homeless!” Ramiris said pitifully, but no matter how you put it she clearly had it coming. Also, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was saying: “How poor Ramiris-sama is.”</p>
<p id="line_1780"><em>Please stop spoiling the fairy.</em> But then again, now I understood the situation. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t start the quarrel.

<p id="line_1782">“There’s no need, we are fine. It did give the men guarding the gate some trouble though…”</p>
<p id="line_1783"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> turned to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gatekeeper who happened to be napping.</p>
<p id="line_1784">“—Oi.”</p>
<p id="line_1785">“T-There’s no such thing. I was just a bit too excited…”</p>
<p id="line_1786">“It is not Ramiris-sama’s fault! It was all because that gatekeeper said something mean to Ramiris-sama, so I used magic to put him to sleep for a bit.”</p>

What kind of farce was she playing… It seemed that she indeed used magic, apparently for Ramiris. Even Beretta seemed dumbfounded. I would listen to Ramiris and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san later. For now I needed Beretta to continue his explanation. However, he apparently already finished explaining the entire situation. He mentioned that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was preparing wood while Beretta was doing the assembling.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/illustrations/image5.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_1788"></p>
<p id="line_1789">The end product was the small wooden shack in front of me. It looked like they were planning to build a balcony next. Why build a shack? Apparently, it was for creating the new entrance to the labyrinth…</p>
<p id="line_1790">Speaking of this, Ramiris had mentioned something about wanting to move to this town. If all they were doing was setting up an entrance to Ramiris’s labyrinth, putting such a small shack here didn’t seem to pose a problem.</p>
<p id="line_1791">“So, you were trying to build the shack when the gatekeeper stopped you. And after you he interfered, you ordered <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san to put him to sleep. And in the end, you were discovered by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the other workers who came here, is that the case?”</p>
<p id="line_1792">“That…no, there’s no…such thing… I guess you can put it that way, but it’s not really the case…probably the case?”</p>
<p id="line_1793">“In other words, my guess was correct? Gees…”</p>
<p id="line_1794">“Aha, Ahahaha…”</p>
<p id="line_1795">Ramiris tried to laugh it off, but this was simply too reckless. This was my domain after all, even the other <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s had recognized it. What Ramiris was doing undoubtedly infringed on my territory. Normally, it wouldn’t be strange if an incident like this developed into open war.</p>
<p id="line_1796">But right now I had an idea. Seeing the small shack in front of me, I had a sudden burst of inspiration.</p>
<p id="line_1797">After doing a bit of outside the box thinking, it wouldn’t be so bad to let her create the labyrinth here. My conversation with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> from a few minutes ago echoed in my head. We needed to find a main event that would have people wanting to come back and see our nation again. That’s why we planned the opera house, the colosseum, and the health resort. But I was also been thinking about whether there could be other attractions. After all, doing the same thing all the time will eventually get stale.</p>
<p id="line_1798">Besides, martial tournaments couldn’t be held every day. At most we could hold four events in a year, considering it would be most appropriate to hold once per season. The same logic applied to horse racing. Content for ordinary folk to watch could be played every day, but these shows alone wouldn’t be able to attract the nobles who had grown a hard-to-satisfy appetite.</p>
<p id="line_1799">Considering this, our main customers would be average civilians and foreign adventurers. This town was designed with logistical flow in mind, so merchants would definitely be visiting, the adventurers acting as their guards in tow, so I hoped they would consider this as a base.</p>
<p id="line_1800">An adventurer had many jobs to do, one of them being eliminating <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. If I were to create a labyrinth here and fill it with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>… In this way, wouldn’t we be drawing a massive crowd every day?</p>
<p id="line_1801">Speaking of labyrinths, there was none that could top a dungeon. If we invited people to try and conquer the labyrinth, there may even be adventurers visiting for the sole purpose of exploration.</p>
<p id="line_1802"><em>Yes, this may actually work.</em></p>
<p id="line_1803">I turned to Ramiris who was looking up at me with an awkward smile. She was kinda… No, very unreliable, but this may just work. I’d made up my mind and decided to discuss my idea with Ramiris.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1804">I asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to direct the workers to dismantle the shack. But since the work was already in progress, we decided to change this place to a resting shack for the gatekeeper.</p>
<p id="line_1805">Next, we held a strategic meeting. With <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in tow, we went to the meeting room that was often used.</p>
<p id="line_1806">“Q-question please? How do you<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Ramiris is talking like a girl of low status from Japanese historical drama confronting some government official prosecuting her." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> plan to deal with the adorable folk girl and her companions?”</p>
<p id="line_1807">Probably due to being too nervous, Ramiris’s phrasing had become weird. It was probably because of her crisis senses. She kept on peeking at me.</p>
<p id="line_1808">“You don’t have to force yourself to act so courteously. Besides, not all of your words were as humble as you think, even the way you addressed yourself sounded weird.”</p>
<p id="line_1809">That’s why I hoped she could just use her normal tone to talk. I didn’t intend to do anything to Ramiris anyway. If she accepted my proposal, I was willing to overlook the whole charade put on by her. But before that, I needed to confirm a few things.</p>
<p id="line_1810">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I want to create an evacuation space under the colosseum, is it possible?”</p>
<p id="line_1811">“Even calculating based on the strength of an individual executive, the area under the stage is still not very safe. Once any hole is made, it may cause the entire stage to collapse. But it would be possible by shifting the position a little bit—”</p>
<p id="line_1812">“I see. I also wish to build a gate in that basement area.”</p>
<p id="line_1813">“…!”</p>
<p id="line_1814">“Building a gate?”</p>
<p id="line_1815">“Yes. Please make it thick and pave some stones to the walls to make it feel solid enough.”</p>
<p id="line_1816">“Will we be preparing evacuation space behind the gate too?”</p>
<p id="line_1817">“No, there’s no such need. The important thing is just the gate, right, Ramiris?”</p>
<p id="line_1818">“R-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>? Could it be, that you want to…”</p>
<p id="line_1819"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked confused while Ramiris on the other hand was filled with joy as she flapped her wings loudly.</p>
<p id="line_1820">I finally cracked a smile and nodded to Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_1821">Speaking of my proposal, it’s really nothing. I just wanted Ramiris to use her power to create and run a dungeon. Rather than building the entrance in some shack, we should prepare something more fitting and majestic. Since we’d defined it as basement level, it shouldn’t be a problem to build a colosseum on top of it.</p>
<p id="line_1822">The colosseum could provide amateur adventurers with lessons and instructions, and stores to sell healing potions were also expected to be set up. If we ran a dungeon like that, adventurers who were done with their business might grab a drink on their way home, so those stores and restaurants would also prosper along the way. Then I’d be able to grab money from the adventurers, and Ramiris would also have a place to live, not to mention a job. I would even give her pocket money. This idea required mutual cooperation, but it might just turn into something interesting.</p>
<p id="line_1823">Ramiris began to shout excitedly after hearing my words.</p>
<p id="line_1824">“Eh-EHEH! Could you be saying that you are giving me some amazing job on top of allowing us to create the labyrinth and live here?”</p>
<p id="line_1825">“If you accept my proposal, that would indeed be the case.”</p>
<p id="line_1826">“Eh? Then, then, do you mean that I have a chance to overcome this unbearable state of being a NEET—?”</p>
<p id="line_1827">She seemed downright shocked after hearing my plan. Ramiris’s eyes widened as if she’d been hit by lightning, even the way she spoke began to sound incoherent.</p>
<p id="line_1828"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san saw this with tears in her eyes and said: “This is wonderful, Ramiris-sama.” For some reason, I felt a smile on Beretta’s face. The exhausted look he gave before appeared to be an act, now he looked positively delighted.</p>
<p id="line_1829">Could it be that Beretta had hoped things would develop this way too?</p>
<p id="line_1830">It could be, or not. In any case, it’s fine as long as he was happy.</p>
<p id="line_1831">“Q-Question… Did you mean it when you said that you will give me pocket money?”</p>
<p id="line_1832">She seemed to have calmed down. Ramiris gulped and asked me prudently. She appeared to be afraid that I would respond with “Never mind that.”</p>
<p id="line_1833"><em>How would I say something like that, I’m not that mean, really! But depending on the amount of income, I can’t really promise you how much you are getting though… But that would at least reassure her a little bit.</em></p>
<p id="line_1834">“That’s real. The only thing is we won’t know how much profit we are getting until we try. Regardless, subtracting the necessary expenses such as promotional fees and venue rent, you get to keep two percent of remaining profits, what do you think?”</p>
<p id="line_1835">“B-Based on that, how much money would that be?”</p>
<p id="line_1836">“About that, if we assume a thousand or so adventurers visiting a day, your portion would be around two gold coins?”</p>
<p id="line_1837">“GUU! I-I get to earn that much money?!”</p>
<p id="line_1838">“Those are just estimates, whether it can be carried out successfully is still unknown. After all, there’s not much of a show to put on if there is no audience. That being said, since you are already settling in here, isn’t there no loss to you regardless?”</p>
<p id="line_1839">Ramiris nodded heavily in response to my question.</p>
<p id="line_1840">She came to live here without permission, and I knew, without her saying, that I’d be the one maintaining the labyrinth. If that is the case, she’d be better off just accepting my deal. After hearing my permission for her to live and make money, Ramiris had only one reaction, that was to hug onto my head and shout excitedly.</p>
<p id="line_1841">Since Ramiris had already accepted it, Beretta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san naturally would not object.</p>
<p id="line_1842">“Uhehe… Now I will become rich as well. Never again will I be looked down upon and get called the Jobless Broke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>
<p id="line_1843">As such, Ramiris had been mesmerized in her own world. I couldn’t help but laugh at her state.</p>
<p id="line_1844">All right, that should do it.</p>
<p id="line_1845">Even upon seeing the silly<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="A general Japanese term for: “Sorry-looking” (残念) one that makes people cringe" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> looks on Ramiris, the loyalty of her two servants remained unchanged. She may have always been looked down upon, but Ramiris’s motivation and enthusiasm were really something else. The level of enthusiasm she had displayed for the project probably exceeded my own. It seemed that I didn’t have to worry about her.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1846">By the way, what’s with Ramiris’s obsession with money?</p>
<p id="line_1847">Putting myself aside, I hadn’t heard of any <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that loved money this much… Compared to having money or not, shouldn’t the bigger problem be whether or not she had a job?</p>
<p id="line_1848"><em>That’s right, not a single soul had been visiting Ramiris’s labyrinth. Perhaps she was too idle and lonely. For Ramiris’s and my own sake, I hope there will be adventurers visiting. In order to achieve that, let’s quickly come up with a plan to make that happen.</em></p>
<p id="line_1849">After calling back Ramiris, whose mind had taken a trip, we began to draft the design graph for the colosseum construction.</p>
<p id="line_1850">My plans were as follows:</p>
<p id="line_1851">Outside the west gate, there was a plaza at the end of the road. We’d expand the plaza first, then start the construction. Since there was plenty of space, we could also open up a stable for the travelers to rest their horses in. In the future we would be adding tracks on the streets for trains to run on. I recalled planning for trains in hopes that royalty would ride on them. If we could ensure the safety of travel routes, it would be easy to attract wealthy tourists. That, of course, would not be the only purpose of trains. With them we would be able to transport large amounts of cargo. This infrastructure would likely also contribute significantly to the city’s development.</p>
<p id="line_1852">Since part of this plan was a scheme with the hope of developing the city, I hoped for it to work out well without complications. We might even set up a station near the colosseum… It would become a burden for the tourists if the distance were too far, so the standard would be within an hour’s walk from the gate. Having a location near the town would be better. Because the tourists would be walking, we would get customers at the inns along the route. Unlike my original world, people mostly relied on their legs to travel in this world. Most people could easily walk back and forth for tens of kilometers. So it shouldn’t be an issue to have some distance between buildings.</p>
<p id="line_1853">Keeping these factors in mind, I considered the location for construction—</p>
<p id="line_1854">“Why? Isn’t there any empty lot in the town as well?” Ramiris pointed out and corrected me.</p>
<p id="line_1855">“Those are used as shelters for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The temporary residences set there would pose trouble for building a colosseum.”</p>
<p id="line_1856">“Can’t we just chase the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> out of town for now and construct at this place until <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama finishes building their new cities—”</p>
<p id="line_1857">As I began to explain to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Ramiris suddenly proposed something unexpected.</p>
<p id="line_1858">“If that’s the case, why not have them move into my labyrinth? You can move the area entirely into it without change and it won’t cause much trouble.”</p>
<p id="line_1859">Did you catch the drift? <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I looked at each other over and over.</p>
<p id="line_1860">“D-Do you mean that, you can move the people inside there along with the buildings?”</p>
<p id="line_1861">“Well—it’s probably useless for living people. It requires personal permission before moving them into the labyrinth. If the objects do not possess the personal will of the owner, it won’t be moved, otherwise anything can be moved!”</p>
<p id="line_1862">“Are you serious? Are you implying that except the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you can move everything including the residences and personal belongings all into the labyrinth?”</p>
<p id="line_1863">“Yep, that’s the case!” Ramiris said proudly, but it was indeed impressive.</p>
<p id="line_1864">There’s no wonder she seemed so proud; this was an incredible skill.</p>
<p id="line_1865">After more careful inquiry, Ramiris revealed that this was her Intrinsic Skill, named ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Labyrinth Creation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> (Mini World)’<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The katakana annotation is “チイサナセカイ” or “小さな世界” (Small world)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>.</p>
<p id="line_1866">As the name implied, it allowed Ramiris to create the interior of the labyrinth. She was nigh omnipotent in that regard. The area affected by its power was also extensive, it is said that even the people and objects near the labyrinth could become its target.</p>
<p id="line_1867">For instance, if someone was directly outside the labyrinth, she seemed to be able to deprive the individual of weapons and gear.</p>
<p id="line_1868">This skill may seem to be overpowered, but it did appear to have its limits. For example, if the person’s equipment possessed personal will—or was affected by the user’s mana etc., it will not be affected by Ramiris’s power. However, people who possessed such items were rare, so most would end up challenging Ramiris with only their bare hands.</p>
<p id="line_1869">She was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> after all, that title was not just for show—</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p id="line_1880">Stuff like that.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1881">Ramiris also switched to a serious expression and answered all my doubts.</p>
<p id="line_1882">First,</p>
<p id="line_1883">There didn’t seem to be any restriction to the number of floors it could construct, but in reality, it could only reach around a hundred floors or so.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1884">Second,</p>
<p id="line_1885">It took around one hour to create a single floor. The same went for additional floors, so it would take around one hundred hours to spawn one hundred floors. However, the energy consumption creating deeper floors seemed to increase exponentially, which appeared to be the reason behind the answer to the first question.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1886">Third,</p>
<p id="line_1887">Not only <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, even creatures such as insects could inhabit the labyrinth. I heard that there used to be spirits inhabiting the labyrinth before. That location had not yet disappeared but was stored in another level to isolate it from the outside world. It was also said that they were free to come in and out. If that’s the case, we would be able to fill the labyrinth with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> for adventurers to challenge.</p>
<p id="line_1888">Moreover, if you filled it with an abundance of magicule, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be born naturally. By adjusting the magicule concentration, you could also conveniently predetermine the strength of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on different floors could be banned from interacting, so setting up difficulty levels seemed to not be a problem either.</p>
<p id="line_1889">And the most important point was—we’d come up with a way of filling the labyrinth with magicule. We would be doing that after we had prepared the contents for the labyrinth.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1890">Fourth,</p>
<p id="line_1891">Ramiris’s Intrinsic Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Labyrinth Creation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ had extraordinary efficiency, its interior structure could be changed in around an hour. After one change, it would remain fixed for twenty-four hours. That came, of course, with additional conditions. You couldn’t make something out of nothing. It seemed that there was no way to generate organism such as vegetation, so we could only rely on creating inorganic walls to make the labyrinth… But it was not actually changing the whole structure, only the interior design of it that we’d prepared, this way it wouldn’t cost too much time. By the way, it was also very simple to swap floors. The previously stated rules applied, meaning every twenty-four hours only one change was permitted, but it was still very convenient.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1892">Fifth,</p>
<p id="line_1893">This was honestly surprising, but what happened when you died inside could be altered by Ramiris’s will. Provided she was aware of the situation, Ramiris could even resurrect the dead. I was still contemplating what to do about the disposal of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ corpses and such and how to deal with the unfortunate deaths some adventurers might suffer. Well, as it turned out I heard something very unexpected.</p>
<p id="line_1894">We didn’t have any examples of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> born in the labyrinth to judge yet. However, Ramiris mentioned that she had resurrected adventurers several times before.</p>
<p id="line_1895">The secret behind this was related to the “Permission of the target,” as mentioned by Ramiris before. It wasn’t an exaggeration but apparently the will of “I would like to go in” was crucial. It was a pre-condition, without which entering the labyrinth was impossible. It was the same reason why I was able to enter the labyrinth before. If you tried to bring someone asleep inside, you would be blocked at the entrance.</p>
<p id="line_1896">Infants were exceptions. Children of young age have yet to form free will, so they appeared to be considered as goods and would gain protection. It was not impossible to force someone into entering the labyrinth, but this would also create a lot of pressure on Ramiris, such an action might fail due to the repulsive effect. So she wasn’t willing to spend time doing such a boring thing.</p>
<p id="line_1897">That’s about it, the prelude stops here.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1898">Ramiris had the ability to rule over the people who entered the labyrinth. With that being said however, it still required the person’s consent. If they were willing to accept Ramiris’s management, she would be able to keep track of their status at any instant.</p>
<p id="line_1899">“That’s right, didn’t we really enjoy pranks? We just wanted to have fun watching how shocked people looked, but my conscience won’t sit well if they had actually died. That’s why we always knew when to stop and allowed people to return alive,” Ramiris proclaimed with her chest high.</p>
<p id="line_1900">There were people who were unlucky and died, but that probably happened outside of the labyrinth. After all, Ramiris had no intention of killing me either back then.</p>
<p id="line_1901">And there was also the Elemental Colossus that tried to kill me, did they put that thing there knowing that people could be resurrected? I had wanted to ask, “What type of trial is this,” but now it made more sense.</p>
<p id="line_1902">“In other words, even if adventurers enter the labyrinth to eliminate <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> they won’t get killed and can be revived?”</p>
<p id="line_1903">“Yes. As soon as they are thrown out of the labyrinth they will appear as if nothing had happened when they are resurrected from death. But it would be problematic when the number becomes too large, so it should be best to have them wear the items I’ve prepared for resurrection.”</p>
<p id="line_1904">With the identification items crafted by Ramiris using ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Labyrinth Creation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ people could be revived outside the labyrinth if they died. And so, the most worrying problem of safety had been resolved.</p>
<p id="line_1905">“Excellent! This is wonderful, Ramiris-chan!”</p>
<p id="line_1906">“Really, really, really? Am I not impressive indeed?”</p>
<p id="line_1907">“Hmm! Now our ambition is as good as accomplished.”</p>
<p id="line_1908">“Is that the case? I think so too!”</p>
<p id="line_1909">We looked at each other and nodded.</p>
<p id="line_1910">“Thanks for the help, Ramiris.”</p>
<p id="line_1911">“No problem, just count on me. Now you can rest assured like you’ve boarded a huge ship.”</p>
<p id="line_1912">A huge ship you said. I hope it’s not made of mud.<s>(Or called the Titanic)</s></p>
<p id="line_1913">Due to the difference in our size, we couldn’t really shake hands, but we communicated with our hearts.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1914">I had accepted Ramiris’s proposal, and I was now heading to the empty lot located at the southeast side of town to build the colosseum. We would be building the dungeon under that spot.</p>
<p id="line_1915">As for the opera house, we would be building it at the northwest side where many classy health resorts stood. There were also a stadium, museum and other buildings constructed in the hotel area that we built beforehand in case they came to be useful in the future, so we decided to build one more to catch up with the festival.</p>
<p id="line_1916">With the plans for the dungeon and the opera house finalized, the problem was with the colosseum.</p>
<p id="line_1917"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was absent, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and his men were quite capable too. Before the unveiling of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it could definitely be—</p>
<p id="line_1918">“—The situation is exceptionally dire, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_1919"><em>Ah, so was the schedule really that tight after all?</em></p>
<p id="line_1920">But that was probably only natural. Normally speaking such construction projects took years to complete, it was really asking too much from them to complete it in a month plus a handful of days. No matter how powerful <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were, it was indeed still a dire spot.</p>
<p id="line_1921">“Saw that coming… I understand, I’ll help as well. I’ll handle transportation of soil and processing steel.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1922">Despite how I may look now, I had worked at a general contractor company before I was reincarnated. Even though I was not that skillful in field work, having some knowledge of the discipline was better than having none. Moreover, I had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei with me as well, so I should be able to figure out something.</p>
<p id="line_1923">“I wanna too! I’m gonna help too!”</p>
<p id="line_1924">“Then, I should also assist as well.”</p>
<p id="line_1925">“Indeed. We follow the will of Ramiris-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_1926">Since Ramiris and her servants also agreed to help, let’s get to work soon. We arrived at the construction site full of camps and laid out the blueprint. I quickly modified it and handed it over to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1927">“I see. Then there shouldn’t be a problem anymore.”</p>
<p id="line_1928">“Great, I still have to let the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> know what we intend.”</p>
<p id="line_1929">First, we were going to host a meeting to explain things. Right now many <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were out at work, so I decided to explain the situation to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Suphia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Alvis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1930">“If that’s the case, we will follow the will of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama—”</p>
<p id="line_1931">“Right. We don’t have a reason to object anyway.”</p>
<p id="line_1932">After hearing my explanation, the two agreed without hesitation. It was shocking how fast they agreed to it. They also told me to not to do any further explanation for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1933">“Eh, is that really okay?”</p>
<p id="line_1934">“No problem, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. We are in your care with residence and diet. We should be the ones to repay your debts, so allow us to help with the construction of the colosseum.”</p>
<p id="line_1935">“Besides, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama is also participating in the festival that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama is holding. So we have to help regardless.”</p>
<p id="line_1936">After saying so, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Suphia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Alvis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> agreed to assist us.</p>

<p id="line_1938">“Right, just count on me!”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1939">After discussing with them, we decided to have <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Suphia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> lead the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Afterwards, things progressed rapidly, and everything was on point. The process was so swift it was almost shocking. With <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Suphia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s orders, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> all exited the tents. Glancing through the lined up <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, we had Ramiris move the tents into her labyrinth. In the next instant, the location had been cleared. While feeling somewhat hesitant, I activated ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gluttonous King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Beelzebuth" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ and bit out a square-shaped pit in the ground to set up the steel structure.</p>
<p id="line_1940">With <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the rest lining up and paving the processed rock materials to fill in the walls, we were unexpectedly able to construct a flawless, beautiful product in only a day. And as such, this massive underground space was created with a huge gate set at its entrance. Given my advanced knowledge, the speed of completion had been quick beyond belief.</p>
<p id="line_1941">“A-Amazing. We are getting this as my castle… Ah, right! I set it up so touching the door here will teleport you to the floor with all those tents just now.”</p>
<p id="line_1942">Since Ramiris had said so, we immediately went in to have a look.</p>
<p id="line_1943">The scene stretched out before us, the living space of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had indeed been moved here in one piece. There was even air-conditioning which made living inside more comfortable than living in the wild. Even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Alvis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Suphia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked surprised.</p>

<p id="line_1945">“Indeed. There doesn’t even seem to be any rain, so it shouldn’t be an issue if we just directly sleep on the ground…”</p>
<p id="line_1946">This was their conversation. There didn’t seem to be any complaint, so there shouldn’t be any issue.

<p id="line_1947">“Will it get dark at night in there?”</p>

<p id="line_1950">Since they were not conducting any agricultural work, I asked Ramiris to only simulate the day-night cycle. It felt more convenient than I imagined as it could be applied in other fields. It prompted me to consider all sorts of possible plans.</p>

He was able to greatly shorten the time normally required for this by using magic to dry the wood.</p>
<p id="line_1953">I was under the impression that I had already thrown away things such as common sense, but upon laying my eyes on this sight, I couldn’t help but realize, yet again, “Ah, this is an isekai all right.”</p>
<p id="line_1954">If we proceeded at this rate, we might actually finish by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The soil I just ate and spat out was piled up as a small mountain, surely they would make good use of it as well to construct a majestic colosseum.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_1956">I nodded after hearing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words and decided to let him do his thing until the project was completed.</p>
<p id="line_1957">When everyone officially started to work, Ramiris was left alone. In order to prevent the impetuous Ramiris from hindering everyone, I should give her a job. And if there was any job Ramiris could work on, it would be expanding the labyrinth. Given this opportunity, we should be a bit more thorough.</p>
<p id="line_1958">Speaking of which—</p>
<p id="line_1959">“Ramiris, your ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Labyrinth Creation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ is really strong…”</p>
<p id="line_1960">It was a large area of land being moved into the labyrinth in the blink of an eye. Although I didn’t really want to praise Ramiris, this one thing left me deeply impressed. Honestly, I think this thing called labyrinth is really awesome…</p>
<p id="line_1961">“It’s all right, just all right! Right now there are only some secret rooms for my fairy friends, the level with corridors. There will be new floors added tomorrow!”</p>
<p id="line_1962">I recalled she said that it was an hour per floor. If we were building a hundred-level labyrinth underground, it may be an insurmountable challenge with modern technology alone.</p>
<p id="line_1963">But Ramiris’s power could make it reality. And given that was the case, a man should pursue romance (epic fantasy)<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="浪漫を求めるのが男というもの, Romance also means an epic, heroic adventure. Anyone remember the Dragonball closing theme “I’ll Give You Romance”?" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>.</p>
<p id="line_1964">“All right then, I’m counting on you to build the maximum one-hundred floors.”</p>
<p id="line_1965">“Eh! Do we really need that many?”</p>
<p id="line_1966">“Yes. I want to add in all sorts of contraptions and change the strength of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> based on floors.”</p>
<p id="line_1967">“It’s a piece of cake for me, but can I ask about something?”</p>
<p id="line_1968">“What is it?”</p>
<p id="line_1969">“I’ve been curious just now, what exactly do you plan to do in spawning the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>? Where are you capturing them from?” Ramiris asked me.</p>
<p id="line_1970">It did seem quite exhausting to increase the floors to one hundred, it’s no wonder she would question me. But I had my own plan in mind. In order to convince Ramiris, I let her in a little about my scheme.</p>
<p id="line_1971">“It’s actually like this, but you’ll have to keep it a secret…”</p>
<p id="line_1972">With this magic word, I began my explanation to Ramiris covertly.</p>
<p id="line_1973">As I explained my plans for her dungeon, Ramiris’s eyes became brighter and brighter.</p>
<p id="line_1974">“Oh, so you mean, you mean—”</p>
<p id="line_1975">“Hmmhmm—next we will be doing this, Ramiris-chan—”</p>
<p id="line_1976">We whispered to each other and raised ideas. Both of us were enjoying this.</p>
<p id="line_1977">We had a pleasant chat—and were rushing towards a direction that, ideally, we should avoid; the unexpected idea of an advanced dungeon was gradually formed.</p>
<p id="line_1978"><em>Is this really okay</em>? Although this though crossed my mind, there was no going back on the matter. <em>All we can do is make it.</em> Ramiris was also full of motivation and promised me she would devote herself to making the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_1979">“You can slack a bit while doing it.”</p>
<p id="line_1980">“Hmph! Now that I’ve heard such amazing ideas, how will I be able to sit back and relax! I’m doing it. I’m doing it!”</p>
<p id="line_1981">I intend to spark up Ramiris’s motivation a little bit, so I spoke about it to encourage her, yet I didn’t expect to light up her spirit completely. I was happy that Ramiris could understand that sense of romance; that such a bold idea may have a chance to be realized was what I was looking forward to at the moment.</p>
<p id="line_1982">“Then please work hard. I’ll do my best to collect the necessary resources.”</p>
<p id="line_1983">“I understand. Good luck, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>
<p id="line_1984">“Right, the same goes for you, Ramiris.”</p>
<p id="line_1985">We exchanged these words of encouragement, as a satisfied smile hung on both of our faces.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1986">I left after the conversation. The sun had already begun to set. We seemed to have chatted for a long time. The work today was concluded, and people started to pack up and cook food.</p>
<p id="line_1987">It would be embarrassing to be a hindrance to them, so I told <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Suphia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and the rest to return tomorrow and then left the construction site shortly after.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1988">I decided to drop by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s workplace.</p>
<p id="line_1989">He’d been working on experimental weapons and gear out of interest. My visit this time was to ask him whether he could give me the products that couldn’t be sold as merchandise.</p>
<p id="line_1990">Right now, the southwest area of the town had become the industrial area. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s workshop was also over there, with the workshops of his disciples surrounding it as well as dorms for the apprentices who didn’t have their own shop. All these in addition to a large number of warehouses. Moreover, there were also inns and canteens set up specially for the craftsmen and apprentices, everything looked very prosperous. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s workshop was built at the central area.</p>
<p id="line_1991">Seeing that I was visiting, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> came out to welcome me delightfully. After greeting and sharing a dinner with me, I asked him to bring me to the warehouses.</p>
<p id="line_1992">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, this way. The items stored at this warehouse are all very distinct, they can’t be wielded by any random person. Is that really okay?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked worriedly, to which I nodded in response implying that it was fine. Just as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had said, some of these items were simply too strong for average men to use. Some of the items that he kept in the warehouse were too overpowered, others were too difficult or dangerous to use.</p>
<p id="line_1993">Some of the armor pieces were good examples to illustrate this point: For instance, there was armor that absorbed the wearer’s mana in order to activate a magic defense barrier. It sounded pretty impressive, but in reality, it would draw mana without a limit, so after some time the armor would kill its user. Even though it was amazing that it provided a defensive barrier, such gear had no use in practice.</p>
<p id="line_1994">There were others, such as a sword that absorbed the surrounding magicule until no magic could be cast nearby and then converted it into a huge blast. The strength of the sword was guaranteed, but as for the safety of the user…quite the opposite. These types of weapons were terrifying and mustn’t be used under any circumstances.</p>
<p id="line_1995">There was also armor that gifted the wearer with extraordinary physical capabilities for a fixed period of time. But as soon as that time was exceeded, all of the user’s muscle tissue would be torn rendering him immobile, leading to death without healing magic. A savage armor indeed…</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1996">In short, there was equipment that caused the wearer to die an untimely death. I believed there wasn’t anyone stupid enough to use them without first appraising their properties. That part I didn’t find necessary for myself to handle, regardless of that, it should be fine in Ramiris’s labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_1997">“No, it’s all right. Having those very obvious properties may actually prove to be valuable.”</p>
<p id="line_1998">In fact, all of this equipment was of very fine quality. Half of them were of value above rare-grade, and among them were also precious items that appeared to be strong enough to rival unique-grade equipment. They were the same type of equipment as the scaled shield and tempest dagger.</p>
<p id="line_1999">I picked one of them up—a tempest longsword—and said to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> while examining it: “Equipment of such amazing quality, just because they are experimental shouldn’t make us just store it here without using them. Surely this gear would also want masters who can wield them, right?”</p>
<p id="line_2000">I made sure to be extra edgy, making things sound extra <em>deep</em>, which <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was deeply moved by upon hearing.</p>
<p id="line_2001">“Is that so? Then please take as many as you like.”</p>
<p id="line_2002">This was (definitely) not lying to him, though I felt my heart hurt a bit.</p>
<p id="line_2003"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> took out many pieces of equipment from the warehouses. As for why I was taking them, it was to put them into the treasure chests in the labyrinth. The adventurers would get the equipment at the level corresponding to the strength of the gear. That’s why I was definitely not lying. I shouldn’t mind that much and take them happily.</p>
<p id="line_2004">By the way, they sure were capable of making so many of these. There were a lot more now than last time with more than a hundred items. Not only was there bizarre equipment, there were also items challenging to use. If this assortment of items had anything in common, it’s that they were all of higher class compared to the merchandise I saw at the capital of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I felt that all of these weapons and gear could only be seen in an auction.</p>
<p id="line_2005">After my evolution to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was also blessed with the Unique Skill ‘Godly Craftsman.’ Apart from his original Unique Skill ‘Researcher,’ he had gained newfound ability to further his craftsmanship. Now he had even surpassed Kaijin. If <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was serious with his production, the quality of his work would often be unique-grade. They were at least guaranteed to be rare-grade. That’s why they were only showing the work of his disciples at the exhibition.</p>
<p id="line_2006">“By the way, you are really good. I learned about blacksmithing before, yet I can’t make such impressive items.”</p>
<p id="line_2007">“Hehe, it’s quite embarrassing to be praised by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. Oh, I should give this to you before I forget.”</p>
<p id="line_2008"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was very humble, yet his expression suddenly froze as he ran into the further part of the room and returned while carrying something.</p>
<p id="line_2009">“What is this?”</p>
<p id="line_2010">“Sir<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Kurobee responds to Rimuru’s comments and questions with a “はい” in the beginning of the sentence, which is like “Yes sir/To answer your question.” Same for the next line." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>, I’ve kept you waiting for too long, it is finally complete,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said while handing me the thing, it was a straight sword (chokuto) with a dark blade.</p>
<p id="line_2011">Not too long and not too short. The sword was made just for me with an ideal length beautifully crafted.</p>
<p id="line_2012">“This is—”</p>
<p id="line_2013">“Yes, this is my finest masterpiece.”</p>
<p id="line_2014">The blade appeared to be jet black and wholly unremarkable. It wasn’t emitting any incredible power nor was it triggered using magic.</p>
<p id="line_2015">But this would suffice. The focus of the sword was its strength. It would not break easily or be bent and fit very well with my mana. Moreover, unlike <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s Moonlight Rapier, it would not harm things in its surroundings.</p>
<p id="line_2016">Based on these considerations for a weapon that wouldn’t cause me any concern, it was the best.</p>
<p id="line_2017">“Amazing, this is amazing, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.”</p>
<p id="line_2018">“I’m also highly satisfied with the product. The sword is not completed the way it is right now. As I’ve explained to your before, the ideas proposed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, slots can be drilled in the base of the blade.”</p>
<p id="line_2019">Upon hearing so, I looked at the base of said blade.</p>
<p id="line_2020">“But there aren’t any slots here?”</p>
<p id="line_2021">“No. Other weapons will have slots drilled upon being crafted. But this straight sword is different. After being immersed in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s mana, it will grow—evolve. And it will look the same as now, like an average weapon,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> elaborated proudly.</p>
<p id="line_2022">I heard that afterwards the quality of the sword was to surpass Legendary-grade… I wasn’t sensing it in person just yet. As of this moment, we were still researching with other equipment and the crucial magic crystals for enchanting the slots had yet to be completed. Drilling slots alone would be meaningless, so it was no use for me to be anxious about it. I decided to wait and look forward to the arrival of that day.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2023">Having received my own special sword, I departed from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s workshop happily. Additionally, I had the equipment I came for in tow. I’d put these items in the treasure chests and deploy them in the labyrinth. The equipment with higher quality would be guarded by the floor guardians (boss of each level), it would be pretty interesting. This almost felt like crafting a real dungeon labyrinth, how exciting.</p>
<p id="line_2024">Indeed, these experimental or even failed works could still earn quite a lot of money from being auctioned off directly. If I asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Fuze for help, they would probably secure a tidy profit in their own way. It would be more pragmatic, but we shouldn’t do it. The important thing here was the exchange between <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and humans.</p>
<p id="line_2025">I wanted to attract people to visit my kingdom and let them experience the beauty of Tempest Federation. In addition, I wanted them to feel the charm of this nation in person so that they would return again. We should consider the equipment as a small cost to reach that goal.</p>
<p id="line_2026">Besides, things were not over after I delivered the items. I already had outlines for the future. The adventurers would infiltrate the dungeon to bring back all sorts of items. Given it was extremely dangerous to use un-appraised weapons or gear, it was time for the “Appraisal Shop” to shine. Since all these items were crafted in our nation, we would also have complete knowledge of their effects. As long as the method of using them was not mistaken, many of these items could be useful in their adventures. There were some dangerous items included as I’ve mentioned, but I thought it would be fine if our nation bought those items back.</p>
<p id="line_2027">Money needed to flow in order to have value, it was meaningless to only fill our own wallet. First, it was imperative to buy back necessary ingredients, and then pay the expenses to some extent, the rest we could even give back to the adventurers. After some time, adventurers would naturally begin to spread the news and so the reputation of our nation would increase. All of this hinged upon our ability to retain a steady stream of customers to make good use of the buildings we constructed, not to mention the amazing promotional impact it was going to have. We should strive to make our investments count.</p>
<p id="line_2028">The southeast area would have the colosseum built with Ramiris’s dungeon beneath it. There were also inns and civilian houses charging a fair price on the southwest side. Unlike the northeastern block with many classy hotels, the facilities there would be more down to earth. This place would primarily appeal to adventurers, with the added benefit of keeping different classes separate. It was also most convenient to visit the labyrinth from there, so business would definitely be booming.</p>
<p id="line_2029">When Ramiris said that she wanted to move here, I was still worried about what to do. In terms of results, I suppose I had made the right call.</p>
<p id="line_2030">As far as the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Colosseum" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was concerned, we would be hosting one or two major events every year. Beyond that, we would organize all kinds of events on normal days as well. Military training or events for adventurers to test their skills, to name a few. There were actually plenty of activities if I thought about it carefully. Underneath in the dungeon, we could also run field experiments and examine the results. Since we couldn’t die while inside, we might even do some dangerously excessive and over-the-top training.</p>
<p id="line_2031">Perhaps it could be for more than just commercial usage, there were plenty of areas it could be applied—concerning these ideas, I decided to discuss things with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2032">So we had our “bait.”</p>
<p id="line_2033">But right now it was too early to decide exactly how the dungeon would be used. I want to ponder on it after it was complete. In order to complete the final step, I decided to negotiate with a key figure.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2034">The key figure of this plan—Veldora-san.</p>
<p id="line_2035">He was currently resting in the garden hut at my estate. The lone estate was like a tearoom with the Japanese style of quiet beauty. In fact, this place had a secret—uh, I’ll put that aside for now. Let’s just say that Veldora has become used to staying there and considers it his home.</p>
<p id="line_2036">Whatever really…</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2037">“Hey, Veldora. I’ve got a request for you, is it okay?”</p>
<p id="line_2038">“Uh? What is it, I’m pretty busy.”</p>
<p id="line_2039"><em>Hmm, I see that you are reading manga, so yeah, there’s no way you’re not free</em>.</p>
<p id="line_2040">“Is that so…what a pity then. That’s a waste of such an interesting thing… But since you’re busy then it can’t be helped. It’s such a rare chance for you to release your—oh, you are busy. Sorry that I bothered you.”</p>
<p id="line_2041">Saying this, I pretended to leave. Although this was basically me leaving my own room, which made me feel kind of bad, there was plenty of places to spend the night. And even with that being said—</p>
<p id="line_2042">“Umm, hol’ up. I’m a busy man indeed, but since it is you who came asking, it can’t be helped. Tell me about it!”</p>
<p id="line_2043"><em>So did he really bite?</em></p>
<p id="line_2044"><em>Gullible as always.</em></p>
<p id="line_2045">Veldora-san had the nickname of “Gullidora”<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="This is actually グエルドラ, Gueredora, but basically, it’s just a pun name to say Veldora is very gullible. (Gullible Veldora)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>. I’d known for a while that he was easily tricked. To me, outsmarting this guy was like twisting the hands of an infant. And given this was the case, what came next was much easier. I pretended to be deep while phrasing things very intriguingly.</p>
<p id="line_2046">“The thing is, I plan to design a home just for you…”</p>
<p id="line_2047">“W-What are you talking about? Building a place just for me, is this true?”</p>
<p id="line_2048">He had taken the bait. His eyes left the manga, and he began to pay attention to my words intently.</p>
<p id="line_2049">“That’s right! built just for you. But if you are so busy—”</p>
<p id="line_2050">“Wait, don’t be so hasty. You and I go way back after all, so of course I’ll prioritize your request, GA-HAHAHA!” Veldora-san said that so arrogantly.</p>
<p id="line_2051">But this was good.</p>
<p id="line_2052">Seeing that he was waiting for me to continue, I might just tell him now.</p>
<p id="line_2053">Veldora often didn’t listen and I was forced into tricking him. Troublesome as it was, it remained the necessary ritual to draw his attention.</p>
<p id="line_2054">“So…some people need to make friends.”</p>
<p id="line_2055">“Hmmhmm, just speak your mind with the request!”</p>
<p id="line_2056">“The thing is, Ramiris is moving to town. We are building that girl’s labyrinth right under the colosseum and then—”</p>
<p id="line_2057">While he was still interested to hear me out, I told him about Ramiris moving in. Veldora understood faster than I expected.</p>
<p id="line_2058">“Oh, is it Ramiris? I’m not entirely sure about that girl’s ability, but I think she has the power to create tunnels that will lead to the same location no matter which entrance on the surface is taken. Is she able to create a labyrinth with complex layouts?”</p>
<p id="line_2059">“Right. She is also planning to add floors and I am thinking about preparing different types of traps.”</p>
<p id="line_2060">“There are even floors? I see, that chibi Ramiris seems to be stronger than I imagined.”</p>
<p id="line_2061">Upon hearing me say so, Veldora mirrored my serious expression. <em>You really are so, so gullible</em>. Next, I shared the entirety of the dungeon creation plan with Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_2062">“Isn’t it boring to just have an ordinary labyrinth? That’s why I’m trying to make it something awesome, a national brand. And today, I just discussed it with Ramiris. She is now working hard on expanding the floors.”</p>
<p id="line_2063">“Oh oh. So what does it have to do with your favor from me?”</p>
<p id="line_2064">“Honestly, I need a king to rule over the dungeon—”</p>
<p id="line_2065">“—You say king?”</p>
<p id="line_2066">“The management of the labyrinth will be run by Ramiris and me. Then there is a gate on the hundredth floor that leads to Ramiris’s home within the fairy maze. A guardian is required for that gate—no, we need the ‘Strongest’ guardian. Don’t you think that makes sense, Veldora-kun?”</p>
<p id="line_2067">“It makes sense! I see, as expected of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. So you want to hand that job to me, am I right?”</p>
<p id="line_2068">As predicted, Veldora had been fooled by my sweet-talk. Since he didn’t have much resistance against the word “Strongest,” I figured I could definitely lure him into agreement with that.</p>
<p id="line_2069">“That’s right, Veldora. Moreover, if you agree to this proposal, there’s another bonus waiting for you.”</p>
<p id="line_2070">“Oh? Although I’ve already decided to agree, let me hear about this bonus first.”</p>
<p id="line_2071">Hehehe. This was not just a bonus; it was actually the most important reason.</p>
<p id="line_2072">“Didn’t you want to release your <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> all the time? And that you were almost at your limit?”</p>
<p id="line_2073">“What! Could it be…”</p>
<p id="line_2074">“Bingo! You don’t have to hold back your <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> any more in the labyrinth. You can even return to your original dragon form.”</p>
<p id="line_2075">“Oh, ohoh…!”</p>
<p id="line_2076">“Think about it, a handsome dragon waiting at the depths of the labyrinth, giving off a solemn aura—”</p>
<p id="line_2077">“That’s me, right?” Veldora interrupted. “If that’s the case, I also get to unapologetically say to people: ‘GAHAHAHAHAHA, you’ve finally arrived! Welcome, pathetic bugs!’ and show off a little?”</p>
<p id="line_2078">He was already dying to give it a try. At the beginning he didn’t even seem to have a single scrap of motivation, but upon hearing that he got to release his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he appeared to be very excited.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2079"><em>How about I give it a final blow to seal the deal?</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2080">Thinking about it, I began to mention the final plan that I’d discussed with Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_2081">“I’ll also be deploying some of my men there to defend against the adventurers. Yes, this is a game you’ve wanted to play for a while—I want to make it a reality. So, does it sound like fun?”</p>
<p id="line_2082">I expected to make the dungeon into something resembling a realistic simulation game. After hearing Ramiris’s view, I suddenly got an idea.</p>
<p id="line_2083"><em>Deploying my men—aka <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to fight and defeat adventurers. In order to guard the treasure chests, there will also be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> bosses. Veldora’s magicules will flood the dungeon. Starting at the one hundredth floor, where the magicule concentration will be strongest, it will gradually thin out as it spreads across the floors above, which will have the desired effect of spawning relatively weak <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the upper floors, but progressively tougher ones lower down. The magicules leaked by Veldora during his sealed state was enough to spawn strong <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> such as Tempest Snakes at Rank A-minus. If it is Veldora now, I can’t fathom how strong the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> will be.</em></p>
<p id="line_2084">Honestly, there really was no need to deploy guardians. I didn’t see anyone even arriving at the hundredth floor, so there shouldn’t be such worries. The most important thing was having Veldora release his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I figured that after telling him to endure, he was at his limit. If I left him unattended, he might find a place to relieve himself without permission when no one was watching, that’s why I had to keep my eyes on him at all times.</p>
<p id="line_2085">If he accidentally released it in this region, apart from my executives and myself, any average people would be unable to tolerate it. With the magicule concentration spiking, people below Rank B might easily be killed. It would be asking too much to hope that Veldora would understand restraint, so Ramiris’s labyrinth was to be a facilitating factor.</p>
<p id="line_2086">After all, the interior of the labyrinth was an isolated space. I had confirmed that while exploring it in the past, there was no need to worry about magicule leakage. Moreover, even if Veldora released his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it wouldn’t shake the place. Even the sealed cave was unable to contain the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> released by Veldora after his full revival. Now that we established a research facility there, I couldn’t allow him to release it in the cave again… That’s why the dungeon was the ideal venue.</p>
<p id="line_2087">Then there’s also the ultimate goal, the hope that Veldora would release his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> completely—simultaneously preparing high concentrations of magicules to spawn <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That was after all the core of this plan. Not only would we have Veldora release his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but we would be capitalizing on it effectively. How do I come up with these amazing ideas? It’s killing two birds with one stone, actually, I should call it killing three birds. Not only would I be able to chase out Veldora who had been laying his nest in my house, I could have him be the magicule generator in the labyrinth to spawn <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Moreover, I got to give some work to this Veldora who had almost turned into a NEET.</p>
<p id="line_2088">Sadly for him, I didn’t think he would ever get the chance to play the part of the final boss of the Labyrinth…</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2089"><em>All right, shall we see how he’ll react?</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2090">Veldora stood up and sneakily put his manga into his pocket. He then extended his hand towards me intending to shake my hand.</p>
<p id="line_2091">“Interesting. This thing sounds very interesting, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Adventurers will fend off the minions and stand before me. Then I will get to teach these strong individuals a lesson. Of course, some adventurers will attempt to run away, but I will not let them off so easily! When times like that come, how about I say something like—‘GAHAHAHAHAHA, you can’t escape from my grasp. Don’t you know? No one escapes from the claws of the one and only <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Storm Dragon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—‘ I always wanted to try this line. Now am I finally getting the chance to deliver the line that I’ve been hoping to declare for so long? How exciting, I’m really looking forward to it!”</p>
<p id="line_2092">Spouting things like that, Veldora had now even begun daydreaming.</p>
<p id="line_2093">“Y-Yeah, you’re right…” I gave the affirmative to him without thinking, but I might have gotten Veldora too excited…</p>
<p id="line_2094"><em>Will this guy be all right like this? Since, you know, by normal logic, there’s not gonna be anyone who will have the ability to make it to the hundredth floor.</em></p>
<p id="line_2095">Although I was a little bit concerned, I kept an open mind for the plan.</p>
<p id="line_2096">“—I figure this honor can only be handled by you, so what do you think?”</p>
<p id="line_2097">“Of course I will do it. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you are so lucky to have come to me, I am after all the only one who could possibly fill this role!” he said, nodding his head earnestly. <em>I’m lucky that he’s an idiot. I played him like a fiddle…</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2098">And like that, I got Veldora’s assistance with ease.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2099">The next day—I paired up with Veldora to find Ramiris.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2100">The construction work on the colosseum started early in the morning. The site was full of energy. Even the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who went out for training, had returned to help and were moving about under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s instruction. Everyone was working their hardest, so in order to avoid disturbing them, we entered the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_2101">Upon entry, we found ourselves in the same room Ramiris was in… As promised yesterday, she seemed to be diligently expanding the labyrinth all this time.</p>
<p id="line_2102">“Oh, Ramiris. How are you doing?”</p>
<p id="line_2103">“Ah, Master! Long time no see, I’ve been good!”</p>
<p id="line_2104">Ramiris looked worn out but very satisfied as she made the response. It seemed she had been working too hard, even though I specifically told her not to overdo her part. Without me noticing, she had already sat down on Veldora’s shoulder. The two looked so close, how wonderful.</p>
<p id="line_2105">Despite the wonderful things, there were still some remaining problems. Ramiris apparently wanted to show off her skills some more now that Veldora had come, and she was completely ignoring my reminder.</p>
<p id="line_2106">“Just count on me! I’ll work hard. I’ll definitely complete all of them!”</p>
<p id="line_2107">I just wanted Ramiris to calm down. The first thing we needed to do was to eat breakfast.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2108">After finishing breakfast, Ramiris explained her progress to me. She had increased the size to fifteen floors. At this rate, we would reach the one hundredth floor in just a few days. The internal structure would be changed on the fly, so Ramiris didn’t have to slow down for those plans.</p>
<p id="line_2109">“Anyway, the rest of the floors will be expanding by themselves,” Ramiris said. “I’m pretty idle anyway, so why don’t I do the interior design for the finished floors too?”</p>
<p id="line_2110">It seemed that even without Ramiris’s conscious effort, the floors would increase automatically while consuming her power.</p>
<p id="line_2111">“Then, let’s prepare Veldora’s room first.”</p>
<p id="line_2112">I planned to set Veldora’s residence at the deepest level. In order to chase him out of my room, we would decorate the interior of his room first.</p>
<p id="line_2113">The bottom floor right now was a room devoid of anything. There were no walls, and naturally no hallways. There weren’t even any stairs, we could only see an empty lot with a gate.</p>
<p id="line_2114">“This is truly empty I see.”</p>
<p id="line_2115">“Oi oi oi, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, is this supposed to be my room? This really reminds me of the spot where I was sealed before…”</p>
<p id="line_2116">Veldora seemed kind of repulsed. That’s somewhat pitiful really.</p>
<p id="line_2117">“It’s all right, mentor! If I want, I can easily create walls and stairs.”</p>
<p id="line_2118">Seeing how displeased Veldora looked, Ramiris replied grinning.</p>
<p id="line_2119">“Right, then, regarding what type of room we are decorating, we will discuss through our ‘Telepathy Net’ and decide.”</p>
<p id="line_2120">With that being said, I promptly connected the three of us with ‘Telepathy Net.’ Then we began to construct an outline for the style of decoration based on my thoughts.</p>
<p id="line_2121">“Oh, ohoh! That’s it, that’s it, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! You are truly impressive. I see that there’s really nothing for me to worry about when you are handling things.”</p>
<p id="line_2122"><em>Did your satisfaction rate just suddenly cap out just like that?</em> Veldora nodded while humming “Hmmhmm.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2123">“It seems that Veldora is completely satisfied, can we decorate it to this type of style?”</p>
<p id="line_2124">“Just count on me! This is a piece of cake!”</p>
<p id="line_2125">Ramiris took on the mission without hesitation. And just like she put it, the empty lot was changed in the blink of an eye. The walls turned into thick and heavy stone walls, several small rooms and a hall appeared. The hall was square shaped with one hundred meters for each side. The solemn atmosphere of the interior design resembled the so called “Final Boss Level.” I transmitted the image in my head to her, and it turned out that she was able to recreate it wholly intact.</p>
<p id="line_2126">“You are so strong! This is just perfect…”</p>
<p id="line_2127">“Hmm, Ramiris, now I am satisfied!”</p>
<p id="line_2128">“Right, right! I am super strong after all!”</p>
<p id="line_2129">Ramiris probably seldom got praised by people, which was why she was overjoyed now. But even with that being said, she had been truly impressive this time. Building something like this in real life would likely not just take several years, but perhaps even decades to finish. Yet she completed it in the blink of an eye… It seemed that Ramiris held ultimate power over the dungeon and had complete freedom in shaping it.</p>
<p id="line_2130"><em>Ah, that’s impressive, impressive indeed. I’ve completely changed my mind on Ramiris and now see her in a different light. But next, being impressed here alone won’t make any progress.</em></p>
<p id="line_2131">On the surface it appeared that this hall was a room to confront adventurers. But its true purpose was to allow Veldora to restore his original form. So if Veldora was unable to properly relax here, the effort would’ve been meaningless.</p>
<p id="line_2132">However, based on Veldora’s recent activities, he did seem remarkably relaxed even without being in his dragon form… Since transforming into his human form, he could read manga and play games. This must’ve been the case. After all, he decided to stay in my room without leaving. Based on this, I decided to prepare a room tailored to his human form as well.</p>
<p id="line_2133">There were two gates in this hall. One of the large gates connected to the stairs to the upper floor, and the other gate lead to his private room for everyday use. Ramiris’s ability to recreate things was indeed powerful, she could construct an exact replica of what I envisioned.</p>
<p id="line_2134">“Oh? Is this my room?”</p>
<p id="line_2135">While ignoring the intrigued Veldora, I took out a whole set of furniture from my ‘Stomach.’ I laid out the rug stitched by the goblinas and put out the tables and chairs built by the craftsmen. I’d even prepared benches, so he could lie down for a while if he wished. I even put out a bed, though I wasn’t sure about whether it was necessary or not.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/illustrations/image6.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_2136"></p>
<p id="line_2137"><em>I think this will create a very comfortable space</em>. There were also shelves set on the walls with copies of the manga that Veldora liked. Unlike the solemn atmosphere the hall projected, this was built to be a comfortable space for private life that a commoner would enjoy.</p>
<p id="line_2138">“Nicu, nicu, very nicu, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-chan. I want that type of furniture too!”</p>
<p id="line_2139">After hearing how envious Ramiris sounded, I promised her that I would prepare a set for her as well. While I was originally worried about the size problem, that seemed to be unnecessary. Ramiris jumped onto the bench without hesitation and began to flip through manga. Speaking of this, it was the same during our last meeting. So I shouldn’t overthink it and just prepare another set.</p>
<p id="line_2140">Without me noticing, even Veldora had begun to play around and started rolling on the bed. He looked contented. The hall had an emphasis on atmosphere, the majesty of that in contrast to this room and how Veldora was behaving stood in stark contrast. <em>Right, there are things we just can’t force</em>. On this day we managed to sort out Veldora’s room and with that dismissed our meeting.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2141">After that, it took another whole week. Although we had slowed down a bit, the labyrinth had finally been built to a hundred floors. The interior designs were developed with modularity in mind. Thanks to this function, we were able to do an internal structural change every few days. Adventurers trying to memorize the layout would soon realize how futile those attempts would be. This design was truly evil.</p>
<p id="line_2142">Selling maps would be an option, however it would ruin the fun adventurers would have when they’re forced to create a new map every time they enter. But to put it in another light, they wouldn’t get bored this way… The labyrinth would always have a certain level of difficulty when being conquered, so that will never get old.</p>
<p id="line_2143">We at the very least had some measures to save progress. We placed a save point for every ten floors. I didn’t expect that in Ramiris’s labyrinth, you could conduct ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Spatial Movement" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ upon fulfilling certain conditions. More surprisingly, the act was said to be unaffected by magicule. It could even transport rations, which made it an extremely convenient function.</p>
<p id="line_2144">Of course, the same applied to humans and could transport them freely to any specific location. That was a save point. Once you reached it, you got to start from there in your next run. The same transportation method could be used by your companions too, so you could basically also cheat by having other people send you to a certain location.</p>
<p id="line_2145">We had differing views on this issue, but in the end, we took my suggestion to see how things would shape up before deciding on anything. Honestly speaking, cheating using savepoints would only give the people doing this a hard time. Since we were planning to put a boss on each floor. As the regional ruler of Jura Great Forest, I thought floor guardians were necessary components. Especially before reaching the save point set every ten floors, I wanted to deploy some especially strong <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2146">In other words, you couldn’t use the save point unless you defeated these powerful individuals. If they were capable enough to break through, the companions brought by these strong individuals surely wouldn’t be reckless. But if there was truly any problem, we would think about what to do by that time. In addition, I also wanted to prepare some treasure chests as rewards to incentivize defeating the bosses.</p>
<p id="line_2147"><em>But is it okay if the bosses are defeated?</em> Indeed, that was an important question. One of the abilities of Ramiris’s ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Labyrinth Creation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ was—the power of resurrection. Thanks to this skill, the adventurers inside it got to be revived.</p>
<p id="line_2148">As explained before, it required the will of the person, but the step would not be required if the individual had a ruler-subject relation with Ramiris. To my surprise, through the labyrinth created by ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Labyrinth Creation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ Ramiris’s subordinates seemed to be immortal. Ramiris would disappear upon being killed, but her subordinates could be revived at the save points. As for the subordinates we were referring to here, it applied only to those, who had forged a pact with her or to people that Ramiris acknowledged. This skill was undoubtedly a ferocious power beyond my imagination.</p>
<p id="line_2149">That was the biggest reason why she wanted Beretta. Ramiris herself was not that strong, but Ramiris’s army inside the labyrinth was invincible. That was why to Ramiris, who didn’t have a single subordinate, this invincible skill was as good as none at all. It was no use if it was a golem without will. The reason why the Elemental Colossus was destroyed is due to the fact that it was merely a doll.</p>
<p id="line_2150">Considering that, Beretta was no mere doll. After becoming Ramiris’s subordinate, Beretta practically became immortal<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="To be more specific, the term here is “不滅” (cannot be destroyed)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> within this labyrinth. With the addition of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san now, Ramiris packed quite a bit more military power than I had initially expected. After all, the two were already very powerful before, now given the attribute of immortality, it was hard to say who would win even if I sent out <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to confront them. Powerhouses such as Beretta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san were now also very busy, but they had no complaints as they assisted the construction of the colosseum outside…</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2151">Thanks to Ramiris, the labyrinth had smoothly entered a stage of near completion. Once this thing was settled, I’d better find them both to discuss the defense mechanisms inside the labyrinth. However, that would come later.</p>
<p id="line_2152">“Ramiris, how is the item I asked you to prepare coming along?”</p>
<p id="line_2153">“Oh, you mean this? I’ve been trying to craft one.”</p>
<p id="line_2154">The thing I asked her to prepare was the resurrection item. In order to obtain the attribute of “Immortality” from Ramiris’s ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Labyrinth Creation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ she must first receive confirmation of the individual’s will. But it was to be expected that everyone who wanted to enter the labyrinth would use one. Since this was a facility accessible to anyone—it was simply too hard to confirm the personal will and form a pact with everyone. If there weren’t a lot of people, Ramiris should be able to maintain control, but if too many people came in at the same time, Ramiris might not be able to keep up. That’s why she designed a single-use disposable item—that’s how she described it.</p>
<p id="line_2155">She took out a bracelet that, upon first glance, seemed like nothing special. It looked like a braided bracelet that you could tie on your wrist.</p>
<p id="line_2156">“About this thing, have you confirmed the effect?”</p>
<p id="line_2157">“It works great! I tried it on Beretta last night!”</p>
<p id="line_2158">“Hold up, hold up, why are you so mean to Beretta…”</p>
<p id="line_2159">I never expected that Beretta would say “I’m a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, so I won’t get eliminated regardless” at the time and offered his help happily. Although this was a request from me, they were still too reckless.</p>
<p id="line_2160">But that was worth the try, it was very useful in confirming the effect of the bracelet. Ten seconds after <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san had pierced Beretta’s core, his corpse was transported outside the dungeon and was completely revived.</p>
<p id="line_2161">“It seems perfect. I appreciate Beretta’s courage.”</p>
<p id="line_2162">“Hmm hmm. This is my first time making a single-use disposable item. Although I guessed it would come out smoothly, it’s truly wonderful that I was actually able to make it,” Ramiris nodded with a smile, it did sound like it was her first attempt.</p>
<p id="line_2163">It was worthy of celebration that it had been successful, but it was truly frightening to think of what would have happened had it failed. At least do an animal experiment first. I should be mindful of her doing something this reckless in future requests.</p>
<p id="line_2164">Regardless, the resurrection item had been prepared. The emergency escape item for returning to the surface also seemed to have been finished.</p>
<p id="line_2165">“Resurrection Bracelet “, “Return Whistle”—these we would be selling at the entrance of the labyrinth to prepare for the unknown. Whether the customers bought them or not was their choice. <em>However, please take responsibility for dying or getting lost in the labyrinth without the purchase.</em></p>
<p id="line_2166"><em>It is a buy from me, absolute buy.</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2167">I’d think about the price tag for it later. Regardless, the preparation work was done for now. By the way, this resurrection item called “Resurrection Bracelet “ actually only temporarily materialized Ramiris’s power. That’s why you could only be revived at the entrance after dying inside the labyrinth to be reset.</p>
<p id="line_2168">In order to prevent anyone from misunderstanding its function and therefore expecting it to be able to revive them at any location, including outside of the labyrinth, we needed to give a thorough explanation. There were a lot of people in this world that ignored other people’s advice, so I was a bit worried. If they really mistook things and ended up dying outside the labyrinth, it would be their own doing. Either way, I still couldn’t bear to see that happening. I should just specifically remind the people to be careful with it.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2169">With that, the dungeon was almost complete. How impressive that it only took a week. Perhaps <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei could even recreate that incredible skill, upon thinking so, I tried to ask it—</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2170">«Answer. Intrinsic Skill of Individual “Ramiris” cannot be recreated.»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2171">And like that it immediately turned me down. Such majestic work could only be achieved by Ramiris. At this point, I felt that I should tell her “Thank you for moving here.”</p>
<p id="line_2172">“You have worked really hard, Ramiris. Now we can finally commence the next phase of our plan.”</p>
<p id="line_2173">“Hehe, that’s without saying! I always give my all when I need to!”</p>
<p id="line_2174">After praising Ramiris who was flapping her wings and flying around, I turned to Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_2175">“Kept you waiting huh, Veldora-kun. It seems the time for you to release your <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has arrived.”</p>
<p id="line_2176">“Oh oh, finally after all the waiting! GAHAHAHA, leave it to me!”</p>
<p id="line_2177">The moment I’d been anticipating had finally arrived. There were air vents in this hundred-level dungeon and stairs that connected the floors. If people asked me how there was any air flow one hundred floors underground, I would answer by saying it was all because of magic. So honestly, there wasn’t really any need for air ventilation, but I still asked her to open them, reason being to have the magicules permeate to each floor more easily.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2178">There in the center of the hundredth floor’s hall, Veldora revealed his true self. And with it, his long suppressed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was released.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2179">“Then, here I go. HYAA—!”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2180">He didn’t really need to scream like that, but it was probably because of his mood. The vicious <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> blew towards me and Ramiris. Fearing an emergency, I had covered Ramiris with ‘Absolute Defense’ as well. The next instant, a shockwave arrived as if something had exploded.</p>
<p id="line_2181">“T-T-That was close… If <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t protect me, I might have been blown away…” Ramiris muttered while quivering.</p>
<p id="line_2182">Indeed, the shockwave was far more powerful than I imagined. Moreover, any average person would have been instantly killed by the concentrated magicules that filled the chamber.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2183">“GA—HAHAHA! I AM HERE!”</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/illustrations/image7.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_2184"></p>
<p id="line_2185">The final boss level—correction, the deepest hall in the labyrinth took up a wide space, but after Veldora restored himself to his original shape, it felt awfully narrow.</p>
<p id="line_2186">After not seeing Veldora in his dragon form for so long, that appearance was indeed filled with majesty. <em>Ah, seriously, he’s so authoritative when he shuts his mouth.</em></p>
<p id="line_2187">However…</p>
<p id="line_2188">“I feel so good! Ah, aren’t I just so magnificent? If I did this outside, it might not have been a good idea,” he casually said.</p>
<p id="line_2189"><em>It will be a catastrophe if you do this outside. While you are saying that it feels so good, you are still leaking out <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</em></p>
<p id="line_2190">“M-Mentor sure is strong… I didn’t expect that my own labyrinth would get knocked crooked by others…”</p>
<p id="line_2191">Just like Ramiris said, the walls had been bowed outwards by the ferocious wind. It was probably due to the strong internal pressure, but that wasn’t the reason why the attack was so shocking.</p>
<p id="line_2192">“Should I call you impressive? You must have been holding back for so long. Before things end up like this in the future, you’ve got to remember to release your <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> occasionally…”</p>
<p id="line_2193">Not only the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> he leaked, the magicule concentration alone was already sky high. It could only be imagined just how incredibly large Veldora’s magicule pool was. That’s why it was truly no good to wait for him to release it. In the worst-case scenario, he would have to start relieving himself more often one bit at a time.</p>
<p id="line_2194">By the way, the magicule concentration was truly immense. Just then an amazing idea crossed my mind. Should we perhaps set another room on the hundredth floor and turn it into a warehouse? We could then store the iron ores and other products from the mine in this room. Then by having them immersed in large amounts of magicule, they would be turned to magisteel ore very fast.</p>
<p id="line_2195">Magisteel ores are the rough stones of magisteel, its value could rival that of gold. The demand for them couldn’t even be reached by iron ore, and to us they were also very useful resources.</p>
<p id="line_2196">“Ramiris, can you create an additional hall next to this one?”</p>
<p id="line_2197">“Hmm, piece of cake!”</p>
<p id="line_2198">And so, I hurried her to do the preparations. Upon my next visit, I’d bring the iron ore from the town here as well.</p>
<p id="line_2199">As I thought of these cunning schemes, the magicules spread to the other floors as planned. Right now there weren’t any walls set up nor any other sort of areal partitioning. That’s why there weren’t any obstacles that hindered the magicules from permeating to every corner of the space. Even around underground level fifty, the magicule concentration was beyond that in the “Sealed Cave.”</p>
<p id="line_2200">Its effect had exceeded my expectations, so basically it was an absolute win. Next, we just had to wait for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to be born. The concentration was so high that it was terrifying, so a lot of strong individuals should be spawning.</p>
<p id="line_2201">With that hope in mind, we dismissed the meeting for this day.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2202">The next day, both Beretta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san were present. Veldora seemed to have maintained his dragon form to release magicules and was resting on the ground.</p>
<p id="line_2203">“Hey, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I haven’t been as comfortable as I was yesterday for a long time.”</p>
<p id="line_2204">“That’s great then. You don’t have to endure it anymore in the future, let go as much as you like. Just remember not to release any to the outside!”</p>
<p id="line_2205">“GAHAHA, I know.”</p>
<p id="line_2206">Do you though? I was a little skeptical, but I chose to trust him.</p>
<p id="line_2207">It wasn’t convenient to continue our conversation like this, so I asked Veldora to return to his human form. Then I started to explain the situation to Beretta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. Now we could get to work—I did want to say that indeed, there was still something before that.</p>
<p id="line_2208">I wanted a final confirmation from Beretta.</p>
<p id="line_2209">“Beretta, did you swear in front of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to pledge your loyalty to Ramiris? Has your sentiment changed since then?”</p>
<p id="line_2210">Beretta looked at me in shock. He must’ve been showing a rare change of expression under that mask.</p>
<p id="line_2211">“—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, please forgive my rudeness. As I have said before, I hope to serve you and Ramiris-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_2212">“Yes, I remember that. But, wouldn’t that be breaking your vow with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_2213">“…Yes. When that day comes, I’ll take the responsibility myself—”</p>
<p id="line_2214">“No, you don’t have to split hairs like that. As you have wished, Ramiris has moved to the town too. Now she is also responsible for running the labyrinth, do you wish to help her?”</p>
<p id="line_2215">“Of course!”</p>
<p id="line_2216">“If that’s the case, there wouldn’t be any problem. In terms of results, you are basically pledging your loyalty to me too.”</p>
<p id="line_2217">I’d heard about this before, so I had the idea for quite a while already. If Beretta wished, I’d let him change to serving Ramiris. Since he had made a deal with the so-called strongest <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, if he broke the vow Beretta wouldn’t be safe.</p>
<p id="line_2218">“Won’t you mind that? Then, I will serve Ramiris-sama,” Beretta replied without hesitation.</p>
<p id="line_2219">I felt as though all of this had been part of Beretta’s plan. <em>Well, never mind, that’s fine either way. This cunningness, who in the world did he learn it from—</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2220">«Answer. It’s of course—»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2221"><em>Ah, I don’t want to hear that answer. How careless. What does <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei think of me?

<p class="space-break" id="line_2222">«…»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2223">It seemed to be slightly displeased, but I didn’t care.</p>
<p id="line_2224">“That’s fine. Then, Beretta, pledge your loyalty to Ramiris in the future!”</p>
<p id="line_2225">“Even though I will become Ramiris-sama’s servant, I will not forget the gracious deeds done by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. If I may ever be of any use to you, just say the word.”</p>
<p id="line_2226">“All right, I’ll count on you then.”</p>
<p id="line_2227">As I finished my words, I deactivated the Creator Order (Master Lock) on Beretta and transferred “Master Access” to Ramiris. After the transference, I would only have access as the creator. If anything ever happened to Ramiris, the commanding right would return to me. But, as long as things didn’t end up that way, Ramiris would always be Beretta’s master.</p>
<p id="line_2228">Now I could be reassured. I wouldn’t get bad-mouthed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and Beretta as Ramiris’s guard was also trust-worthy.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2229">I felt that there were surprisingly plenty of ways of using the labyrinth. On the surface, it appeared to be a promotional medium to attract adventurers. Further behind the scenes, it was a channel for Veldora to relieve himself. Lastly as its by-product—it turned iron ores into magisteel ores using high concentrations of magicule. This will do. It seemed that by researching the mysterious substance known as “Magicule” in this world, we got to run this labyrinth effectively. That was beyond my expectation, which heightened the importance of this labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_2230">I wasn’t entirely sure about handing the mission of protecting the place to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san alone, but now with Beretta, I was a lot more assured.</p>
<p id="line_2231">As for Ramiris who gained commanding power over Beretta… The quick turn of events had made her a bit hysterical.</p>
<p id="line_2232">“Beretta has really become my subordinate… Now I’m finally not alone—”</p>
<p id="line_2233">“Ah, Ramiris-sama, you still have me.”</p>
<p id="line_2234">“Oh yeah! There’s also <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, now I have a big family!<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The word here is “大所帯” which means “a large (family) organization,” so it’s more akin to “I’ve got this huge group now.” But hell it’s pretty wholesome so why not family." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>”</p>
<p id="line_2235">Ramiris seemed overjoyed as she flew around Beretta. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san couldn’t help but smile admiring the sight of her.</p>
<p id="line_2236">Ramiris had been alone all this time, she must’ve been very lonely. Even though she only had two subordinates, she still said they were a lot… This worries me. It worries me greatly.</p>
<p id="line_2237"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was a very reliable person, yet she spoiled Ramiris too much. So Beretta would have to take on even more responsibilities, but I hoped someone with common sense like him would work hard too. He had the cunning and calculative side as well and would probably respond to my expectation.</p>
<p id="line_2238">“Beretta don’t mind me for now. I’ll have you take care of Ramiris. Please protect her well in the future.”</p>
<p id="line_2239">“Yes Sir! I shall guard her with my life!”</p>
<p id="line_2240">I had confidence in him. I could rest assured as long as Beretta was there.</p>
<p id="line_2241">The management of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> inside the labyrinth would probably keep <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s and Ramiris’s hands tied if they handled them alone. So it wouldn’t be a problem if they did encounter such things since Beretta was here. Things worked out smoothly.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2242">Veldora and I felt somewhat agitated by Ramiris who was making excited noises, but then again, the sight did put a smile on our faces.</p>
<p id="line_2243">Given that an official master-servant relationship was made, Beretta had become “immortal” inside the labyrinth. Even without a “Resurrection Bracelet “, the mechanism could still be carried out perfectly. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was without exception. The items such as “Resurrection Bracelet “ and “Return Whistle” that possessed Ramiris’s power were all watered-down versions of her skills. But, since Beretta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san were now her followers, they could avoid the hassle of using them. The same logic applied for the location of resurrection, as long as the save point had been set beforehand, it is said that they could revive wherever they wanted and didn’t have to be expelled out of the labyrinth every time. In addition, they could also do simplified ‘Transportation’ through the save point on each floor.</p>
<p id="line_2244">Speaking of Ramiris’s Intrinsic Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Labyrinth Creation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ it really had little use for herself, but instead was highly beneficial for her subordinates. <em>By the way… Infinite revival, the thought alone sounds terrifying already. Right now she only has two subordinates, and once this number increases…</em></p>
<p id="line_2245">In the future, there would gradually be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> born in the labyrinth. If she could tame them, she might be able to form a Ramiris Legion. Then it would become a major power so people wouldn’t look down on her and call her chibi. Such an army with the attribute of “Immortality” would pose a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p id="line_2246">From a standpoint of defense, Ramiris’s skill couldn’t have been any better. The only problem with it was that the user of the skill was Ramiris herself, who to this day had not been anyone’s concern.</p>
<p id="line_2247"><em>—But I guess it’s just Ramiris after all. So there shouldn’t be a problem and there is nothing to worry about. Such a cute fairy, she’s just a chibi that is afraid of being lonely. That’s why I don’t think she will go lead a huge army and plot something like that—</em></p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2248">Now we were entering the next stage, it was time to plan out the internal structures of the labyrinth. Since there were as many as a hundred levels, designing the labyrinth really was a laborious task. But, it’s not really a labyrinth if it doesn’t have traps, so let’s be interior designers for a while.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2249">By the way, the first level of the labyrinth was square shaped, and the four sides were of 250 meters in length. It was large enough to rival Tokyo Big Egg (Tokyo Dome), but the deeper you went, the narrower it got. Structurally, it had an inverted pyramid shape. Since Veldora was releasing his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on the bottom level, we built it like this so that it would be convenient for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to spread out evenly. Almost every condition we considered had been fulfilled, it could be said that the structure we designed went beyond common sense. But there’s no point breaking our heads overthinking such things.</p>
<p id="line_2250">Now, time to confirm what sort of traps to deploy:</p>

<p id="line_2251">Poison Arrow: Arrows smeared with poison will fly your way out of nowhere.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2265">That’s about it, something along these lines. I listed all the traps I could come up with to her and it turned out that almost all of them could be created.</p>
<p id="line_2266">“You are truly capable, Ramiris. Are you really able to make these types of traps?”</p>
<p id="line_2267">“Hmm! Inside the labyrinth, I can make whatever I want!!”</p>
<p id="line_2268">Indeed, it was just like how Ramiris put it. Now even though we were one hundred floors down, the air composition was no different from that on the surface. This was all thanks to Ramiris’s skill. It illustrated once again how super strong her skill was.</p>
<p id="line_2269">“By the way, what is this ‘Sealed Room’? Can it really be a booby trap?”</p>
<p id="line_2270">To her question, I cracked up a smile and replied, “Air—or I should say that there is a substance in the atmosphere called oxygen. Humans, or perhaps most creatures, will take in oxygen by breathing. Veldora and I are exceptions. If the concentration of oxygen drops too low, people will suffer hypoxia and may even die on the spot. That’s why adventurers should be cautious when faced with a room like that. After all, that’s a fixed rule of exploration.”</p>
<p id="line_2271">In general, it was fine if a room were sealed, but if you lit a fire inside, it would lead to a state of oxygen deprivation or may even cause the room to be filled with poisonous gases. Even if you discovered this type of room in ruins or labyrinths, you couldn’t immediately rush in. You must analyze the components of the atmosphere first and hold a skeptical view regarding whether there was poisonous gas remaining and assessing the concentration of the oxygen.</p>
<p id="line_2272">That is the basic rule of exploration, if an adventurer can’t even do that, he won’t last long. And since magic exists in this world, at least do the breathing with wind-element magic.</p>
<p id="line_2273">I explained this in a way that Ramiris could easily understand—although she didn’t seem to understand at all.</p>
<p id="line_2274">“Okay, I get now that it is some vicious trap. But it doesn’t really affect us, so we don’t have to pay too much attention to it, right? By the way, you… I had the feeling before that you were a pretty scary guy. But you also seem very capable. If it were me, I wouldn’t be able to come up with a trap like that…”</p>
<p id="line_2275">Knowing that they themselves wouldn’t have to worry about being harmed by the trap, Ramiris seemed to be reassured. She exclaimed so and praised me. She seemed to really believe what she said, and that kind of embarrassed me. If it were people who enjoyed gaming from my original world, they should be very familiar with these traps and even feel somewhat intimate with them.</p>
<p id="line_2276">But making them real is a horse of a different color. It was nothing like some amusement rides, you might pay with your life because of them. Moreover, attempting to overcome a labyrinth with these traps would likely take a couple of days. They might even take a few days just to take on a few levels, plus the terrain will alter, one must try to go all the way to the save point at the tenth floor.</p>
<p id="line_2277">If it was someone like us who had poison nullification and did not require breathing, eating or even sleeping, they should be able to conquer it using brute force by just tanking the damage. But this was not something average people were capable of. Even those who were worthy of the title of hero would need to rest. I personally was convinced that it would be quite the vicious labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_2278">“Are we perhaps setting the difficulty too high?”</p>
<p id="line_2279">“Is it? I find it okay.”</p>
<p id="line_2280">“Yeah, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. This is really nothing!”</p>
<p id="line_2281">My worries were laughed off by Veldora and Ramiris. If that’s the case, then there shouldn’t be a problem. I was persuaded and continued brainstorming the labyrinth routes.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2282">A few days passed after that, during which Ramiris joyfully prepared all sorts of traps. Beretta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san had been deploying them alongside her. I had planned out the labyrinth route with Veldora. We came up with several different models and registered them first so we could make the change anytime we needed. Everything had been going smoothly, but when we attempted to add “Terrain Effect,” Ramiris raised an objection.</p>
<p id="line_2283">“No, no no no. I can’t sustain that much energy!”</p>
<p id="line_2284">To put it simply, she had a problem with it.</p>
<p id="line_2285">—Actually, it made sense. In terms of the layout—we wanted every level to have a specific natural disaster theme that would cover the entire level. For example a fire level, frozen level or a storm level.</p>
<p id="line_2286"><em>Yeah, I guess creating a volcano is a no-go. I’ve come to believe that anything can be done with magic, but what I was asking for is simply too much.</em></p>
<p id="line_2287">“I see you have a point. Sorry, Ramiris, I was being too difficult—”</p>
<p id="line_2288">I gave up and decided to apologize to Ramiris. But then—</p>
<p id="line_2289">“Can’t that be solved if you capture a fire or ice dragon from somewhere? Do you need my help to catch some?”</p>
<p id="line_2290">What a familiar voice, but, that person shouldn’t be here. I turned around to see a pair of platinum pink ponytails.</p>
<p id="line_2291">It was Milim.</p>
<p id="line_2292">“Eh…? What are you doing here, Milim—”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2293">This was level one hundred underground. In other words, this was the very bottom level of the recently built dungeon. We hadn’t even made this location public, so by any rational logic she shouldn’t have been able to enter…</p>
<p id="line_2294">Yet she just did—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Milim stood there with a smug smile.</p>
<p id="line_2295">By the way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei seemed to have noticed that, but since Milim didn’t have hostile intent against me, it intentionally didn’t report to me… But actually, it was me who told it to do that. Though I should still reassess the command. It’s all because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san doesn’t know how to be flexible, what a headache.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2296">«…»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2297">That will be a topic to discuss in the future, right now let’s deal with Milim. Upon thinking this, I turned to Milim. And soon after, she remarked complacently: “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="fufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I know that you guys have been up to something interesting, so I came by to see. And you’ve ousted me without notice, how dare you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_2298">Milim finished with an arrogant posture while straightening her plotless, flat chest.</p>
<p id="line_2299">She was wearing her usual highly revealing clothes, but the area covered by clothing seemed to be more than last time. After being dressed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the goblinas, she may have become a bit more self-aware about dressing up in public. On her fists were the pair of drago knuckles that clashed with the rest of her attire. The light reflecting off its rough surface was emphasizing their existence. It was very much Milim’s style, she really was just a punk kid after all.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/illustrations/image8.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_2300"></p>
<p id="line_2301">I couldn’t bring myself to reject her, so if she really wanted to join the development—</p>
<p id="line_2302">“Heh, so it’s Milim. You are just a brat, how could you understand the sublime work of us adults? We are not playing around here, don’t get in our way!”</p>
<p id="line_2303">Veldora slanted towards Milim and exclaimed so while feeling justified. I didn’t have time to respond before he interjected. It was work in name indeed, but this didn’t seem like serious work at all… Not only him, even Ramiris decided to chase after Veldora’s footsteps.</p>
<p id="line_2304">“Mentor is right!” she yelled, confronting Milim. “We are working here, so an idler like you should just go home!”</p>
<p id="line_2305">The poor chibi was immediately trapped in Milim’s iron grasp. Her courage was commendable, but Ramiris, you don’t really have the strength to back it up.</p>
<p id="line_2306">I lacked that sort of courage, so I decided to ask in a normal way.</p>
<p id="line_2307">“You mentioned that we are doing something interesting, what were you referring to? It was all because of your letter that we are holding this grand festival.”</p>
<p id="line_2308">“What? Didn’t you ignore my letter?”</p>
<p id="line_2309">“How is that possible? Seriously, we are doing this to receive <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, so we can’t just offer the bare minimum, can we?”</p>
<p id="line_2310">Up until now Milim was looking displeased, but after learning that she hadn’t been ignored, she immediately regained her jovial mood, to the displeasure of someone else.</p>
<p id="line_2311">“Hold on, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! I’m a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> too! I’m just like you and Milim, a member of the Octagram!”</p>
<p id="line_2312">Seeing that Milim had received different treatment than herself, Ramiris began to throw a tantrum.</p>
<p id="line_2313">“Ramiris, there’s no such thing as receiving you at all, didn’t you move here without permission?!”</p>
<p id="line_2314">“What? What do you mean by moving here? Ramiris, could it be that you are living with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> now?”</p>
<p id="line_2315">After being pursued by questions from Milim and me, Ramiris was now the one who had lost her cool—</p>
<p id="line_2316">“That’s right! I was not invited, but that’s not important at all! Also I’m not gonna be alone in the future anymore now that I’m living with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> too!”</p>
<p id="line_2317">—Or so I thought that she has just lost her cool, instead she dropped this easily misunderstood statement.</p>
<p id="line_2318">“How cunning and cheeky of you! I want to live here too!”</p>
<p id="line_2319">“Hehe—! I came here for work. I’m helping <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, not a guest like you who can only give trouble to people.”</p>
<p id="line_2320">“What! How dare you say that, you are just a—”</p>
<p id="line_2321">Milim was furious and began to argue with Ramiris, who was not backing down either, even though she had no chance of winning, she accepted the challenge.</p>
<p id="line_2322">As for me, I just stood back and watched to avoid being affected. With that being said, if Milim begins to resort to violence in her confrontation, there would be no need to use verbal arguments. That’s why their conflict was but a verbal quarrel. The two were arguing against each other, but it looked pretty pathetic since both were lacking in the vocabulary department. Their exchanges of insults were all awful and would probably only make any bystander laugh.</p>
<p id="line_2323">Sometimes Ramiris would deliver a flying kick at Milim, to which Milim would chase after her in an attempt to grab onto Ramiris. It was like a game of tag, to any bystander, they would feel that they were just playing around with each other and they were actually on good terms. These two fellows had long been acquainted, so perhaps this was also a reflection of their affection for each other.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2324">Soon after, they suddenly held back midway through their quarrel, putting an abrupt end to the argument—because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> came by with desserts prepared in hand and scolded the two upon seeing this.</p>
<p id="line_2325">“No dessert for anyone who’s fighting!”</p>
<p id="line_2326">And because of these words, the two suddenly quieted down. The two who had made peace were now eating desserts together with much love. The scene suddenly became so harmonious, but I still had to ask Milim what she came for.</p>
<p id="line_2327">“By the way, Milim, why did you come here anyway?”</p>
<p id="line_2328">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="fufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, didn’t I just say? I feel as though you guys are doing something interesting.”</p>
<p id="line_2329">“No no no, eh, is that really the only reason?”</p>
<p id="line_2330">“Yep. But, I’m so lucky to have come. This thing called cake is the best, and this labyrinth thing also looks quite interesting. I didn’t expect that Ramiris would have been so useful.”</p>
<p id="line_2331">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="fufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—! I’m just like everyone else who has kept my power a secret. It’s just that you didn’t manage to discover it!”</p>
<p id="line_2332">Even though you say that, you yourself didn’t discover it either, Ramiris—That’s just my thought, I should keep it to myself. By the way, this girl Milim was really keen to spot an idea of this size. There was really nothing that could be hidden from Milim. She was already someone who had ex-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Frey as followers, and the speed at which she got here was truly shocking.</p>
<p id="line_2333">Basically, Milim was a wild card. Normally speaking, how was it possible for someone to run around outside all by herself, but it was not that surprising if that someone was Milim. It was really nothing to be astounded by if she showed up here. I’ll need to keep this in mind.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2334">“All right, now that we are done eating desserts, it’s about time to get back to work. Also Milim, if you won’t interfere, you can stay and play.”</p>
<p id="line_2335">How rare, Veldora-san had given a mature response. Now that I thought about it carefully, it would be a problem if these two (Veldora and Milim) started arguing. Because her opponent was Ramiris, Milim held herself back. But it might not have been the case if it was Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_2336">The labyrinth facilities we put so much effort in to set up would be affected by their brawl and probably be destroyed instantly. It seemed that Milim didn’t hold a grudge against Veldora, so we’re safe for now.</p>
<p id="line_2337">“Since mentor has said so, I don’t object either.”</p>
<p id="line_2338">It seemed that Ramiris had also agreed. Speaking of this, Milim was surprisingly on good terms with Ramiris, she was just intentionally playing tricks on her from the start.</p>
<p id="line_2339">“Just count on me! I won’t be a hindrance, so give me some work as well!”</p>
<p id="line_2340">Milim’s mood had improved and she appeared to be willing to join us. I personally didn’t have an objection, I was going to agree without hesitation, but there was something on my mind. There was a point I needed to confirm first.</p>
<p id="line_2341">“If that’s the case, can we have Milim join as well—”</p>
<p id="line_2342">“Hmm! Such an interesting thing, you should have come for me during the planning phase!”</p>
<p id="line_2343">“I get it, but putting that aside—Milim, won’t your subordinates object? Did you actually get the permission from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san and Frey-san?”</p>
<p id="line_2344">Although she appeared to be so wild and care-free, this girl was still a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> after all. Moreover, she had now taken the two ex-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s Frey and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as subordinates and even took Clayman’s territory to become an overlord ruling over a huge area of land. Though the management of the land had been handed to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Frey, she should have gotten much busier, at least in comparison to how it was before.</p>
<p id="line_2345"><em>Is Milim right now really allowed to stroll around like this so freely? Eh, that goes for me too? I’m honestly fine. My subordinates are all very capable, so I should just avoid interfering with them. Moreover, I really am doing and carrying out plans. I’m even doing planning now to attract tourists, so I’m definitely not slacking.</em></p>
<p id="line_2346">Putting my own matters aside, the focus was on Milim. After being asked by me, Milim averted her eyes.</p>
<p id="line_2347">“I guess…? You see, I’m very bright… Right? I definitely didn’t flee here because I hate studying!” Milim said incoherently.</p>
<p id="line_2348">—I see. Frey had been in charge of investigating and summarizing reports on different nations. She must have handed the data she collected to Milim in hopes of teaching her about ruling. But Milim escaped because of her dislike of it, that seemed to be the truth.</p>
<p id="line_2349">“I don’t care! I just want to join no matter what!”</p>
<p id="line_2350">I wasn’t able to say anything before Milim opened up first rejecting me. Very impressive, Milim’s instinct was exceptionally keen. Honestly, I should contact Frey or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> now—But, never mind, I guess.</p>
<p id="line_2351">I wouldn’t be the one getting scolded anyway. “I know nothing of this,” that’s how it will go.</p>
<p id="line_2352">Compared to that—something Milim had said made me very curious.</p>
<p id="line_2353">“All right! You are the one getting scolded anyway, so I’ll drop the matter. Let’s talk dragons, dragon! Just now you said something about capturing a dragon, right? Is that really possible?”</p>
<p id="line_2354">“Uh! So I will get scolded indeed? No, but… It can’t be helped. As the saying goes, adventure always comes with risk…”</p>
<p id="line_2355">Milim was a like a kid who wasn’t scared about getting scolded for skipping classes and homework to play outside. Honestly, I couldn’t save her, this was the road she chose for herself. Standing by and observing was part of the duty as an adult.</p>
<p id="line_2356">After some internal struggle, Milim chose fun over work.</p>
<p id="line_2357">“You mean the dragons. They can be captured. Should I go find some?” she answered without hesitation and seemed to have switched up her mood. While saying it as if she was going to catch some beetles, she proposed we go catch some dragons.</p>
<p id="line_2358">That’s just what I needed right now.</p>
<p id="line_2359">“Uh, can I ask for that favor from you? If that’s the case, what types of dragons are out there? Are they related to the True Dragons?”</p>
<p id="line_2360">Since she wanted to help by catching some, of course I’d ask for this small favor. I bore such thoughts in mind while asking, to which Milim and Veldora both reacted.</p>
<p id="line_2361">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, dragons are different from ‘True Dragons.”’</p>
<p id="line_2362">“Right. It’s not as if you were <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it’s simply wrong for you to mix me up with those lizards!” the two objected strongly.</p>
<p id="line_2363">So as a follow up to the conversation, I inquired about the details of dragons.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2364">“—Basically, all of the dragon races in this world originated from my big bro, the strongest True Dragon, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Star King Dragon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Veldanava.

<p id="line_2365">Veldora began to explain in detail as our conversation proceeded. There was a basic but critical difference between the two kinds, that was the difference between material life form and spiritual life form. As a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the dragon possessed a physical body. It was only called a dragon due to its similar appearance to a True Dragon, but its nature was more akin to that of a dinosaur or in simpler terms, a giant, fierce lizard.</p>
<p id="line_2366">While it was said that there were in total four True Dragons in this world, right now only three remained. Veldora’s elder brother, Milim’s father <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Star King Dragon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Veldanava was destroyed due to <s>nutting in the wrong species</s> a certain reason and had shown no sign of being resurrected anytime soon.</p>
<p id="line_2367">True Dragons were immortal beings, however, people believed that there was more to that attribute…but anyhow, let’s put that aside for now.</p>
<p id="line_2368">The origin of dragons could be traced to this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Star King Dragon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, more precisely, it could be traced to the pet gifted to Milim by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Star King Dragon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Spirit Dragon (Elemental Dragon)<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="This is a case of katakana annotation confusion. Its annotation is “Elemental Dragon” when it’s called “Spirit Dragon” in Kanji. Will be referring to it as ‘Spirit Dragon’ to differentiated from 属性竜 (Elemental Dragon), which is a type of Arch Dragon." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>.</p>
<p id="line_2369">Comparing this to the story <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> told me, that Spirit Dragon was no doubt the deceased Chaos Dragon. Nowadays in regions with concentrated magicules, there seemed to be Lesser Dragons spawning and dragons who inherited more elements of Spirit Dragon became Greater Dragons (Arch Dragons).</p>
<p id="line_2370">In addition, there were also more powerful dragons among the Arch Dragons, they were the dragon lords that represented the four elements. After living hundreds of years after evolving to an Arch Dragon, and then having their wisdom increased even farther—these were the dragon lords. After evolving, they seemed able to utilize part of Spirit Dragon’s power and no longer aged as they grew older. They were nearly a semi-spiritual-life-form. But unlike True Dragons, once they were eliminated, they were dead for good.</p>
<p id="line_2371">I recalled that the sky dragon I beat was an Arch Dragon, its threat level was at Rank Calamity. Dragon lords are stronger than that, they could probably rival a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. In other words, perhaps they could compete with Clayman and Greater Spirits, or were perhaps even stronger than them.</p>
<p id="line_2372">If they had that large of a magicule pool, they should be able to easily gain control over the terrain effects of each floor.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2373">“Hold on, no matter how strong I am, I won’t be able to capture the mighty dragon lords!” Milim hurriedly exclaimed, afraid that I may have misunderstood.</p>
<p id="line_2374">If she said so then it must be the case. It would be impossible to tame dragon lords who possessed intelligence. We might persuade them by asking for a favor, but the problem we were facing this time didn’t require us to go quite that far.</p>
<p id="line_2375">“You have a point, then which ones are you catching?”</p>
<p id="line_2376">“Hmm! Although they cannot rival dragon lords, there are Arch Dragons who do possess elemental attributes. We will be catching and taming those guys and let them consume magicule and help change the terrain.”</p>
<p id="line_2377">I see. The dragons seemed to make their own nests, so they may modify their domain based on their needs.</p>
<p id="line_2378">All the necessary components had been prepared, and the magicule was filled to the brim. So I’d take Milim’s suggestion.</p>
<p id="line_2379">“Can I count on you?”</p>
<p id="line_2380">“Leave it to me! Some of the dragons with elemental attributes may soon evolve to dragon lords, so I’ll capture one for each element.”</p>
<p id="line_2381">According to Milim’s explanation, there were four elements that developed from the Spirit Dragon. For each element—the dragon lords of Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind were at the top of the food chain, followed by Elemental Dragons, forming a tree graph. There were four types of Elemental Dragons as well. They were the Fire Dragon, Ice Dragon, Wind Dragon, and Earth Dragon.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The kanji names sound a lot cooler; they are Dragon of Flame (火炎竜), Dragon of Frost (冰雪竜), Dragon of hurtling Wind (烈風竜), Dragon of Shattering-Earth (地碎竜)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> The sky dragon I beat seemed to have been a subspecies that failed to evolve into a Wind Dragon. Unlike spirits, they didn’t have the element of “Air.”</p>
<p id="line_2382">It was also said that there were mutated dragons and ones that received special evolution, in human’s words, they were called having (too much) personality.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2383">Anyhow, now we could expect levels with terrain effects. If Milim does catch the dragons, we should put them at lower levels. By the way, the Elemental Dragons were stronger than their non-elemental cousins. A rough estimation of their strength was around Special Rank A, a powerful species. Even though they couldn’t really compete with Charybdis, they were still very strong.</p>
<p id="line_2384">I didn’t put too much thought in it. But in fact, a normal dragon could already rival six <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, or it was said to be able at least. But Elemental Dragons, even sending out a whole squad of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s might not necessarily be able to eliminate it… Still that’s none of my business.</p>
<p id="line_2385">I’m not gonna care about that, but I’ve decided where to put my focus. The counters among the five main elements of spirits were as follows—Earth countered Air, Air countered Wind, Wind countered Water, Water countered Fire, Fire countered Earth. But the strength of Elemental Dragons didn’t seem to be affected by this countering effect.</p>
<p id="line_2386">Although the elements countered each other, combat experience seemed to be far more important. In simpler terms, an older dragon surpassed a younger dragon. So I could put them wherever I wanted.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2387"><b>Floor 99: Fiery Hellscape</b></p>
<p id="line_2388">The final level surrounded by scorching flames. You must wear heat-resisting equipment, but what could be awaiting ahead…?</p>
<p id="line_2389"><b>Floor 98: Icy Prison</b></p>
<p id="line_2390">Pause your footsteps and you will die. Will you make it with cold-resistant gear?</p>
<p id="line_2391"><b>Floor 97: Electric Skies</b></p>
<p id="line_2392">Thunder from the heavens is posing an omnipresent threat, whether you can overcome it will depend on your luck!</p>

<p id="line_2394">As if it is mocking the people arriving at the level, vicious earthquakes greet you. Behold the fury of dragons!</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2395">That’s about it.</p>
<p id="line_2396">Before they were able to fight the final boss Veldora, we would prepare these terrain effect levels with ultra-difficulty. Then there would be no problem at all. By any stretch of normal logic, there’s no way anyone could defeat all these.</p>
<p id="line_2397">“Nice job, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>
<p id="line_2398">“Kukuku, so you are deploying low-lives before me. After seeing those imposters, the adventurers will lower their guards, and it will be my time to shine!”</p>
<p id="line_2399">“Uh, it is so awesome to have someone like Veldora to play that type of character. I want to try and be the final boss sometimes!”</p>
<p id="line_2400">The three each had a point that made them satisfied. I was also very happy about it. The only thing was, these pivotal dragons had yet to arrive, so I hoped that we were not celebrating for nothing. Upon thinking so, I decided to coddle Milim a bit.</p>
<p id="line_2401">“What are you talking about, Milim. It is all thanks to you that we are able to complete this final trap!”</p>
<p id="line_2402">“!”</p>
<p id="line_2403">“That’s right, Milim! I’m relying on you this time as well, remember to catch some strong and handsome dragons and bring them here!”</p>
<p id="line_2404">“Hmm, count on me!”</p>
<p id="line_2405">Seemingly having noticed my intention, Ramiris joined in to assist my ploy. It appeared to have worked as Milim was suddenly bursting with motivation. Now I could rest assured for a while.</p>
<p id="line_2406">As long as we had dragons, the traps could be deployed smoothly. It was fine to not put any effects on these floors, because as soon as Milim captured the dragons to build their nests here, they would become ferocious traps themselves.</p>
<p id="line_2407">As a result Milim went out to catch some dragons, adding to Ramiris’s growing number of underlings.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2408">A few days had passed since the day when Milim suddenly showed up and left. The setting of traps had been completed, all we needed to do now was wait for Milim to return with the captured dragons.</p>
<p id="line_2409">“Ah, Beretta-san, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, thanks for your hard work.”</p>
<p id="line_2410">“There’s no such thing, all of these are for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama and Ramiris-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_2411">“Indeed. I also feel overjoyed to work for Ramiris-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_2412">Beretta was acting very humble as usual in his response. As for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, she had Ramiris sitting on her shoulder while looking thrilled. It looked like she’d be willing to take any command from her.</p>
<p id="line_2413">All right, now most of the things were completed—</p>
<p id="line_2414">“Right, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, these things have been left with me for a while.”</p>
<p id="line_2415">After saying so, Beretta displayed some unique-grade weapons and gear.</p>
<p id="line_2416">“This is…”</p>
<p id="line_2417">“These were liberated from a certain magic doll subordinate of Clayman. I didn’t have the chance to hand these to you then, but I think they will be quite suitable to be put in the treasure chests—”</p>
<p id="line_2418"><em>Oh oh, now that you mention it. It’s from that greatest masterpiece of Clayman or something like that, was it called Viola?</em></p>
<p id="line_2419">Viola was strapped with weapons all over its body, which Beretta had taken the entirety of as loot. He had offered them to me previously, which I refused, because the demand he gave was the permission to move here. At the time Beretta complied with my decision and brought those things home…</p>
<p id="line_2420">“Didn’t you offer them as gifts to Ramiris?”</p>
<p id="line_2421">Someone reacted to my doubts, not Beretta, but Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_2422">“Hehe! I figured that I couldn’t really use them, so I’m not really that interested. They are indeed very strong weapons, but they can’t be modified too much. But even so, we kept them in hopes that they may be useful one day, that’s the decision we made after I discussed it with Beretta!”</p>
<p id="line_2423">“Is this really okay? You should be able to make a lot of money by selling them.”</p>
<p id="line_2424">“It’s okay, it’s okay. Because I have a job to do now too! I’ll probably be collecting money in troves in the future, so why be so petty now! Besides, we get to have a place of residence by doing so too.”</p>
<p id="line_2425">In this way Ramiris offered the weapons and gear to me, to which I expressed my gratitude and decided to put them to good use.</p>
<p id="line_2426">So that’s how it went down. <em>Let’s get started with setting up the treasure chests and confirming the progress on the labyrinth</em>. We began by examining the condition of the dungeon starting at underground level 1.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2427">The initial level was just for testing out your skill. It was designed so that even rookies could proceed safely. The width of the hallways inside the labyrinth area was also very large, so structurally it wouldn’t easily cause people to get lost.</p>
<p id="line_2428">With that being said, four sides, each being 250 meters in length, was quite spacious. Investigating the hallways alone would be hard work and there wasn’t even much loot after walking all this time. This type of floor would likely lead to these situations. Having empty hallways alone probably wouldn’t attract any customers, but luckily there was a large number of weak <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> patrolling the area, so it shouldn’t be an issue. People could get magic ore from these <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and practical items from their corpses. There were still a lot of rewards.</p>
<p id="line_2429">This loot would be purchased by us. There wasn’t a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> branch in this town, and the nearest was the Blumund Branch, which would be too tiring for adventurers to reach, so I figured that our nation could buy it at a cheap price with a cost difference that canceled out the transportation expense. It seemed like a pretty good idea. I was going to discuss with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to ask him the favor of building a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> branch in our nation, which was also a good idea anyway. Until that was done, we’d adopt this method for the time being instead.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2430">Until underground level five, we are only making the labyrinth slightly more complex without any major changes.</p>
<p id="line_2431">However, the situation would become dire from level six onward. All sorts of traps would be lying in wait. With that being said, up until underground level nine there may be vicious traps, but no one should be killed by the traps alone. If these were skillful adventurers, they shouldn’t suffer too much.</p>
<p id="line_2432">If the difficulty were set too high, we wouldn’t get returning customers and we wouldn’t be able to negotiate anything with them then. That’s why the first nine levels were designed to be more beginner-friendly.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2433">Next up was the indispensable floor ten. That floor had a slightly stronger <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> placed in the room. This was the so-called boss level. By defeating the boss, the gate leading down to the lower floors would open.</p>

<p id="line_2436">That’s right, in fact up until level ten underground, I haven’t seen a single trace of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Although it has been ten days since Veldora released his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, there isn’t any sign of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> spawning.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2437">«Answer. Even while hiding his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> can sense the aura of individual “Veldora.” Deducing that no <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> dares to approach him.»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2438">Ah, I see.</p>
<p id="line_2439">“Veldora’s release of magicules seems to have helped spawn some <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but they seem to have sensed Veldora’s aura, making them too frightened to dare approach.”</p>
<p id="line_2440">“What! So that’s why… It’s no wonder that none of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the sealed cave showed up.”</p>
<p id="line_2441">After hearing my explanation, Veldora suddenly came to a realization. But weaker <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> couldn’t really endure the aura either, so that was probably the main reason.</p>
<p id="line_2442">“All right, just try to find one when you are available next time. I estimate to put at least a Rank B <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that is slightly strong on level ten.”</p>
<p id="line_2443">“Oh—got it. But if there isn’t any intelligent fellow, we shouldn’t add it to my servants. Just bring it to the room and put this collar on it!”</p>
<p id="line_2444">Since Ramiris had spoken, I decided to take the collar. It was said that by wearing it, one could revive an infinite amount of times, even without making a pact with Ramiris. Then there would be no need to find replacements once they were defeated, how useful.</p>
<p id="line_2445">“Oh oh, this is so convenient. It will save a lot of work.”</p>
<p id="line_2446">“Right? Anyhow, in this labyrinth, reality can be whatever I want!”</p>
<p id="line_2447">It was indeed the case as Ramiris put it. She could also change the ability given on each item, Ramiris’s skill was truly versatile. I once more lamented my inability to recreate her skill.</p>
<p id="line_2448">Now the problem with the bosses was resolved as well. Floor ten would only have the boss room, and it would be safe after defeating the boss. After this level, there would be a save point and the stairs leading to the lower levels, just these two.</p>
<p id="line_2449">Right, right, I can’t forget about the treasure chests. There was no trap in the treasure chest. The only difference was that we would be moderating the drop rate of weapons and gear. I estimated there to be hidden rooms after that floor, so I’d set up treasure chests with traps. And following level 20, there would even be fake treasure chests.</p>
<p id="line_2450"><em>This was somewhat distasteful, predatory one might say, but I suppose you could call that giving a sense of clarity and a reminder during the exploration of the labyrinth. When they experience it in the field, they should come and thank me instead.</em></p>
<p id="line_2451">It was not entirely a bad thing. The inside of the labyrinth was full of magicules, so the equipment might even become magic swords or magic spears after some time. Since they were getting such precious rewards, encountering danger should be expected. They wouldn’t die as long as they had a “Resurrection Bracelet “, so it would be more exciting to be cruel, and reasonably speaking, more interesting. I was really looking forward to what type of reaction the adventurers would give.</p>
<p id="line_2452">And like that, the inspection work for level ten was complete.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2453">“What should we do next? Should we create a facility to buy back the items obtained by people from the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or for them to deposit the items?”</p>
<p id="line_2454">“Hmm—do we really need that? Because, if we have that type of facility, ‘Return Whistle’ will not sell well.”</p>
<p id="line_2455">I suppose that’s right too. Ramiris’s comment was an on-point rebuttal. She did have a point. She was apparently quite perceptive when it came to money.</p>
<p id="line_2456">“Indeed, putting this type of facility on a level with a save point does make it meaningless. Should we perhaps pick the middle ones, to make levels ending in five be safe zones?”</p>
<p id="line_2457">“Hmm hmm, that should work!”</p>
<p id="line_2458">We should make them available for storing items looted by adventurers and selling healing potions among other items at high prices. Building a meal area would be nice too.</p>
<p id="line_2459">We didn’t have to put all these facilities on different floors, we just needed to make sure these floors all had access to the same location. This was so creating them would not take too much work. Maybe there were many who wanted to rest outside instead of inside?</p>
<p id="line_2460">Well, that depends. “Return Whistle” was an item for emergency usage, so it would be fine to sell it at a higher price.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2461">That part I could think about after the festival concluded.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2462">That’s about it, everyone was taking the opportunity to shoot their opinions at each other in the discussion while examining each floor. As such, we did a thorough check as we smoothly built up the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_2463">We later were able to finish confirming level 100, and the result was satisfying. Simply describing the completed labyrinth with the word vicious would not do it justice.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2464">«Based on the strength of average adventurers, labyrinth set with low-level <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> already poses sizable difficulty. In addition with cruel traps and high-level <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> spawned, it is significantly insufficient to describe it with the term viscous—»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2465"><em>Eh, what? I didn’t catch you clearly</em>. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei seemed to be quite baffled by it. But of course, it must’ve been me thinking too much.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2466">—Later I was going to have a profound experience that proved I wasn’t thinking too much at all.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2467">I decided to pick the bosses from among the spawned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but it turned out that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the labyrinth were already overcrowding it.</p>
<p id="line_2468">“W-What the hell—!” I shouted, but it was all too late. I went through a very hard time trying to adjust the difficulty, but I suppose I had it coming… Whatever, it didn’t matter if I had a problem with it. I would consider this as a minor miscalculation and quickly toss it to the back of my mind.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2469">Many things happened in between, the rest would be handled by Veldora and Ramiris who were fully motivated. The dragons caught by Milim had been placed in their respective levels, and the magicule concentration of each level had also been moderated. There were also the automatically spawned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who likely due to the deployment of dragons, were no longer so concentrated. After such influence, right now the bosses were only planned up to level 30, so I wouldn’t think too much over this.</p>
<p id="line_2470">On the surface, the construction of the colosseum was still underway, the speed at which its skeletal framework was proceeding was incredible. It should be able to catch up to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> after the snow melts. And as for this labyrinth that lay underground, it had become an amazing recreational facility that far exceeded my expectations. Even though people needed to purchase a “Resurrection Bracelet “ first before entering, as long as you had that, anyone would want to check it out at least once. I intended to make it our main attraction in the future to capitalize on its expected effects.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2471">There were still many ideas of mine awaiting to be carried out, but we would be done for now. We all wore an evil grin and looked at each other in agreement. With that, the preparation work for the labyrinth was concluded for now.</p>
<p id="line_2472">Though the preparation work for the festival was still going on, there were already some unfamiliar faces showing up in town. The snow was beginning to melt, and the visitors from all over the Jura Great Forests were arriving one by one to our nation.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2473">The prelude to our nation-founding festival was soon to be unveiled—</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" id="chapter-4" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/title_cards/chapter-4.png"/></div>
<p class="pagebreak" id="line_2474"></p>
<h1 class="ch-number">Chapter 4</h1>
<h1 class="ch-name">Reception Ceremony</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_2475">The labyrinth was nearly complete, so I ran back to the town. Veldora and Ramiris were still in the labyrinth. As for Milim, she’d help with the building process as well once she had caught enough dragons.</p>
<p id="line_2476">Speaking of which, was it really all right for her not to return to her nation?</p>
<p id="line_2477">—While these doubts crossed my mind, at the end of the day it was Milim who would get scolded, so she could do whatever she wanted.</p>
<p id="line_2478">The other three deemed their respective floors unsatisfactory after seeing the traps that I had set up.</p>
<p id="line_2479">Until floor 30, we couldn’t make the traps too harsh. On one hand, if the traps were too forgiving, we wouldn’t be able to properly mess with the visitors. On the other hand, setting all the traps to hard mode would cause the adventurers to lose their interest.</p>
<p id="line_2480">If they didn’t have a good time at the start, the number of customers would gradually decline. Based on these considerations, I set the traps myself for the first 50 levels. As for Veldora and Ramiris, I handed the lower levels for them to design. They must’ve been trying to come up with even more devious traps after seeing the evil traps I set when I was serious.</p>
<p id="line_2481">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it seems I’ve been mistaken. Apparently, traps are not to be set individually.”</p>
<p id="line_2482">“That’s not fair, I want to do one too!”</p>
<p id="line_2483">“Hmm. I focused too much on power, and it seems I didn’t pay much attention to making it easier for the traps to lure people in. I gotta be more serious with the arrangements in the future.”</p>
<p id="line_2484">Their comments on every single little thing was driving me nuts—I’m too lazy to care after all.</p>
<p id="line_2485">Floors 51 to 60 had been assigned to Ramiris, while Veldora got levels 61 to 70. As for Milim, she would be in charge of levels 96 to 99. These rooms would all have dragons, which would be the most difficult levels with the addition of terrain effects. I let them modify the floors to their heart’s content, fully aware that they might devolve into pure insanity, but right now the adventurers could only get to level 50, so there shouldn’t be any problem.</p>
<p id="line_2486"><em>If you’re curious, level 95 had been made into a shelter for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It would become a resting place in the future that provided expensive accommodation services. We’ll take a wait and see approach, so I’ll keep a mental note of this.</em></p>
<p id="line_2487">As for the remaining floors from levels 71 to 94, we’d see what we could do with them later. For now, we left them as they were. However, since there’s still a dense magicule content in that area, some <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> might end up spawning there. And as such, the rest of the work was handed to the trio who seemed to be more than happy to do the job.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2488">A few days passed.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2489">After avidly scanning the city, I noticed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party headed our direction. It seemed they had prepared and hurried their way over as soon as possible, as they arrived earlier than expected.</p>

I’ll be in your care from today onward!”</p>
<p id="line_2491">“Ayyy, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. You are finally here. Let me take you to your house first,” I welcomed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and brought him to his newly built estate that I ordered Rigurd to construct beforehand. The house was ready to be checked in anytime now due to his comprehensive preparations. He carried out all my orders without hesitation; how capable he is indeed. I should acquaint Rigurd and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sometime along the way. But though I said so, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had already been doing business with our nation for the healing potions for quite some time, so the two were already very familiar.</p>
<p id="line_2492">The chores would thus be delegated to the goblina guides and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s lackeys. I then visited Rigurd’s office with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2493">“Rigurd, excuse us.”</p>
<p id="line_2494">“Oh oh, isn’t this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama?! Even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san is here too. To what do I owe the occasion?”</p>
<p id="line_2495">Rigurd was probably very busy, yet he still welcomed us with utmost haste.</p>
<p id="line_2496">“I see it is Rigurd-dono; It’s been a while. Young master—I mean, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama—has always given me good care, so basically things went—”</p>
<p id="line_2497">Without me having to do anything, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> avidly began explaining.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2498">We moved to the guest room and immediately dove into the discussion. We first talked about the construction progress of the colosseum as well as the conditions of the inns in the southwest area. Next, we touched on the future plans for the stores that we planned to open up near the aforementioned colosseum. Finally, we brought up the recently constructed labyrinth designed to attract adventurers to our town<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="This is the part where I complain about my editors being fucking gaijin and self-interpreting the sources. But their feelings were hurt and removed my footnote, so I’m putting it down here again. Why am I complaining?

<p id="line_2499">“—That’s about it. While the preparations for the dungeon are all complete, we still need a little bit more time before we can call it finished. With that being said, however, as of right now there’re not many problems left with it. The colosseum is not yet finished, but the stage has been constructed. Moreover, only the VIP area needs to be extravagant. As for the commoner seating, we can just drape the staircases with sheets. If that doesn’t work, we can just turn it into a standing area.”</p>
<p id="line_2500">We didn’t have enough time, so we’d save the work for the original standing area for later. The exterior of the building had yet to be decorated, so we would have to wait until Mildo returned. But since we’d been meticulous about the security, even with the construction itself being only half-way complete, the colosseum had the necessary stylistic elements of a building.</p>
<p id="line_2501">Rigurd and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> listened to my words, enraptured. The three of us then began to plan enthusiastically.</p>
<p id="line_2502">Rigurd raised the issue about how to deal with foreigners visiting our nation. He also vowed to properly educate the residents of the town by then. As for the martial tournament and the dungeon, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had planned out how the events was to unfold. He had been brainstorming a lot of ideas after my visit, so he was quite confident about it. After he finished speaking, he put on a proud smile.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2503">Later on, we helped to check for any flaws in each other’s plans. We also reflected on our own plans to see what else needed to be done in advance.</p>
<p id="line_2504">“With the addition of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san into the equation, our little undertaking just got wings,” Rigurd commented, smiling.</p>

<p id="line_2506">I told him that I intended to appoint <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to be in charge of the Financial Department. In addition, he would also be managing the Commercial and Advertising Department. I hoped he would do his part for this nation.</p>
<p id="line_2507">Rigurd didn’t seem to have any qualms about this, promising that he would be selecting candidates to become <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s subordinates.</p>
<p id="line_2508">Thanks to Vesta, the literacy rate here had increased across the board. But even in spite of that, not everyone was capable of reading, writing, and counting. Our country would continue to grow in the future, so talented individuals such as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were of great necessity. Rigurd probably understood this as well and was not simply blindly tagging along with my proposal merely because I wished for it. That’s why he himself also supported <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s appointment as an official of our nation.

<p id="line_2510">“No no no, I’m not that good yet.

<p id="line_2511">“But I will still need to show some results first, or else the others may not approve.”</p>
<p id="line_2512">“Indeed. Although if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama gives the order, everyone will obey regardless…”</p>
<p id="line_2513">“I don’t want to do that at all. Honestly, I think that I’ve been interfering too much in this whole thing already.”</p>
<p id="line_2514">“That’s right. A non-citizen of our nation becoming an executive, this matter alone will have a very good publicity effect. But in order to achieve that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san has to make some outstanding achievement.”</p>
<p id="line_2515">“That’s right. Although I feel pretty bad asking so much from you, will you be willing to try to accomplish that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_2516">Indeed, that’s where the difficulties lay.</p>
<p id="line_2517">With the only criteria being capability, gaining approval from the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> became a trivial task. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a good example of this. When he wanted to be my No.2 secretary, no one had any objections. More accurately speaking, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> objected, but that was more because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was an airhead. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s strength was comparable to mine; that was an undoubted fact. No one dared to complain about the actions of such a dangerous person. That’s why for my military officers, as long as I’d acknowledged them, they could become an executive. It was all fair game as long as they were strong enough.</p>
<p id="line_2518">But the same couldn’t be said for civil officials. They were supposed to be recruited through examinations, but sadly we had yet to develop to that stage. People with prior experience such as Vesta were obviously welcomed, but they would still need to show actual results. After all, even Vesta was still just a consultant, in other words, he was considered as a guest.</p>
<p id="line_2519">I thought it was about time to promote Vesta to an executive too, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> still needed to show some actual results.

<p id="line_2524">“Although there may be failures along the way, I see that you still wish to boast about your future success.

<p id="line_2525">“Hold on, hold on, Rigurd-san? You can’t do that!

<p id="line_2526">“Please be assured, I won’t leave any evidence—”</p>
<p id="line_2527">“Ah, geez, Rigurd-san is so scary.”</p>
<p id="line_2528">“I’ll be counting on you then. I am <em>really</em> going to turn a blind eye to you.”</p>
<p id="line_2529">Although this is what we said, both of us had evil grins on our faces.

This fact alone was very comforting. At the end of the day, as long as everyone could accept <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, any justification goes.</p>
<p id="line_2530">And so we chatted amicably until the meeting concluded, with everyone leaving behind their closing thoughts. Afterwards, we began the preparation for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2531">As such, the preparation work was proceeding bit by bit—</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2532">Fast forward to tonight.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2533">“How is this possible… How can this be?! This house is a thousand times more comfortable than the upper-class inns found in the capital of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> exclaimed the moment he moved into the new estate.</p>
<p id="line_2534">It seemed that he was highly satisfied with his new home, which pleased me as well.</p>
<p id="line_2535">“There’s tap water, a magic-powered stove, and a bathroom. There’s even a toilet here! It’s like every single facility from all the classy inns is present here.”</p>
<p id="line_2536"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was astounded after hearing the elated reports from his subordinates.</p>
<p id="line_2537">“Y-Young master…<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama? Is it really okay to be so extravagant?”</p>
<p id="line_2538">There’s no use asking me this, as this was the standard issue facility of this nation. But, since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s subordinates were staying at his place as well, his estate was a lot more luxurious than the average citizens’ indeed. I asked people to build a house with the same standards with references to the estate <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> resided in the Kingdom of Blumund. There were around ten rooms in total and some of them came with mini kitchens and toilets. There was also a large bathroom and canteen for communal use. Structurally it should accommodate a large number of residents.</p>
<p id="line_2539">“Is there such a need? It is a lot cheaper than preparing a home for everyone after all. Those who want to own their own house should start saving up right now to buy one in the future.”</p>
<p id="line_2540">I couldn’t manage to prepare a home for everyone, so I used the house exclusive to the executives instead. It’s great to see that everyone was satisfied. I’d be covering the expenses, of course. I did this in consideration of the fact that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had assisted me in making profits, so surely, we would continue to collaborate in the future as well. With this in mind, I’d just consider this a necessary expense. Compared to the potential profits, the cost of covering his housing was quite insignificant.</p>
<p id="line_2541">“I-I see… In this kingdom, this is the standard issue? Then, do the cheap inns in the southwest area also have this standard?”</p>
<p id="line_2542">“They do. Although not every room has a bathroom, they are built with toilets. After all, there are large, cheap bathhouses nearby. Some inns even have free-to-use bathhouses.”</p>
<p id="line_2543">“I see… I recall during the discussion at the start of all this, didn’t you mention that you intended to make this city a spa resort? Now I finally understand, Not only are these amenities exclusive to the wealthy, but even the inn service for commoners has reached this level. It’s no wonder why the adventurers keep coming back.”</p>
<p id="line_2544">“Isn’t this living environment too comfortable?”</p>
<p id="line_2545">“That’s not just comfortable, compared to the entire western continent, the lodging here is the pinnacle of luxury. Now with a stable income from adventurers, this country surely will prosper as time goes on—”</p>
<p id="line_2546">“Hmmhmm.”</p>
<p id="line_2547">“…!

<p id="line_2550">“That’s why you are building the dungeon! As expected of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I am completely vanquished against your peerless intellect.”</p>
<p id="line_2551">“Oh, oh ho, yeah that’s right.”</p>
<p id="line_2552"><em>What are you on about?</em></p>
<p id="line_2553">“Adventurers will come to hunt the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that spawn in the labyrinth. I originally thought that you were doing this to give them relief after they’ve lost their jobs as the Jura Great Forest became safe… Ah, how impressive, I’ve not expected you to think so far—”</p>
<p id="line_2554"><em>Giving relief? What now? Hold on, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the Jura Great Forest did decrease but… The dungeon is just intended to be a purely recreational facility—</em></p>
<p id="line_2555">“That will work, that will definitely work!

As a result, there are probably people who will choose the dungeon as an occupation. We can also sell equipment and healing potions as such. We will not only be able to make this a health resort for tourism, but some may even start settling down in this nation. All the inns provide wonderful services and there’s also the tourist attraction of the colosseum. In addition to meeting the demands for recreational and occupational needs…”</p>
<p id="line_2556"><em>I mean—is this the purpose of building the labyrinth?</em></p>
<p id="line_2557"><em>I do intend to buy up the items that the adventurers collect, but that is essentially somewhat similar to buying back the little trinkets you earn in a carnival game</em><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="In Japan gambling with money is illegal but winning little toys and other worthless trinkets is fine.

<p id="line_2558">“You’ve only just arrived today, yet you already have such a solid grasp on the situation, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_2559">“That is only natural. I’m confident that my ability to sense business opportunities will not lose to you.”</p>
<p id="line_2560">“Hehehe, I have truly been defeated, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_2561">“Hahaha, surely you jest. It is all thanks to young master that I am like this.”</p>
<p id="line_2562">“I’m not as confident in taking care of all this alone, that’s why I wanted to have you handle the project—”</p>
<p id="line_2563">“Oh oh, is that true? I’m happy to help.”</p>
<p id="line_2564">The plan to turn the dungeon into a workplace for the adventurers—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> joyfully accepted. He now had a huge workload on his shoulders, but man is he energetic. How capable.</p>
<p id="line_2565">I had never considered the possibility of having adventurers settle down here until <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> pointed it out. While some people might think they could earn a profit through the labyrinth, most would just spend their money and leave—this recreational facility had somewhat of a gambling factor.</p>
<p id="line_2566"><em>I see, so the idea is to have the adventurers settle down and let them hunt the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the labyrinth. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sure is astute, and he has an interesting way of looking at things.</em></p>
<p id="line_2567">Unlike the animal inhabitants, having the adventurers stay here would not disturb the ecosystem of the forest. In fact, we did need their help to clear the labyrinth before the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> started running rampant. It would also give us time to buy and prepare the necessary ingredients. There was no issue with the replenishment of magicules with Veldora present. In other words, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would start to gradually fill in.</p>
<p id="line_2568">This may turn out to be an amazing project. Adventurers would earn some money first before spending it in the town. Not only would we be able to line our own pockets, but we would also be able to support the adventurers.</p>
<p id="line_2569">The bought-back materials could then be processed and exported to other countries. As for the magic ores, we might even export them directly. We might need some of the magic ores though, so we didn’t really need to export them all at once. Moreover, it might help if the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> came to set up a branch in our nation. When that time comes, to avoid cut-throat competition, we’d need to loosen our stranglehold to prevent boycott. If the association payed the adventurers, it would help us to acquire foreign goods.</p>

That’s why we’d need to import things from other countries. Even if that weren’t the case, it would still be fine as I planned to turn my kingdom into a trading powerhouse.

<p id="line_2686">Not only that, but they also prepared several different types of outfits for each day. In the worst-case scenario, they would be changing my outfit every morning, noon, and night. I really hoped that they would show some restraint, but these people claimed that it was vital to make me look majestic… In other words, they were basically saying that the natural me—in slime form—had no majesty at all.</p>
<p id="line_2687">Right, never mind then.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2688">As for the people attending the reception ceremony, everyone would be dressed like guards of honor. They were all fully armed, and unlike when they wear their normal clothes, their current attire held an air of prestige.

<p id="line_2689">They told me that all I needed to do was remain silent and gaze down at the envoys. Since the magic of my appearance would be broken once I spoke, this suggestion was most appreciated.</p>

They seemed to express regret at the fact that they wouldn’t have a chance to see me in my “majestic” outfit.

When the two return, I shall make sure to reward them properly.</p>
<p id="line_2694">I wasn’t the only one who had been working hard. Although my current state was extremely embarrassing, I’d have to endure it. I got the feeling that I should finish this reception ceremony as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2695">The most interesting thing honestly was the reaction of the different tribes. While I served the role as a very “competent” decorative object with nothing else to do, I focused on observing the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> coming to greet me—there were three types of reactions they were giving.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2696">Reverence, observation, and fear.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2697">In addition, among the people who were observing me, some even seemed to look down on us. It was an attitude often displayed by the newcomers from the opposite side of the Ameld river. It’s not that big of a deal, and as long as I could show my strength, they would surely submit on the spot.</p>
<p id="line_2698">The problem lay with those who were afraid…</p>
<p id="line_2699">Right before me were people from a certain weak tribe whose expressions were filled with fear—the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="rabbitman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> tribe. They were cute looking demi-humans whose appearances closely resembled that of a human’s, with the exception of their elongated, rabbit-like ears. Unlike the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="rabbitmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were an inferior species that couldn’t use ‘Transformation.’ Their strength was no different from that of an average human, and judging from their equipment, they might even be considered weaker. But they still somehow managed to survive in the Jura Great Forest. It seemed that their ‘Danger Perception’ had been greatly enhanced, which was probably the reason why they weren’t fooled by my appearance.</p>
<p id="line_2700">Dealing with people who feared me was most difficult. Some were even panicking. The priority here should be to calm them down first.</p>
<p id="line_2701">“T-Today…a-an honor to be invited—”</p>
<p id="line_2702">They were apparently so nervous that it gave them trouble speaking…</p>
<p id="line_2703">“It’s fine. I permit you to meet with our ruler, the great <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. Please raise your head!” Rigurd spoke up, yet the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="rabbitman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> representative remained unresponsive. Actually, he didn’t seem to be moving at all. Even with my cute slime appearance, he still didn’t dare to raise his head to look at me. Meh. But I guess it was true that he couldn’t make eye contact with me anyways since I didn’t have any in the first place.</p>
<p id="line_2704"><em>Uh, maybe I’m stretching the topic. I don’t intend to rule over others with fear, so I hope this misunderstanding can be resolved… However, to these people, the whole “This <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looks pretty weak”—is probably setting off every single one of their danger alarms.</em></p>
<p id="line_2705">So this was the so-called fear due to Gap Moe<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="This is an actual terminology. I cringed pretty hard when my editor pointed it out it was an actual thing (Cen note: this was present in Overlord LN as well.

Simply getting them to agree to cooperate with us on maintaining their domain and sharing their culture took quite a lot of effort. While this cooperation might be a little forced, I hoped that in the future they would come to trust us.</p>
<p id="line_2706">When the Federation was first formed, we had to deal with something similar regarding the halfling and kobold (doghead race) tribes. When I allowed the kobold tribe to travel and do business with us, they began trusting us. Nowadays, their representative Kobe<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Previous volumes translate him also as “Coby.”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> had become a steadfast comrade, and we often exchanged profitable trade information.</p>
<p id="line_2707">Whether it was this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="rabbitman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> tribe or other weaker tribes—I would declare that all were equal under my rule. I didn’t want to imitate other <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s and their Social-Darwinist philosophy of “might makes right.” I’d have to repeatedly bring up this point to hammer it in. It would be difficult to gain their trust immediately, but that would be a task for the future.</p>
<p id="line_2708">It seemed that I had gotten lost in my thoughts while staring at their rabbit ears. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="rabbitmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> right now were all groveling on their knees with their heads bowed.</p>
<p id="line_2709">“There’s no need to be afraid. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama is a man of leniency. He has said that all who are willing to pledge their loyalty shall be equal before him. You can greet him with ease of mind.”</p>
<p id="line_2710">After Rigurd said that, the representative was finally willing to lift his face.</p>
<p id="line_2711">He seemed quite young and had a handsome appearance, but dark circles hung under his eyes. Is it because he was working too hard or is it because he was too nervous…</p>
<p id="line_2712">“G-Great <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, please grant us <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="rabbitmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> the permission to pledge our loyalty to you—”</p>
<p id="line_2713">I nodded with a “Hmm” as he finished.</p>
<p id="line_2714">My reaction seemed to have eased their tension a bit; the young man’s shoulders visibly sagged in relief.</p>
<p id="line_2715">“I’ve told you just now, there’s no need to be so nervous.”</p>
<p id="line_2716">“Y-Yes sir! I-In fact, I brought my daughter here too, but she was too excited when she reached the town, and by the time I realized it I’d already lost track of her…”</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_2718">“Hahaha, our town right now is alive and brimming with an atmosphere of festivity. She’s a young lady after all, so her curiosity is only natural.”</p>
<p id="line_2719">“Ahh, this is too embarrassing. My daughter is always giving me a headache as she would run off to different places as soon as I stopped paying attention. I was afraid that she would be an eyesore to your Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, so I wanted to keep her at the village, but she kept begging me to bring her along…”</p>
<p id="line_2720">The tribe chief, who was also the representative, must’ve been very concerned about the disappearance of his daughter. Although she wouldn’t run into any trouble in this town, he still seemed to be worried sick. I felt somewhat reassured to learn that I was not the source of his fear. I didn’t want any weak tribes to be fearful of me anymore.</p>
<p id="line_2721"><em>By the way, a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="rabbitman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> lady…a beauty with rabbit ears… I’ve got to meet her sometime.</em></p>
<p id="line_2722">While contemplating about the issue, I accidentally let out some of my genuine thoughts.</p>
<p id="line_2723">“Since she is so naturally curious, wouldn’t she also be able to adapt to times of turbulence and change as well? She seems to show promise in growing to be a reliable successor.”</p>
<p id="line_2724">Due to the fact that I personally spoke to him, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="rabbitman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> representative looked deeply moved.</p>
<p id="line_2725">“Thank you for your gracious kindness.

<p id="line_2726">The chief bowed his head, which seemed to indicate that the awkward situation had been resolved.

The chief bowed to me several times before he and his people departed off into the distance.

<p class="space-break" id="line_2727">After being guided out, the next batch of visitors arrived.</p>

<p id="line_2753">Rigurd knew his stuff, all right. Unlike <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he had completely understood the meaning behind my words. After Rigurd pointed this out, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to have finally understood the situation.

<p class="space-break" id="line_2754">Next in line were the chiefs of each high orc clan who came to greet me with several subordinates. They must have put a lot of faith in us seeing that they didn’t even bring any guards.</p>
<p id="line_2755">The subordinates were their children. The improvement in the food shortage situation was only natural, and even their lives as a whole had been improved.</p>
<p id="line_2756">The most important thing, for them, was the birth of new children. Rumor had it that the fact that the newborns were also high orcs upon birth gave them a pleasant surprise, which is why they decided to report this to me in person.</p>
<p id="line_2757"><em>Isn’t it normal for the high orcs to have high orc children?</em> I thought so too, but it turned out to not be the case. Under normal circumstances, the high orcs would only give birth to regular orc children; the mutation was only limited to one generation. Due to the declining birth rate, they must’ve been putting more effort into raising their young. I hoped that this was indeed the case as more children would lead to more future labor for our nation.</p>
<p id="line_2758"><em>Children are precious. Even in a different world, with a different race, this is still the unwavering truth</em>. I was somewhat worried about the name inheritance, but it sounded like things went surprisingly well. Even though the names I gave them were randomly made up, and they had now gotten a bit complex… But they seemed to think that those types of names were perfectly normal.</p>
<p id="line_2759">Wonderful, wonderful.</p>
<p id="line_2760">While I believed this to be the case, it might just be that they had gotten used to their names. After being addressed with these names all the time, it naturally became the norm. They never had a problem with being unnamed in the past, so it seemed like I was worrying too much.</p>
<p id="line_2761">I heaved a sigh of relief and ended the reception ceremony with the high orcs.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2762">Finally the last group of people for today. Apart from the lizardmen and high orcs, there was one last major faction of the Jura Great Forest left—the treants<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="DnD race of essentially “Tree People”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> had also come to greet me.</p>
<p id="line_2763">With that being said however, the only people who were actually here were <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s two sisters, the dryads <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Trya" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Doris. But since the treants were immobile, this couldn’t really be helped. Moreover, the dryads were the representatives of tree people anyways, so it didn’t really matter that they weren’t personally present.</p>
<p id="line_2764">Speaking of the tribe of the treants, I often visited the place since Zegion and Apito guarded them. Not only did they guard the tribe, but they also delivered high quality honey to me. It was probably due to these reasons that the reception atmosphere was pretty relaxed.</p>
<p id="line_2765">“It’s been a while, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama.

<p id="line_2766">“Please continue to protect us in the future.”</p>
<p id="line_2767">The two weren’t holding back either as they greeted me with all smiles. This was good for me as well. We began to chat about our recent conditions, and so far, there didn’t seem to be any major problems at hand. If anything, the magicule density in the Jura Great Forest had thinned out, and as a result, movement had become somewhat more inconvenient.</p>
<p id="line_2768">It was as if the two were made from the same mold that birthed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. They exuded the usual aura characteristic of an abundance of powerful mana. But the reduction of magicule concentration did still have an effect on them. In fact, the body of this Doris in front of me had become more transparent.</p>
<p id="line_2769">“I see…that part is my miscalculation. It’s probably because of the ‘Barrier’ applied on the roads. I gotta figure out a solution…”</p>
<p id="line_2770">“Ah, it’s fine. It’s not that big of a deal.”</p>
<p id="line_2771">“It’s just that us sisters are affected because we utilize ‘Magic Body’ made by magicules that are susceptible to environmental changes.”</p>
<p id="line_2772">“Speaking of which, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama—”</p>
<p id="line_2773">“We have some urgent matters!”</p>
<p id="line_2774">They claimed that the reduction in magicule concentration was nothing significant.</p>
<p id="line_2775"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> being affected by the thinning of magicule density was very rare, but the dryads, who fed off magicules, mainly had their lives tied to the treants. Since they were the last group of people I planned to meet for the day, I decided on a change of venue to continue our discussion.</p>
<p id="line_2776">I arranged another place to meet them that evening…</p>
<p id="line_2777">………</p>
<p id="line_2778">……</p>
<p id="line_2779">…</p>
<p id="line_2780">It was nighttime, and as soon as I entered the room—</p>
<p id="line_2781">“The thing that we really wanted to discuss was—”</p>
<p id="line_2782">“We want to follow nee-san’s footsteps to serve the beautiful fairy queen.”</p>
<p id="line_2783">The two spoke at the same time. At this point, my mind was still stuck on the title “Fairy Queen.” That’s quite the dramatic name that didn’t suit that chibi at all. Also, the term beautiful was just…</p>
<p id="line_2784">Ramiris’s innocent smile crossed my mind. No way; there’s no such thing.</p>
<p id="line_2785"><em>My impression of her, compared to those two’s, couldn’t have been more different; that I am absolutely certain of. If Ramiris is considered beautiful, then my appearance that resembles Shizu-san can only be described as godly. Even though I’ve begun to get used to looking at it lately, I still occasionally get mesmerized when looking at myself.</em></p>
<p id="line_2786">Not only me, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> by my side also shared the same sentiments. However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Trya" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Doris seemed oblivious about it.</p>
<p id="line_2787">“It isn’t just our hope, it’s what all the treants desire as well.”</p>
<p id="line_2788">“We heard that this town—”</p>
<p id="line_2789">“Ramiris-sama has moved and settled here.”</p>
<p id="line_2790">“If that’s the case, we hope to contribute our fair share of effort in serving her Majesty…” the two talked in turns, either about following my leadership or about serving Ramiris. How could I take these people as subordinates when they were shouting about pledging loyalty to someone else? Seriously. Well, I guess since their sister <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was already serving Ramiris, I didn’t really have any reason to object.</p>
<p id="line_2791">“Then, would you guys want to ask her directly in person?”</p>
<p id="line_2792">“—EH?”</p>
<p id="line_2793">“Can we really?”</p>
<p id="line_2794">The two reacted quite enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2795">As such, we walked together to where Ramiris was. Beretta was working quietly on something while <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was busy tending to Ramiris. Ah, Beretta seemed to be buried beneath a mountain of work.</p>
<p id="line_2796">I thought to myself, while on the other hand—</p>
<p id="line_2797">“AH! Ramiris-sama is indeed beautiful—”</p>
<p id="line_2798">“She is beautiful and noble as always. There is indeed no other who could be our master!”</p>
<p id="line_2799">They were just like this before, and as soon as they saw Ramiris, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Trya" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Doris went full fangirl and began to cry out in excitement.</p>
<p id="line_2800"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san saw this and nodded in acknowledgement. Who were these people talking about? I was completely baffled. Especially the part about “noble quality.” Because no matter how you put it, Ramiris seemed to be quite lacking in that regard.</p>
<p id="line_2801">“Did you hear that? Hey! I’m talking to you, you know! Didn’t you hear what they just said? Are you going to see me in a different light now?”</p>
<p id="line_2802">I saw that Ramiris was once again being cocky and acting boastful.</p>
<p id="line_2803">How troublesome. She was even flying around me looking all delighted, almost as if saying: “How ‘bout that!”</p>
<p id="line_2804">Never mind, I didn’t wanna deal with her anyways. It was indeed something to be happy about when you got praised…but she was seriously taking it way too far.</p>
<p id="line_2805">“How do you see it, Ramiris? Not only these two, but the entire tribe of treants wishes to serve you!”</p>
<p id="line_2806">“Uhmm, but…”</p>
<p id="line_2807">She seemed to be aware that she was a guest who was just temporarily staying here as she looked around, indecisive. That’s why I decided to lend her a hand.</p>
<p id="line_2808">“How about moving them into your labyrinth? Since you could move the shelter of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with ease, surely, it’ll be a piece of cake to move the treant tribe, right?”</p>
<p id="line_2809">Or perhaps it was too hard due to the distance involved? But I recalled that she mentioned something about the labyrinth being connected to all parts of the world…</p>
<p id="line_2810">“Can I? Then we’ll have them move in tomorrow! With the power of my mentor, expansion of the labyrinth is super easy! I feel like my power has increased as well. There are still empty floors right now, so perhaps it’ll be a great idea to turn one of them into a forest!”</p>
<p id="line_2811">Ramiris accepted my proposal with joy all over her face.</p>
<p id="line_2812">“With the power of her mentor”—that line kind of concerned me, but whatever, that’ll do.</p>
<p id="line_2813">“But we are residents of the Jura Great Forest, so shouldn’t we follow <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama…?”</p>
<p id="line_2814">Although, I still had some reservations about it. Even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san seemed to be concerned, though her facial expression said otherwise. I could tell that she wanted to live with her sisters as well.</p>
<p id="line_2815">As I stated several times: I personally didn’t object. In fact, the interior of the labyrinth was the domain of Ramiris. The region managed by me and the residence of Ramiris coexisted at the same time. This was the so-called special zone. It was why the area run by Ramiris inside the labyrinth could enjoy extraterritorial judiciary.</p>
<p id="line_2816">I explained the matter to them and told them that I wouldn’t hold them accountable for anything if they migrated now, since Ramiris’s subordinates were immortal inside the labyrinth. Moreover, I thought it best for them to serve their original master, so I suggested.</p>
<p id="line_2817">“We treants and dryads hope to move here and seek the protection of Ramiris-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_2818">“We know that this is sudden, but will you grant us your permission?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Trya" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Doris requested. And without a doubt, I granted permission.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2819">And just like that, the plan to move the treant tribe into Ramiris’ labyrinth had been approved. They’d live on floor 95, which was currently serving as the shelter for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. This dome-shaped floor was the largest of its kind, with a diameter spanning five kilometers, offering plenty of space. Another reason was that I was planning to make that level a resting zone anyway, and this just happened to help make things smoother. After all, we already had the so-called forest hot spring, so the resting area couldn’t be too shabby either.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2820">The issue concerning their migration was settled quickly. Ramiris went to where the treants lived and created a new labyrinth gate to directly move the entire tribe inside. Since the treants traveled exceedingly slowly, she opened up a gate in front of every individual treant in order to speed things along.</p>
<p id="line_2821">And with that, Ramiris got a bunch of new subordinates. They even helped to stabilize the interior of the labyrinth as well. Managing the magicule concentration and the air conditioning had also become easier… Not only that, but the treants seemed to also be content with their living conditions. The increased magicule concentration had made everyone livelier.</p>
<p id="line_2822">As for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who were temporarily residing there, they didn’t seem to care much about it either. The treants were all very well-behaved people, spending most of their time sleeping. In addition, they looked no different from normal trees, so it was no wonder why no one minded. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would have to return to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Eurazania" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> someday, so sharing their residence wouldn’t really bother them. With a more comfortable living environment, chances were high that they’d actually come to welcome the treants instead.</p>
<p id="line_2823">The dryads also agreed to work on managing the labyrinth. Well, I should say that they were more like volunteers instead of workers.</p>
<p id="line_2824">“We after all have the honor to build an amusement park here, so it is an easy task.”</p>
<p id="line_2825">Since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san put it that way, her sisters, and the rest of the dryads had no objections. Now we got some unexpected assistance.</p>
<p id="line_2826">………</p>
<p id="line_2827">……</p>
<p id="line_2828">…</p>
<p id="line_2829">And so, a small forest had been added inside the labyrinth.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2830">Floor 95 ended in a five, making it a safe zone. Plus, we still had some empty floors left, so we turned levels 91 to 94 into warehouses, flower beds, or processing factories. To be more specific, level 91 would be a warehouse for iron ore, level 92 the manufacturing factory that refined the ore to magisteel, level 93 the flower beds, and level 94 would be the honey processing plant.</p>
<p id="line_2831">Anyone from level 95 could directly reach these floors with ease due to convenient transportation. There was a save point in the center, adjacent to it were gates that lead to different floors as well as stairs to go to lower levels. It was thanks to the fact that the labyrinth completely negated the laws of physics that we got such a convenient structure.</p>
<p id="line_2832">As soon as someone defeated the boss at level 90, the stairs to level 95 would immediately appear. We all agreed that there was no harm in letting the people that had made it to that point take a little shortcut if they so desired.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2833">After which—</p>
<p id="line_2834">From floor 96 onwards was a grueling series of the most challenging, hellish levels. Before attempting them, adventurers needed to take a rest and inspect their equipment. We didn’t forget to set up gates and caution signs before the stairs leading to the lower levels. We also opened inns, as well as weapon and gear stores surrounding the gate. The inns had gates leading to all the safe zones. That made it very convenient in times like these.</p>
<p id="line_2835">Now let’s check out the stores selling weapons and gear. During their opening hours, the shops would only display the rare equipment exclusive to the labyrinth. I didn’t think we’d have too many customers, so they’d most likely become stores for the blacksmithing enthusiasts.</p>
<p id="line_2836"><em>Should I sneak one of my own works onto the shelf as well?</em> While daydreaming about this, I decided to discuss the plan with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And that’s how it was. After the end of today’s reception ceremony, I suddenly became the lil’ helper for Ramiris and her men to migrate.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2837">This floor would later become a forest city. Only people who had weathered through the trials of the dungeon would be able to gain access here and take a rest to receive some motivation, for further adventure of course—this so called “City of the Labyrinth” would become a prosperous city of fantasy.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2838">With that being said—at the time, I had not foreseen that at all.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2839">The next day.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2840">According to today’s schedule, we seemed to be starting off with stronger species. These were the most powerful bunch among the new-comers; therefore I could expect some more intense stares to be directed at me while being observed—as if on cue, there was already a commotion taking place outside.</p>
<p id="line_2841">Members of two different tribes showed signs of starting a conflict with each other. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> frowned unpleasantly at the sight while <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> widened her eyes, forcing herself to endure her anger.</p>
<p id="line_2842"><em>Geez, I hope things can be settled peacefully…</em></p>
<p id="line_2843">The people visiting were the ox-head (<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="gozu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>) and horse-face (<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mezu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>) tribes<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Gozu and Mezu are respectively referring to “Ox-head” and “Horse-face” which are both creatures from Japanese legends." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>. Both sides brought around ten young warriors who were already engaging in a standoff. It was said that both tribes had been engaged in perpetual battles against each other for over a hundred years without ever reaching a point of reconciliation.</p>
<p id="line_2844">The reason they were arguing this time was probably to determine who got to go in first for the reception. Perhaps they thought that whoever came first would get the upper hand, but I was determined to stay out of this mess no matter what. The day had barely started, and I’d already gotten a headache. With their relationship being this tense, I was honestly worried about them kicking off a brawl any moment. They attempted to pull each other back as they moved in front of me. Naturally for the high-ranked tribes in the Jura Great Forest, their strength was reflected in their arrogance.</p>
<p id="line_2845">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with ox horns was the first to speak.</p>
<p id="line_2846">“Yo, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, we are the ones that will be of real use on the battlefield!

<p id="line_2847">As expected from a race with impressive strength, not only was he not afraid of me, he even began to brag. Actually, compared to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> tribe and lizardmen tribe in the past, they did possess a higher magicule content. Just giving them a more careful look revealed that several of them were already at Rank A. It was no wonder that they were able to continue a war for as long as a hundred years. Based on combat capabilities alone, they may indeed have been the strongest in Jura Great Forest…</p>
<p id="line_2848">Before I could make any response, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mezu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began to shout angrily as well, “Hmph, bunch of fools!

<p id="line_2849">Both of them were spouting unreasonable nonsense and their type of explosive personality already had me frustrated. It seemed that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="rabbitmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who weren’t fooled by my appearance turned out to be more distinguished.</p>
<p id="line_2850"><em>But, hold on a sec?</em></p>
<p id="line_2851"><em>They are indeed irritating, but upon seeing these guys, an idea suddenly popped into my head. Honestly, whenever we think about a labyrinth, the first thing that comes to people’s mind should be “Minotaur.”</em></p>
<p id="line_2852"><em>In Greek mythology, there was a famous ox-head labyrinth <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> called the Minotaur—people thought that it was a legend or a fable passed on by generations, yet in the early twentieth century, they actually dug up the Knossos palace on the island Crete. The palace had a complex interior structure with its basement resembling a labyrinth.</em></p>
<p id="line_2853"><em>Anyway, putting aside whether the Minotaur actually existed or not, the palace was supposedly filled with various paintings depicting an ox—that’s how the Minotaur became the iconic staple of any self-respecting dungeon. It must be my lucky day, because the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="gozu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> race, resembling the Minotaur from people’s fantasies, is just the thing our labyrinth was lacking!</em></p>
<p id="line_2854">Upon seeing the giant creature that was likely their leader, <em>isn’t he a good candidate for that?</em> I thought to myself.</p>
<p id="line_2855">The weakest part of our dungeon was the selection of bosses. Right now we had only captured some rather impressive <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and placed them at levels 10, 20 and 30. This <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="gozu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> guy would be most suited to defend levels 40 to 50—that’s how I see it.</p>
<p id="line_2856">I would love to appoint him a boss on some floor—such thoughts continued to pour out of my mind. But reality is often disappointing. These <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t seem to have much loyalty towards me. At most they were thinking: “This guy could be a pretty good employer.” Moreover, their intention of using me to eliminate their rival was obvious. They could be of so much use if they just behaved themselves a little. Such were my honest opinions.</p>
<p id="line_2857">That’s why I decided to activate some of my ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord Haki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ I hoped that they would realize how strong I was and pledge their allegiance—eh, it flew over their heads completely. They continued to argue against each other right in front of me… Although it would be quite rude, should I perhaps dull their spirits a bit so I can recruit them?</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2858">I was just about to put that thought into action—</p>
<p id="line_2859">“You punks, how dare you act so rude in front of our king. I, Rigurd shall show you all your places!”</p>
<p id="line_2860">While flexing his muscles, Rigurd stepped forward. While he usually treated people kindly and actively attended to national affairs in town, I knew that he had been secretly working out. In fact, he had already outperformed youngsters such as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Rigur. He even volunteered himself for the fight against the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s—he clearly had an aggressive side. I was confident that he could beat the leaders of these two tribes.</p>
<p id="line_2861">“What did you just say? How can a mere civil official be so pompous!”</p>
<p id="line_2862">“You’re just a lackey of some weakling <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, quit bluffing now!”</p>
<p id="line_2863">The two leaders rebuked, the rest of the youngsters responding in a similar manner. They’d been underestimating me before as well, the only people to be so pompous were them. All I needed to do was release some of my ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord Haki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ and any <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who encountered me until now had obeyed nicely. These people however were clearly itching for a fight and totally lacked awareness of their situation.</p>
<p id="line_2864">Rather than fearing me, it was better that you looked down on me since it was easier to deal with that way. But I might have to reevaluate my policy now that they’d crossed the line. Surely, they would settle down once we roughed them up a bit.</p>
<p id="line_2865">Rigurd was looking at me. As I was about to grant him permission—</p>
<p id="line_2866">“What is that!”</p>
<p id="line_2867">“…This is…”</p>
<p id="line_2868">“—Geez, there seems to be something troublesome?”</p>
<p id="line_2869">“Hmph, it’s probably nothing.”</p>

<p id="line_2882">Upon arriving at the scene, there were around ten members from the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurenai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> surrounding the three men responsible.

Ah, Gobjay was there too. He seemed to have done his best, but running straight at these intruders was just reckless.</p>
<p id="line_2883">The people who weren’t injured were assisting the townsfolk and guests to take shelter. They had received training on how to handle emergencies, so things were going smoothly without stirring up too much chaos. The fact that anyone got hurt kind of pissed me off anyway.</p>
<p id="line_2884">I turned to the three culprits. One of them was a slim and tall, polite-looking man who wore an earring. There was also a brawny man with bulky muscles who wore a nose-ring. And the last one had quite a large build; he was a short and plump man who wore a mouth-ring. Their hairstyles were all very bizarre, each of them a different color. “Like delinquents with dyed hair”—that’s a rather appropriate metaphor for the trio.</p>

<p id="line_2943">I didn’t want any more trouble, so I decided to clarify the relations behind them. If they were willing to tell me honestly—I didn’t expect this concern of mine to be resolved as well.</p>

The youngsters who were brought along all imitated the leaders and bowed their heads on their knees. Their previous arrogance was gone without a trace, and they looked awfully powerless now as if they were some pathetic tribes from some backwater.</p>
<p id="line_2968">“W-We humbly await your Majesty’s return!”</p>

<p id="line_2970"><em>What type of emotional rollercoaster have you guys been through?</em> Their attitudes were completely different from before.</p>
<p id="line_2971">I returned to my throne and turned back to a slime. I thought that they were going to switch back to the conceited attitude, but there didn’t seem to be any sign of that.</p>
<p id="line_2972">“You guys serious?”</p>
<p id="line_2973">“O-Of course!”</p>
<p id="line_2974">“Please command us at will!”</p>
<p id="line_2975">It seemed that they had really changed their minds. They were trying very hard, seemingly to get on my good side from the bottom of their heart. I see. After witnessing the commotion just now, they must’ve found <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> quite terrifying.</p>
<p id="line_2976">Then there was no need to be courteous with these people. Now I could use them to whatever end I wanted. After all, they’d been fighting a war for over a hundred years and were troublesome tribes. They must’ve really enjoyed combat, if that were the case, surely, they would not complain to have the inside of the labyrinth as their battlefield. I heard that they would even rob weaker species and commit other bad deeds, so everyone would be happy if I quarantined these people.</p>
<p id="line_2977">“I see that you guys seem to be full of energy, how about I help you all prepare a stage to fight on.”</p>
<p id="line_2978">“Ehh, are you forgiving them?

<p id="line_2979">The commotion they just caused had been resolved like this, but Rigurd seemed to be dissatisfied. With that being said, since I had already taken in these people, I might as well give them the chance to work for me. It was better that way.</p>
<p id="line_2980">“Geez, don’t get mad, Rigurd. In my eyes these people were just being ignorant. So don’t fuss with them over this one incident. I’ll leave things in your care if these people underestimate me again.”</p>

<p id="line_2982">Fortunately, Rigurd seemed to have accepted it.</p>
<p id="line_2983">“Count yourself lucky today, if not for the commotions just now, not only Rigurd-san, I would have struck too.

<p class="space-break" id="line_2986">Seeing how unanimously they declared that, surely, they wouldn’t dare to defy us ever again.</p>
<p id="line_2987">“Since you’ve pledged allegiance to me, I can consider promoting you guys. But first you need to stop causing conflicts with others. You have to behave yourselves under my order.”</p>
<p id="line_2988">Although I wasn’t required to make this warning myself, this was my ultimatum for them.

I hoped this would continue until the end of the reception ceremony…</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2991">In front of me was the elder of the elven tribe—who appeared to be a youth in his prime no matter how I saw it—he also brought several servants. Not one of them was female, which was a pity since the elven females were usually beauties to behold.</p>
<p id="line_2992">Basically, the elves were a species with a long lifespan.</p>
<p id="line_2993">Spirits after becoming materialized—or perhaps fallen—would turn into fairies and possess a body. They were the ancestors of elves and dwarves. A Race such as the goblins were also distant relatives of ancient fairies.</p>
<p id="line_2994">The ones possessing “Earth” element became dwarves, “Water” element became mermaids, “Fire” element became goblins, and “Wind” element became elves. These were all results of crossbreeding between ancient fairies and other races that made up their ancestors.</p>
<p id="line_2995">The Goblins were the species with the thinnest bloodline which made their lifespan shortest. It was about the same for their evolved race of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Their lifespan was around a hundred years. Upon evolving to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="kijin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the power possessed by their spirit ancestors would be awakened. They then got to utilize powerful skills such as Psychic Power<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="神通力 I’m still not very sure what this power/ability the author is referring to, so I’ll adhere to the last volume and call this “psychic power” as I’ve seen such explanation in Japanese dictionary." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>.</p>
<p id="line_2996">Back to the topic of elves. It was said that they could live up to five hundred to eight hundred years. Even human half-breeds could still live for nearly three hundred years. Basically, the lifespan of each <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="elf" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> varied greatly in accordance to how much fairy blood flowed through their veins… They would not age any further after living twenty odd years into adulthood. Around twenty years before their natural lifespan expired, they rapidly began aging until the day they died.</p>
<p id="line_2997">They enjoyed hundreds of years of youth, which to humans made them appear like a fairytale species. Notable however was their low fertility rate, likely due to their longevity, they lacked the desire to pass on generations. As a result, they were few in number.</p>
<p id="line_2998">This was all the information I learned from the ladies at the Dwarven Kingdom night shop—Night Butterfly, although I wasn’t sure whether it’s true or not.</p>
<p id="line_2999">By the way, fairies still existed as their own species. They were not even rare, but in fact a very common type of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. They were about the same size as Ramiris and enjoyed pranks. They evolved from lesser spirits due to the influence of magicules. While they did possess intelligence, they were limited to one generation of descendants and had very short lifespans. While they were all fairies, these ones couldn’t rival those evolved (materialized) from greater spirits, so they were categorized as two different types of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3000">Some people often mixed Ramiris up with this type of fairy, but in reality, they were not the same creature. She fell from the high-ranked species of Spirit Queen, which was likely far more advanced than the ancestors of elves and dwarves. Ramiris apparently reincarnated a lot, so I probably couldn’t get an answer even if I asked her…</p>
<p id="line_3001">Ah, I went on a tangent.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3002">Let’s hear the elder’s greeting.</p>
<p id="line_3003">“We are honored to have you receive us. Today we’ve come for congratulations. Moreover, allow us to show our gratitude—“ the elder said with a salute.</p>
<p id="line_3004">Normally speaking, they would first greet me, then announce their allegiance to me. As for the people who had joined the Federation from the start, some of them would express appreciation due to my efforts in ensuring their safety and comfort in life. But this was the first time the elven elder and I had met each other. I felt somewhat estranged after hearing his thanks, so I asked Rigurd to inquire about it.</p>
<p id="line_3005">“Oh, that’s because—”</p>
<p id="line_3006">The elder claimed that it was related to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="gozu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mezu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> tribes. The two races had been fighting each other for over a hundred years, and it was said that the biggest victim of it were the elves.</p>
<p id="line_3007">The elder stated—</p>
<p id="line_3008">The elves relied on the resources of the forest to survive, to them the expansion of the warzone was an issue that concerned their livelihood. In order to prevent themselves from being harmed by external threats, the elves applied a disorienting ‘Barrier’ around their hidden residence. However, the war had damaged the forest—as the trees were chopped down the ‘Barrier’ was destroyed.</p>
<p id="line_3009">Without vegetation, trying to disorientate invaders was futile, which left their hidden residence completely exposed to the outside world. They managed to quickly relocate the tribe and were able to avoid the harm, but they didn’t expect the scale of war to gradually increase.</p>
<p id="line_3010">The war caused the animals and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of the forest to flee. Edible vegetables and fruits couldn’t be grown, and there were elves that ran off to seek jobs in the Dwarven Kingdom. Now that I thought about it, the elven ladies at Night Butterfly must have left their home for that reason to make a living working in foreign lands.</p>
<p id="line_3011">Later, due to the increased severity of the outflowing population, their residence became hard to maintain. They were forced to plan to move again, but given how large Jura Great Forest was, it was not easy to find a new location of residence.</p>
<p id="line_3012">“That’s why, we were hoping to report the matter to you so you may come up with a way to deal with those thugs. But before we could have made the request, your Majesty managed to make the judgement. Now all we need to do is to find a new place to move to—”</p>
<p id="line_3013">By then the people who had gone abroad for work would probably gradually return as well. These were the elder’s claims. Upon hearing his words, an idea popped up in my head—a new place to move to…that’s right, a place to move to indeed… We have that right here in our town!</p>
<p id="line_3014">The elven population was said to be no more than three hundred people. There were more of their race in ancient times, and back then they apparently also built a kingdom that prospered for a while. But their past glory was no more, the elves had become nomads that scattered all over the world. If they only had three hundred people, we did have a pretty good spot for them to move to.</p>
<p id="line_3015">Indeed, it was the mini forest we just finished building on level 95 of our dungeon. We just had to make them move there. As for their job assignment, we could make them assist Apito in raising bees and growing rare plants which could only be collected from forests with high magicule concentration. Or we could have them assist management in the planned inns on level 95. We could also invite them to manage the weapon shops. Moreover, though I didn’t think such a thing would happen, but if there were ever <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on level 95, it would be more reassuring with elves to protect the village. I heard that they got along really well with the treants, so <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san and the others shouldn’t object.</p>
<p id="line_3016">There was tons of work over there to do, they could also use this opportunity to call back the scattered tribesmen from around the world. <em>Perhaps those girls making money abroad will return too. By that time, will the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="elf" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Club for special members only no longer just be a dream—?</em></p>
<p id="line_3017"><em>Amazing, this is amazing.</em></p>
<p id="line_3018">There were bars in our town too, except that they served as restaurants as well. Doing it this way was most suitable for the adventurers. When I wanted to enjoy a drink in peace however, that only left me with the executive’s restaurant to go to.</p>
<p id="line_3019"><em>I could always ask <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to help me prepare drinks in my own room, but I’m not that desperate for a drink.</em></p>
<p id="line_3020"><em>I just want…just want to catch a breath sometimes.

<p id="line_3021"><em>—Seriously no, I’m telling the truth!</em></p>
<p id="line_3022">If we had a shop like Night Butterfly, I would be able to find venues for all sorts of things. But that’s just an idea. Seeing that the elven elder looked rather confused, I decided to raise the idea and give it a go.</p>
<p id="line_3023">“Chief, I’ve got a suitable place for you to move to—”</p>
<p id="line_3024">Due to me speaking up personally, Rigurd stepped back to be a listener. Perhaps he had found the time to train, no matter what situation he ran into, he was always able to respond without a sweat. Even if I slid off onto another tangent, he would probably help to round things out perfectly. How reliable.</p>
<p id="line_3025">“Oh, OHOH! Is that true, your Majesty?”</p>
<p id="line_3026">“Hmm. Since there are just three hundred of you, we can take in all of your tribesmen.”</p>
<p id="line_3027">“Thank you! Then please wait for me to return and bring all the tribesmen together to meet you.”</p>
<p id="line_3028">“Got it. Before you return, I will also modify the living environment to accommodate your residence. But I have some work that I want you to handle, is that all right?”</p>
<p id="line_3029">“There’s certainly no problem. If us elves can contribute for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> your Majesty, it will be our greatest fortune.”</p>
<p id="line_3030">The elven elder was happier than I expected. He must have gotten a huge burden off his chest now that they didn’t need to worry about roaming in the dangerous forest in search for a place of residence. He immediately sent men back to have the tribesmen prepare for the move.</p>
<p id="line_3031">That’s how we decided to allow the elves to move into the labyrinth. It would be fine if things just concluded like this, but the elder brought up something that concerned me. He mentioned that many people who had gone out to earn money recently had not returned. He also added that the elven race was very united and that he didn’t think these people would abandon their hometown like this…</p>
<p id="line_3032">There were even cases of people not returning after going out to hunt <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, which concerned him greatly.</p>
<p id="line_3033">But it might just have been due to elves’ keen inclination towards the idea of individualism, so perhaps they suddenly had the urge to leave, as the elder put it—this suddenly reminded me of something, it’s what I overheard at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s shop. Viscount Kazak of the kingdom of Blumund once went to discuss business with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I recalled that he mentioned opening a store that would use elven slaves…</p>
<p id="line_3034">Some of the elven youths had not returned for long. Their disappearance seemed to be linked to Viscount Kazak who got hold of elven slaves—actually, linked to some criminal organization. If this ominous prediction of mine was true…</p>
<p id="line_3035">Hopefully, I was just worrying too much, or else the problem would be severe.</p>
<p id="line_3036">I went so far as to push forward my dream of opening an <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="elf" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Club, but it seemed to be necessary to thoroughly investigate this situation first.</p>
<p id="line_3037">I bid the elven elder farewell who thanked me and was about to leave as I contemplated in heart. Then through ‘Thought Communication,’ I commanded <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who was awaiting orders behind me.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_3041">That should do it. Hopefully before the end of the reception ceremony, I could more or less get hold of some information.

<p id="line_3048">I definitely couldn’t get careless. It was imaginable that this would be the toughest reception yet. That’s why today I had all of the executives present to participate in the ceremony.</p>
<p id="line_3049">As for these VIPs, I had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> working on welcoming them. The fact that my right-hand man <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> took the task—from that alone you should realize how important this tribe was.</p>
<p id="line_3050">A heated aura like burning fire gradually approached outside the entrance. It seemed that the rumor was true. As the door opened, a group of armed militias entered. They were—the race that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> visited in person as an envoy.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3051">The tengu race.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3052">They resided on the Coscia mountain at the border of Jura Great Forest, an independent faction outside of my territory. Technically speaking, this was no reception, it was more like a conference. The armed militia arrived at the reception hall. Their leader was a beautiful young girl.</p>
<p id="line_3053">I thought that they were called tengu because they had long noses<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The kanji Fuse used for tengu is “長鼻族” which means “The race with long nose” and is why Rimuru thinks they have long nose.

The tengu race was the heavenly dog (tengu), in simpler terms, they were the mixed race between angels and mountain wolves (Okami)—</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3054">«Notice. The correct term is not mixed race. The angel race incarnated into the bodies of mountain wolf race to have formed this race.»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3055">Oh yeah, they seemed to be a race originated from incarnation.</p>
<p id="line_3056">The mountain wolves were a type of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they were born to be lonesome and prideful. Their name Okami (Mountain Wolf) has the same pronunciation as “Great God.” And so the name “tengu” had become a metaphor for “Person with extraordinary sense of smell.” By the way, about this race that seemed to be worshipped as mountain deities—</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3057">«Notice. Correctly speaking it is not the race that is worshipped. It is like individual “Ranga” who due to his “Individual” ability caused him to be categorized into the subgroup of deity.»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3058">—Right right.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3059">I was actually completely out of the loop on the whole thing, but basically these were mountain wolves who were born as deities that were crazy strong. Due to the incarnation of angels using their flesh, they were able to give birth to the tengu race that retained their personal will.</p>
<p id="line_3060">That powerful individual was the biological parent of this young girl in front of me, the elder of the tengu race. This elder’s power had declined greatly due to the birth of said child. It was for this reason that this young girl had become the chief of the tengu tribe.</p>
<p id="line_3061">Since we shouldn’t call this a reception, it was more appropriate to call it a conference. Moreover, there’s something more important—</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_3066">They were kind enough to have allowed the high orcs to move over to their region, but in reality, this race was extremely prideful.

<p id="line_3077">This girl, unlike the other tengu tribesmen, looked fairly similar to humans. Her pure white hair reached her shoulder, with the hair near the sides of her ears turning bright red.

<p id="line_3085">Momiji was not interested in hearing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s explanation, but the word “tunnel” had caught her attention.

<p id="line_3086">“This tunnel thing, it is something about opening a hole in the mountain so that the road can extend to the opposite side. We won’t press it if it’s not convenient for you—”</p>
<p id="line_3087">“Hold on. Opening a hole in the mountain? Are you serious?”</p>
<p id="line_3088">“Indeed. That’s how the plan states it. But we don’t need to dig any tunnel for the road being constructed this time.

<p id="line_3092">Even if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> tried to talk them out of it, the other party wouldn’t back down.

<p id="line_3093">“You mentioned a snake that stinks, were you perhaps referring to me?”</p>
<p id="line_3094">She was secretly boiling in fury as she stood up from her seat to stare at Momiji. A fight was about to break out as both persons began to emit a dangerous aura.</p>
<p id="line_3095">“Oi, stop that at once—”</p>
<p id="line_3096"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> tried to halt her when <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Alvis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s sharp gaze was shot at Momiji.</p>
<p id="line_3097">Extra Skill ‘Eyes of Heavenly Snake’—effects of paralysis, poison and madness etc. began to corrupt Momji who was in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Alvis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s direct line of sight.</p>
<p id="line_3098">Yet Momiji wasn’t concerned at all.</p>
<p id="line_3099">“Petty trickeries,” she chided. “I am the daughter of the tengu tribe elder; status ailment doesn’t work on me.” She closed her hands to draw out a fan.</p>
<p id="line_3100">The tengu were semi-spiritual lifeforms. Just as Momiji said, they had high resistance against status ailment. Moreover, Momiji’s Extra Skill ‘Sense of Heavenly Wolf’ was always activated. It offered analysis ability that surpassed the five senses and had effects similar to an advanced version of Extra Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ But that was not all, ‘Sense of Heavenly Wolf’ could also nullify all illusion and conjuring magic. That’s why such a sneak attack on Momiji would never work.</p>
<p id="line_3101">It’s almost as if she were saying “<em>It’s my turn”</em>, Momiji raised her fan and with smooth dancing motions, launched an attack at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Alvis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Alvis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> blocked the first hit with her golden khakkhara, yet was hit on the side of her stomach by the immediate follow-up, sending her flying to the corner of the hall.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3102">“Oooof.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3103">Although it was just a casual strike, Momiji’s movement was extremely skillful. She reopened the fan that closed due to the previous hit and elegantly used it to conceal her mouth.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3104">A moment passed before Momiji broke the silence.</p>

<p id="line_3110">“Holding back? That’s my line. I’ve put an effort trying not to kill our envoy. Or is it that you intend to truly anger me?”</p>
<p id="line_3111">The two stared at each other as the temperature in the surrounding room began to drop noticeably. Even the young tengu warriors standing guard in the hall fell victim as the whole room was filled with concentrated <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that tensed their nerves.

<p id="line_3112"><em>This could no longer be simply described as a misstep; things have gotten problematic.</em> He thought to himself while taking a sip.</p>

<p id="line_3114">“Wanna try? As you’ve said, I want to accumulate combat experience too. You happen to be a pretty good target to experiment with.”</p>
<p id="line_3115">The animosity was ever increasing between the two until it reached the breaking point.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3116">At that instant—</p>
<p id="line_3117">With the flash of a sword, the fan in Momiji’s hand was deflected.</p>
<p id="line_3118">Silence fell upon the hall.</p>
<p id="line_3119">The speed was so fast that no one was able to respond when <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> intervened in the duel.</p>

<p id="line_3128">The young tengu warriors quickly kneeled.</p>
<p id="line_3129">“M-Mother!”</p>
<p id="line_3130">As she cracked a smile towards the panicked Momiji, the tengu elder—Momiji’s mother—slowly stepped forward.</p>
<p id="line_3131">She then stepped towards Momiji—</p>
<p id="line_3132">“Silly girl!”</p>
<p id="line_3133">The elder scolded her loudly while approaching. Everyone changed the venue and the two parties sat face to face again. It was a Japanese-style room with tatami and futon (Japanese bedding). Deeper into this room was another U-shaped room without a door. It was specially arranged so that the tengu elder, who was often bedridden, could take a rest as soon as possible when she needed it.</p>
<p id="line_3134">After the incident, the elder gave Momiji a lesson with her fists, she was still holding her head with tears in her eyes. Although she still looked quite indignant, she didn’t appear to complain anymore.</p>
<p id="line_3135">“It’s all right, you don’t have to force yourself. We’ve only come here to greet you—”</p>
<p id="line_3136">Although their goal was not reached, the atmosphere at hand was no longer suitable for any negotiation. Moreover, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Alvis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was also dejected, so staying any longer would only make the situation more awkward. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> decided to leave when the elder herself came forth to abruptly halt him.</p>

Seeing his expression, the tengu elder smiled contently.</p>
<p id="line_3142">“My name is Kaede (Maple)—”</p>
<p id="line_3143">After saying this, the tengu elder Kaede began to tell the story of her past. According to her, around three hundred years ago, she seemed to have stayed in the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s village. She hid her true strength, went on journeys, and happened to encounter Byakuya and studied sword art under him. Kaede had a senior back then; the man could only be described as a genius who was born for the arts of the sword. He was also Byakuya’s grandson.</p>
<p id="line_3144">“How upsetting that I couldn’t grant him a name.”</p>
<p id="line_3145">Apparently, this was Byakuya’s mantra. Naming <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on a whim may end up costing you your life. Byakuya was human, so he would have definitely died. At the time, Kaede also didn’t have a ‘Name,’ so she couldn’t understand how he felt back then, unlike now. The hope he held was to leave something for his loved one. To <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it was normal to not have names, but it was different for humans.</p>
<p id="line_3146">Later, Byakuya’s life came to an end and passed away from this world leaving his grandson, who then became the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Swordsman (Kenki)<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Kenki is a title that this person got, it is directly translated to “Sword Devil.”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>. His strength quickly approached that of Kaede, and his technique was already far beyond hers. Moreover, Kaede was mesmerized by his dashing swordsmanship.</p>
<p id="line_3147">And so she confessed her love to him under a large maple tree.

<p id="line_3161">“W-wait a second, mother—?”</p>
<p id="line_3162">She helplessly tried to cover up Kaede’s mouth, but Momiji was no rival to Kaede.

<p id="line_3163"><em>How do you expect me to respond after asking so directly about such an important matter</em>—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was at a loss.</p>
<p id="line_3164">Hopefully, they would give him some time to consider. The other person who managed to save <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the girl of the hour, Momiji.</p>
<p id="line_3165">“Hold on! I know that mother has already acknowledged this guy. But I haven’t! He does indeed seem stronger than me… If that’s the case, I hope that he would not be forced by Mother, but rather to truly like me. A good woman should move the heart of the man she likes, didn’t mother always say that?”</p>
<p id="line_3166">Momiji flustered for some reason after saying this. She used her fan to hide her face before running away on her own. Kaede laughed out loud at the scene. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Alvis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> raised her head with some form of revelation while <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> felt a bit embarrassed seeing how Momiji had acted.</p>
<p id="line_3167"><em>Speaking of this, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has always acted very gracefully… Now that I’ve lost my cool over such an insignificant matter, it only means that my training is still lacking—</em></p>
<p id="line_3168">He did some self-reflection—but this whole incident just happened too abruptly… And so his marriage with Momiji was brought back to be discussed.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3169">Basically, the whole deal had been Kaede’s own personal wish, not actually something she wanted to impose on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. At most she was just delivering a message. It would be a huge gain for her if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had agreed, but that’s just a thought. The rest of the requests from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were also passed after brief discussion, there wasn’t much of a problem. The tunnel digging on the mountain was discussed separately, they permitted us to build the road to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3170">However, there were other issues to be discussed. Putting aside whether <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Momiji could get together, they hoped that the tengu tribe could build a good relationship with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—Kaede proposed as much.</p>
<p id="line_3171">Despite how she looked, Kaede was in fact extremely ill—or so they proclaimed to the public.</p>
<p id="line_3172">It was however not the case. Kaede was pregnant with Momiji for too long and passed most of her power to Momiji. After giving birth to her fifteen years ago<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="She met Hakurou around 300 years ago… That was a loooong pregnancy." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> and giving her a ‘Name.’ This caused her, the worshipped earth deity, to consume almost all of her magicule storage. Now she could only await her end.</p>
<p id="line_3173">That’s why Kaede hoped to find her cute yet inexperienced daughter a strong backing. That was her only wish.</p>
<p id="line_3174">And <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> happened to visit that land. To Kaede, it was a sign of hope. Kaede thought it was the last string of hope left by the man she loved.</p>
<p id="line_3175"><em>It won’t matter even if my wish is rejected. So <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had you by his side? I thought that you would have passed before me, what a delightful miscalculation. Surely it will draw back your memory when you see that child Momiji—</em>Kaede thought to herself, and so she agreed to discuss the issue in the future.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3176">And so, it was Momiji’s turn to visit <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_3177">About that… <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to be getting a serious headache over the whole thing. It was probably the biggest crisis <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had ever faced since he was born. He claimed it was even scarier than our initial encounter, which I was really not sure how to interpret. Perhaps it was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s way of joking.</p>
<p id="line_3178">Putting that aside however, even that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Alvis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was easily suppressed.

<p id="line_3179">—No, I’m running away from reality, that’s not the issue.

<p id="line_3180">A huge problem had emerged, and what truly unnerved me was that the conclusion I reached in resolving it was that we wouldn’t know how to deal with the matter unless we met them. After all, this issue couldn’t be resolved by me and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> alone. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would also play a key role in this, I’d have to hear him out.

<p class="space-break" id="line_3181">And soon after, last night—we found <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who had returned from the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to discuss among the three of us. Right now we had no clue what type of demands the tengu tribe would make. There was no telling what might happen, so we planned to receive them on the last day. That’s why I was about to summon <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> back if he didn’t manage to get back in time. But it seemed there was no such need.</p>
<p id="line_3182">With that being said however, he did manage to return in time, but the problem remained unresolved.

<p class="space-break" id="line_3183">“Please hold on! I have my own considerations as well, or perhaps should I stand my ground—”</p>
<p id="line_3184">“What are you talking about? Could it be that young master thinks my daughter is not worthy of you?”</p>
<p id="line_3185">“I never said that! By the way, you’ve never even seen her, didn’t even know she was born, so don’t act like a father now!”</p>

There was no way this meeting could continue…</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3188">We continued discussing without any rest, but there was still no conclusion. Afterwards we just decided on directly confronting the issue, which is how things had progressed up until today.</p>
<p id="line_3189">………</p>
<p id="line_3190">……</p>
<p id="line_3191">…</p>
<p id="line_3192">A table had been temporarily set up in the reception hall. A beautiful young girl was sitting across from me. The color of her hair transitioned from beautiful white to vibrant red. This young girl was the tengu tribe’s representative, the fabled Momiji.</p>
<p id="line_3193">She was looking at me arrogantly and greeted me in a bold tone.</p>
<p id="line_3194">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, nice to meet you. I have come in place of the chief of tengu tribe. My name is Momiji, I look forward to our future interaction.”</p>
<p id="line_3195">“You are too kind. I am <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who just became a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. What you see now is my human form, but I’m actually a slime. I’m practically a pacifist, so you can discuss with me if you ever run into any trouble.”</p>
<p id="line_3196">“You may spare the concern. It is truly impressive that you’ve united Jura Great Forest in this short time. I acknowledge that you are the ruler of this forest, so I hope you will be a good neighbor. However, do not interfere with us,” Momiji declared in front of the many executives of mine. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was about to react as her body shook a bit.

It seemed that there had been some change in her mind, causing her to no longer pursue every minor matter. That’s a good sign, but it was also a bit eerie. I hoped she wouldn’t endure too much and have an outbreak someday.</p>
<p id="line_3197">And about this Momiji, she was looking quite nervous while waiting for my response. It would not have been noticed if I hadn’t pointed it out. While she looked quite casual and relaxed, internally she was probably on the verge of being crushed by extreme unease. That’s probably because she couldn’t tell whether I was friend or foe.</p>
<p id="line_3198"><em>If that’s the case, all you guys need to do is show your willingness for allegiance. But how could such a thing be allowed by their prideful race? After all, an inexperienced leader is done for if she’s looked down on by others. I can understand her sentiment. But speaking of this, the young warriors of the tengu tribe do all seem to have given their fullest loyalty to Momiji.</em></p>
<p id="line_3199">“I see. I understand what you are getting at. We don’t intend to interfere too much. I believe <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> here has also explained, we just want to conduct some road construction work at the foot of Coscia mountain. There’s also another thing that I want to confirm with you, will you give the high orcs the permission to stay now that they’ve moved their settlement to the lower mountain region?”</p>
<p id="line_3200">“All right, all of these are fine. We’ve never claimed ownership to the resources of the mountain and forests, so they can do what they wish with the minerals. Those things are beyond our ownership. We simply dislike being interfered with, that is all.”</p>
<p id="line_3201">About that… The lower mountain region was part of the Jura Great Forest, so I expected that she would complain about it. While bracing myself for their answer, it seemed that they didn’t have a problem with it either.</p>
<p id="line_3202">If that’s the case, what could the tengu tribe really be on guard about? It seemed that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Alvis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also disliked them a lot, could it be some conflict with Beast King <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>? I was rather mindful of it, so I decided to cut to the chase.</p>
<p id="line_3203">“About that, I’m not sure what you guys are wary of, but we really don’t hope to be hostile against you.”</p>
<p id="line_3204">“Why should I believe you?”</p>
<p id="line_3205">“Hmm, even if you were to claim that we had ambitions to expand our territory, do you really have any evidence to warrant your suspicion?”</p>
<p id="line_3206">Momiji turned to me immediately upon hearing this, trying to determine whether we were friendly or hostile. Then she replied boldly: “Aren’t you guys on good terms with that sly bird lady Frey? Her desire to usurp our land is the best evidence!”</p>
<p id="line_3207">The so-called unforeseeable surprise<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The source here states: 寝耳に水, which means unforeseeable event" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> perfectly represented this type of situation.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3208">“Hold on, time out!”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3209">“Time out what now? What does that mean?”</p>
<p id="line_3210">“It means stop! We need to discuss some things!”</p>
<p id="line_3211">I gathered all the executives and began to discuss. Momiji agreed without hesitation, but it seemed to have been mixed with some complaints… I must have heard wrong. While leaving aside Momiji who was muttering something, we gathered in a circle.</p>
<p id="line_3212">“Right, what do you guys think?”</p>
<p id="line_3213">“Ex-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Frey’s territory is connected with the Coscia mountain, so it wouldn’t be unheard of if she has caused conflict with the tengu tribe,” to my question, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> quickly replied.</p>
<p id="line_3214">Indeed, I checked the map in my mind as I thought so. The tengu’s residence was not within the Jura Great Forest and therefore not within any <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s agreement of protection. They were very easily invaded by others.</p>
<p id="line_3215">“But what could have been the reason?”</p>
<p id="line_3216">“Indeed, there’s no reason to invade,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> followed up. He had gone to the actual location and knew that there weren’t any resources there.</p>
<p id="line_3217">“I’ve heard something before. It is rumored that Frey likes to go to move around locations with high altitude. Perhaps it is just as her nickname ‘Sky Queen’ suggests, could she be trying to move her city to the highest location?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> pondered while raising the case, but it still sounded a bit weird. Since according to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, only by going through the cave at the mountain top would you reach the arcadia that was the hidden residence of the tengu tribe—in other words, it was actually in a tiny alternate dimension. I figured that would be quite different from the city that Frey would hope for.</p>
<p id="line_3218">“Hmmm—”</p>
<p id="line_3219">Everyone fell silent while contemplating. And then—</p>
<p id="line_3220">“You people—Stop treating me like air!”</p>
<p id="line_3221">“Uhh!”</p>
<p id="line_3222">I got spooked when someone suddenly shouted next to me. Momiji had come over to vent her rising frustration. Now I couldn’t pretend that I’d not heard her. So I decided to give up struggling and returned to my seat. I opened up directly facing Momiji, “I have a question to ask. Has Frey ever schemed against the tengu domain for the purpose of expanding?”</p>
<p id="line_3223">“Ah? What nonsense is that—”</p>
<p id="line_3224">Momiji looked at me dumbfounded. But after realizing that I was serious, she muttered: “You gotta be joking…” I saw that we seemed to be developing a grave misunderstanding, so to alleviate that, I asked her to give a detailed explanation of her own situation. Here’s what Momiji had to say:</p>
<p id="line_3225">The place Frey had her eyes on was the capital of Sorcerer’s Dynasty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, “City embraced by the divine tree, Elmin <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.” She was not pursuing territory, but height. <em>Can’t believe that’s actually her goal</em>. It was quite like Frey’s style, and she wasn’t joking around.</p>
<p id="line_3226">Judging by scale alone, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was undoubtedly a powerful nation with military power exceeding that of Frey. However, though the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> army could utilize its geographic advantage to look down on land armies from above, they couldn’t avoid the harsh battle against the great army of Frey who could fly freely in the sky. In other words, Frey had not given up on the divine tree. It was then that Frey took interest in the tengu tribe. She wanted to recruit the powerful tengu race to bolster her arsenal against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3227">However, the tengu were a prideful race. They wouldn’t listen to Frey’s command that easily. On the other hand, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had also predicted how the tengu would act. They simply observed the other two factions battling each other until they depleted their strength. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t intend to collaborate in fighting their enemy but sat and enjoyed the profit of their conflict. Of course, Frey also realized this and didn’t make a move without caution. And so, a twisted triangle relationship was thus formed…</p>
<p id="line_3228">It was then that the war between me and Clayman broke out, and soon enough <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Frey became <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Milim’s subjects. A powerful force was thus born. One that the tengu tribe was unable to defend against. Every day since then they had been discussing where to migrate to in the future.</p>
<p id="line_3229"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others happened to visit at the time. The unlucky part was that the Beastketeer <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Alvis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was with them. It has caused Momiji to have misunderstood that we were quietly pressuring them.</p>
<p id="line_3230">“What’s the situation on Frey-san’s side?” I asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He was in charge of the construction of their new capital, so Frey probably had made many requests from him. Among my allies, he was the man most familiar with Frey.</p>
<p id="line_3231">“Yes Sir, about this Frey-sama, she’s very satisfied with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s design. She’s even able to communicate smoothly with Mildo-san who doesn’t like to talk, even holding detailed discussions in the past.”</p>
<p id="line_3232"><em>Oh, so she can even communicate with Mildo. I’m rather impressed by Frey.</em></p>
<p id="line_3233">“I see. Then she probably won’t be interested in the divine tree.”</p>
<p id="line_3234">“Indeed… Actually, speaking of that, Frey-sama’s interest has turned to—I’ve spoken too much—”</p>
<p id="line_3235">“Hmm? What happened to Frey’s interest?”</p>
<p id="line_3236">“Yes Sir, actually… We’ve not seen Milim-sama for a while. Frey-sama who was responsible for educating her didn’t pay attention for a second and she ran off to god knows where—”</p>
<p id="line_3237">Ah, right. I know where she is. But, I’m gonna pretend I know nothing of it. The saying goes “Don’t go look for trouble yourself,” I didn’t want to get dragged in that mess.</p>
<p id="line_3238">“—So that’s how it is, Frey-sama’s new hobby…or rather, focus, I think has been her search for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Milim-sama,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> concluded his explanation.</p>
<p id="line_3239">The skyscrapers of the new capital—that gigantic building that reaches for the sky had completely mesmerized Frey. Surely at this point, comparing it to any other city would just be stupid, so she must have lost interest in them as well. Compared to that, Milim was the bigger problem.</p>
<p id="line_3240">After which, Momiji absorbed the entirety of our conversation. The dichotomy between her imagination and the reality was so large to have caused her to become speechless, not knowing how to react. I guess that should be the case. That’s just how the reality really is. They were just keeping up their guard against a certain enemy that might cause crisis to their race, but it turned out she had switched her focus long ago. Learning this today would definitely prompt people to try and escape reality.</p>
<p id="line_3241">“—I understand the whole thing now. Anyway, that’s how it is. It is enough for me to have been able to resolve your misunderstanding.”</p>
<p id="line_3242">It was likely because the tengu had kept away from the world and were less informed on current affairs. They were still worried about being surrounded by enemies. Such anxiety caused Momiji to misjudge. Indeed, she had her reasons to make such judgement under those circumstances.</p>
<p id="line_3243">“I can’t believe that it was me who thought too much… Mother has always said that I was worrying too much about the matter…”</p>
<p id="line_3244">After finishing her words, Momiji felt relieved. She collapsed on the spot having been so exhausted. Seeing how she reacted, we gained a very profound insight into how terrifying it was to cause too much misunderstanding.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_3245">Since the misunderstanding had been resolved, the meeting quickly concluded. In place of the frustrated Momiji, a young warrior of the tengu tribe confirmed the content of our pact. I thought that he was just Momiji’s guard, but it seemed that he was also a capable civil official.</p>
<p id="line_3246">The tunnel part was reserved for now. Their argument was that if we couldn’t prove that the construction would be absolutely safe, they wouldn’t allow us to work. I found it reasonable and easily agreed, so there weren’t any problems with that. We still needed to talk with the executives from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> regarding us building a tunnel, but we would plan for that after the train development had concluded. There was no immediate need to make a decision at this point in time. The tengu tribe hoped that we would not interfere with them, but they only said so fearing that we might rally and invade them.</p>
<p id="line_3247">Now that our misunderstanding had been resolved, there was no reason why we shouldn’t communicate. And so we reached common ground, at last where we would help each other out no matter what problem we ran into.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3248">“—Then, is that everything?”</p>
<p id="line_3249">“Yes. We are extremely grateful for your understanding and participation in this helpful meeting with us. Thank you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama,” the young warrior of the tengu tribe bowed to me courteously. Momiji was no longer misunderstanding us and we had also signed a pact. The only thing left was—</p>
<p id="line_3250">The relationship between <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Momiji as well as the marriage between <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and her.</p>
<p id="line_3251">We had discussed a ton last night to no avail. From what happened today, Momiji seemed to have suspected we were enemies throughout the session, but those misunderstandings had now been resolved. Now then, shouldn’t we let the people involved sort things out by themselves?</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3252">Just as I was worried about how to approach the subject, the young tengu warrior took out a sealed envelope.</p>
<p id="line_3253">“There’s one more thing. Please have a look at this. It contains a letter written by our leader Kaede-sama to your Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,” as he finished, he handed over the letter to me gently. Rigurd took the letter and handed it to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> for her to open. She began to read the content of the letter out loud.</p>
<p id="line_3254">The letter opened with some abstruse words of greeting followed by some humble writing that seemed to be trying to get on the recipient’s good side. But then the word choices became more and more casual. As <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> read it, a sense of confusion arose on her face too.</p>
<p id="line_3255">“<em>—Even though she’s a headache to deal with and misunderstood you, I’ll entrust my daughter to you. That child even bragged about letting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono fall in love with her before, she really doesn’t mean any harm—</em>”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3256"><em>Eh, are you sure this is a letter for me? No no, no no no, it doesn’t seem to be no matter how you see it. Had I known that this is the content of the letter from the start, I would have the honor guard leave the scene… But it’s all too late at this point.</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3257">“M-Mother, what is this—?”</p>
<p id="line_3258">Momiji who was on the ground suddenly jumped up to take the letter from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s hand. <em>Eh, that’s so rude. But I can’t really blame her—</em></p>
<p id="line_3259">Since I couldn’t blame her, I’d just pretend I saw nothing. If I switched places with Momiji right now, god knows what type of thing I would have done. This had long since passed a matter concerning reputation and was challenging the limits of shame.</p>
<p id="line_3260">“S-So there are actually two letters! That’s so rash, mother dear…” Momiji cried out loud and collapsed on the ground, burying her face in her hands.</p>
<p id="line_3261"><em>Ah, I see… It seems that the letter for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was mixed with the letter for me. Missy, please stay strong.</em></p>
<p id="line_3262">While the tengu tribesmen were coming and trying to comfort Momiji, it had little more than the opposite effect. It was best to stay away from her for now. But it was at that instant—</p>
<p id="line_3263">“Hehe, that does seem like something she would do.”</p>
<p id="line_3264"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> walked towards Momiji with a wry smile. He then took over the letter held tightly in her hand and scanned through it.</p>
<p id="line_3265">“I see how it is now. ‘<em>—Although that child possesses powerful strength, her techniques are below expectations. I hope that my senior and the father of that child—“Kenki” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono will instruct her by hand and train her well—To my beloved husband, Kaede—</em>’ I can’t believe that girl is still in love with me. Hehehe, living a bit longer does have its plus side.”</p>
<p id="line_3266">Upon saying so, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began to laugh joyfully.</p>
<p id="line_3267">“A-are you… My father?”</p>
<p id="line_3268">“Indeed. I am your father, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_3269">“D-Dad!”</p>
<p id="line_3270">Tears began to drop from her black eyes that shared a striking resemblance to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s.

<p id="line_3274">“Yes!!”</p>
<p id="line_3275">Hmm, ehehhh!</p>
<p id="line_3276">I nodded quite frequently with a moved heart when hearing their conversation, but without my notice, the conversation started to stray into some strange direction.</p>

<p id="line_3337">“—Moreover, it is actually surprisingly easy to get the affection of women.”</p>
<p id="line_3338">“W-what do you mean!”</p>
<p id="line_3339">How is that possible—I asked based on this thought, and as a result <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> responded with something extremely unexpected with a cold face.</p>
<p id="line_3340">“There was a female knight who seemed to have had some sort of misunderstanding and developed strong feelings for me,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> commented almost like a complaint with disdain in his tone.</p>

<p id="line_3349">Using ‘Sticky Steel String’ a bit for what—as I thought so, a sudden surge of killing aura appeared behind me followed by a loud cough.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3350">“Ahem!”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3351">We were whispering just now when we suddenly froze to switch back to a serious expression. As I shouted internally “Oh snap” I turned back to slime form in secret to flee, but was hugged by a pair of white and slim hands.</p>

<p id="line_3360">Not just harem, we didn’t even support polygamy. Unless the situation forced that to happen, for instance if there were too many widows, otherwise our nation did not apply such a system.</p>
<p id="line_3361">Just as I thought the whole thing was over, even more trouble emerged.</p>

<p id="line_3366">“That’s fine, I guess? You shouldn’t just duel each other, rather put in effort to let the person you like fall in love with yourself. But, if he still doesn’t like you, you may just have to give up.”</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_3373">By the way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Alvis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had always been in a state of observing, it was from today onward that she began to take action and tried to win <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s heart desperately.

It became obvious to see that the battle for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> among the female army had become more and more dire.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3374">—From this day onward, there began a bizarre custom in Tempest Federation that was to force the person you had a crush on into submission through a display of strength.</p>

<h1 class="ch-number">Epilogue</h1>
<h1 class="ch-name">Concluding Meeting</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_3377">It was near evening on the last day of the reception ceremony that we concluded our meeting with the tengu tribe. All the executives had gathered in the meeting room after a somewhat early dinner—I was looking forward to that part—and I wanted everyone to give a report on their recent activities on this rare occasion. I also invited certain guests to this meeting as well. There were Veldora and Ramiris, accompanied by her servants Beretta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. Milim would be officially visiting in three days. Fearing the reveal of her recent activities, she quickly returned. It was a smart move considering there was no telling whether Frey would scold Milim or not, but keeping Milim in this town would definitely anger her. I didn’t really want to get involved in that whole mess.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3378">Right, there’s, however, one more guest—</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3379">“I want to introduce someone before the meeting starts. He is a candidate for an executive position, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. If the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in three days goes without a hitch, I plan to officially appoint him as the Minister of Finance (Head of Financial Management Department). I hope everyone can get acquainted with him beforehand,” I declared, since everyone was here, might as well take the chance to introduce him. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could also summarize the whole ordeal regarding the festival and gave his explanation…</p>
<p id="line_3380">“I-I am Gard <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I am quite nervous right now given the important duty assigned to me by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. Nonetheless, I hope to have a good relationship with all executives in the future.”</p>
<p id="line_3381"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was quite obese, so he didn’t look tense at all and it was bold of him to have greeted them so daringly. That being said, he did look more nervous than usual. Despite being a boss in the underworld, he couldn’t use that status nearly as effectively when dealing with actual <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. After introducing him to everyone, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was seated next to Rigurd, and we cut straight to the chase.</p>
<p id="line_3382">“Then, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, could I trouble you to explain the situation to everyone?”</p>
<p id="line_3383">“Roger that. I’ll do my best with my limited ability—”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3384">Upon my instruction, he stood up to explain how the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be run. Two days from now, on the evening before the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the town would celebrate the eve of the festival. The guests would consist not only of those invited to the main festival, but also the visiting merchants and adventurers responsible for protecting them. We planned to offer free meals and wine to these visitors.</p>
<p id="line_3385">Of course, this event would be announced to the public, so we could expect some peasants from the neighboring countries to be coming as well. Since they might very well be our future customers, we would have to welcome them with open arms.</p>
<p id="line_3386">As for the guest hotel, we would be hosting a night feast there for any royalty and nobles. Regarding the dishes that would be served to said elite, they would be made between <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Yoshida-san. Since most of the food prepared by them would likely be new cuisine, I was also looking forward to it. Further, we had changed the feast serving style to that of a buffet so everyone could try a wider variety of cuisines without needing to eat too much.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3387">Now regarding the main event, i.e. the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3388">I would be giving a speech on stage in the morning. I had thought through this over and over, and I came to the conclusion that we couldn’t skip this part considering that I was going to announce to the public that I had become a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And since all my executives and guests here were aware of the situation, my proposal was approved.</p>
<p id="line_3389">Next, we would be hosting a martial tournament at the colosseum. But we didn’t plan to just let them stand there and enjoy the one competition. After all, it was our priority to let the other nations and towns get to know our country as more than just violent, so we couldn’t have them stick <s>to the web novel and have the readers read a boring ass tournament arc from start to finish</s> around to only watch the tournament from start to finish.</p>
<p id="line_3390">That’s why we also planned to perform music pieces at the recently built, classy opera house for them to enjoy. As for what type of program would be shown there; I have no clue. While I was somewhat worried about it, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was very confident.</p>
<p id="line_3391">“—I will use the opportunity to show everyone that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama is also a man of culture.”</p>
<p id="line_3392">A cunning grin emerged on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s face while saying that. Almost as if she were playing along with his scheme, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to be grinning as well. Could it be that…?</p>
<p id="line_3393">There’s no use worrying about it. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had already given me the guarantee, so I’d just take his word for it. After everyone finished lunch, we would be holding a technological presentation at the museum. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Vesta would be explaining the history of the healing potion to everyone; <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Garm would be showcasing various pieces of gear.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3394">By the way, the opera house and museum would only be open for civilian use on the second day of the festival. On the first day, we would only be allowing royalty or nobility in. After all, there would be security concerns, so it was most effective to separate the two groups of visitors.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3395">And then for the second day:</p>
<p id="line_3396">We would be watching the main contestants (after the elimination round) of the tournament. Then, in the afternoon we planned to be hosting a delightful festival of cultural exchange—an activity in name only, which was basically just to serve as an excuse for free roaming.</p>
<p id="line_3397">I would be staying at the VIP section of the colosseum, ready to discuss any matters brought forth by whomever wanted to meet me. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be in charge of moderating this part, so all I needed to do was relax and enjoy the tournament. We would be assigning guides to guests based on the number of invitations, so we hoped everyone would be able to shop and have fun during the festival, visit and savor our exceptional hot spring street or finish viewing the tournament. It would be wonderful if everyone had an excellent experience.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3398">And on the third day, we would be displaying the highly anticipated labyrinth available to the public. In the morning they could watch the finale of the tournament, and in the afternoon, they could watch an adventurer’s walkthrough of the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_3399">“Even without me, you guys were still able to build an absolutely majestic colosseum,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> remarked, relieved. He was quite reassured to find that there were suitable successors for him.</p>
<p id="line_3400">“Indeed. You and Mildo’s apprentice <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobkyu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> worked hard to build it. It doesn’t look rushed at all, and its durability also appears to be quite decent. Although, while it might be a different case if the executives dueled each other, it is more than enough for individuals below Rank A to battle.”</p>
<p id="line_3401">In terms of safety, the colosseum was at the level where it should be able to stand up against Greater Spirits such as the Flame Giant Ifirit. But it probably wouldn’t be able to hold if hit in some particularly weak spots. Not to worry though, I would be present on the day of the main event and planned to apply a thin barrier of ‘Absolute Defense’ just in case. That’s why, as long as nothing too major happened, the audience should all be safe and sound.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_3403">Ah, so he hadn’t forgotten about it. Given that his spirit to open a store was so high, we could only have him participate with his identity hidden. Speaking of which, for some reason <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had become remarkably acquainted with Veldora. He had been receiving many difficult tasks, aka. favors, from Veldora, but now he seemed to have gotten used to dealing with that dragon. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was really something else. It truly impressed me as this guy was far stronger than I previously imagined.</p>
<p id="line_3404">All right, that concluded the explanations.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3405">Personnel who were previously on an expedition such as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> appeared to be intrigued by the proceedings. Their unfortunate absence seemed to frustrate them a bit. I felt that I should give these three a bonus reward for their efforts. I’d give something to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> when he finished his work, and as for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they’d already drafted the perfect battle plan.</p>
<p id="line_3406">With this in mind, I glanced around at my executives thoughtfully.</p>
<p id="line_3407">“Our plan is going smoothly; does anyone have any complaints?”</p>
<p id="line_3408">If not, we could move on to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s report—</p>
<p id="line_3409">“Yes!”</p>
<p id="line_3410">—But I reached that conclusion too fast apparently. Ramiris raised her hand, rather vigorously too. She appeared to have a question, but it was probably nothing significant.</p>
<p id="line_3411">“What is it, Ramiris-kun?”</p>
<p id="line_3412">“Ehh, I’ve got a question.”</p>
<p id="line_3413">“That’s what I just asked.”</p>
<p id="line_3414">“It’s about the bottom level of the labyrinth…”</p>
<p id="line_3415">Ramiris paused to take a peek at Veldora. It was followed by Veldora’s loud laughter in an attempt to hide something.</p>
<p id="line_3416">“GAHAHAHA! No, there’s nothing there. Nothing important at all! Isn’t there a forest at level 95? For some reason, the forest has been growing and has now invaded all the way up to level 71,” Veldora chortled, “Miscalculation, miscalculation!”</p>
<p id="line_3417">Floors 91 to 94 were already isolated from the outside, so it was not affected by the forest’s take over, but the unprotected levels now looked like primal forests as the ventilation system for filtering magicules had been affected.</p>
<p id="line_3418">“Hold up hold up, now we have to clean all that up! That’ll take ages!”</p>
<p id="line_3419">“Right. That’s why I’ve come to discuss this with you!”</p>
<p id="line_3420">Ramiris had decided to just be frank about it. Even though the issue was quite baffling, this was entirely due to Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_3421">Despite already being the person at fault, Veldora dug his grave deeper with: “Not only that, there is another problem.” While I didn’t really want to ask, what has to be done has to be done.</p>
<p id="line_3422">With such a mindset, I queried, “…What is it?” yet Veldora’s answer was rather surprising.</p>
<p id="line_3423">“We didn’t find any suitable <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to be level bosses. Which is a problem I need to discuss with you.”</p>
<p id="line_3424">Fortunately, he wasn’t asking about anything dumber.</p>
<p id="line_3425">Apparently, the forest consumed the labyrinth’s magicules too quickly for any stronger <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to be created. Which is probably why there hadn’t been a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> born strong enough to be a boss of the bottom levels.</p>
<p id="line_3426">There <em>was</em> a Rank A <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—a tempest serpent that was now the lord of level 40. Initially, it was Veldora and Ramiris who argued that we shouldn’t use trash like that for the position, but nowadays they wanted me to give it back to them, something I didn’t plan to do.</p>
<p id="line_3427">“I want to rebuild the Elemental Colossus. That’s why I’m hoping you can help prepare some materials for me.”</p>
<p id="line_3428">“Just find a suitable lord candidate for me. Also, remember to clean the primal forest first.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3429">“…”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3430">I understood what Ramiris meant. We only planned to make the first 50 levels public this time, so we could think of ideas for that another time. As for Veldora’s proposal, I didn’t have to listen to him. Since there was still time, I’d tell him to figure out a way himself. But just as I was about to refuse—three voices were raised all at the same time:</p>
<p id="line_3431">“If that’s the case, there are some pretty suitable candidates.”</p>
<p id="line_3432">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, how about we hand the work to those people?”</p>
<p id="line_3433">“My master, there are indeed some pretty good candidates—”</p>
<p id="line_3434">They were <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san and Ranga.</p>
<p id="line_3435"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said that wight, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, was suitable for the role. Hearing her comment, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_3436">“His subordinates are all afraid of light, so they like to stay in caves or places away from the sun. The inside of the labyrinth should be a pretty good place for them.”</p>
<p id="line_3437">Aside from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, his subordinates couldn’t leave the sealed cave at all. It was said that they came out to stroll at night, and whenever a merchant ran into them, they usually all came to complain. That’s only natural; running into skeletons at night is guaranteed to make you piss yourself. Isolating them entirely in the labyrinth seemed like a good idea actually.</p>
<p id="line_3438">“Besides, that guy practically treats <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama as God, which is pretty intolerable…” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> tacked on, rather annoyed.</p>
<p id="line_3439">They seemed to worship me as their god and considering <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a miko-hime (shrine maiden), that probably <em>was</em> quite annoying. In that case, I decided to accept the proposal.</p>
<p id="line_3440">“Then let’s have <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as the boss of level 60. I’ll start preparing the materials so Ramiris can go create an Elemental Colossus and I’ll tell <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to help as well.”</p>
<p id="line_3441">“Is that okay?”</p>
<p id="line_3442">“Should be fine. That guy’s specialty is knowledge. I think he can even help with researching.”</p>
<p id="line_3443">“I understand.

<p id="line_3444">And so, the search for a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> lord in levels 60 and 70 had been resolved. Next, it was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s turn to speak.</p>
<p id="line_3445">Since levels 71 to 80 had less vegetation, she asked for Zegion and Apito to guard the location.</p>
<p id="line_3446">“These two executives are able to summon their vassals (clansman), so exploration will be easier. Moreover—“ she glanced at Ramiris and then turned to me.</p>
<p id="line_3447">“If we can get him, Zegion, he should be able to fill the role as the boss of level 80. After all, he did a great job protecting the treants before,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san said, smiling.</p>
<p id="line_3448">“I see…”</p>
<p id="line_3449">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, that sounds perfect! Let me train that guy to become a warrior worthy of the title as the boss of level 80!”</p>
<p id="line_3450">Zegion indeed seemed stronger than I imagined. When I last checked on him, he had already grown stronger than the tempest serpent of level 40. But he was still just an insect, barely the size of a small animal!</p>
<p id="line_3451"><em>It would probably be pretty hard to train him… Never mind, all is well. I already know that Veldora is a weirdo anyway, so if he really wants to, sure.</em></p>
<p id="line_3452">“Right. Then, we can just do it your way.”</p>
<p id="line_3453">With my permission given, the problem was basically resolved instantly.</p>
<p id="line_3454">At last, we came to Ranga’s suggestion. The big boy stuck his head out from my shadow to talk, “Master, the Youko (<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Fox) that you left with me has awakened. It says that it really enjoys exploring the forest. I think it would be quite interested in managing it entirely.”</p>
<p id="line_3455">A small cute fox sat on his head waving four golden tails behind it. That really was an adorable creature!</p>
<p id="line_3456">“Do you want to give it a try?”</p>
<p id="line_3457">“I would like to!”</p>
<p id="line_3458">The small fox nodded at me, eyes shining. Hmm, how cute indeed.</p>
<p id="line_3459">Since this small fox willingly accepted the job, I’d just hand it over to it. If it didn’t meet our expectations, we would just have to get rid of the forest. Otherwise it could simply explore the forest for us and form animal passages within the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_3460">“All right, then—”</p>
<p id="line_3461">I suddenly realized that there was a problem, when it was under Clayman’s rule, this small fox—Youko—previously known as the “Nine-Headed Beast” didn’t actually have a name.</p>
<p id="line_3462">“Before that, let me give you a name. From today onward, you will be known as ‘Kumara.”’</p>
<p id="line_3463">Just like naming a pet, I thoughtlessly just gave it a name. But I am no idiot; I’d learnt the lesson about not losing massive amounts of magicule over naming. That’s why I had already set a limit—eh, how strange?</p>
<p id="line_3464">My body suddenly felt exhausted. I couldn’t help but get unnerved.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3465">«Notice. This is the effect of naming. Individual named “Kumara” has a massive pool of natural magicule storage. Thus, the magicule consumption of said action has “Exceeded Expectation.”»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3466">I had been deceived by its miniature appearance. I now recalled it to be some super rare incredible <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It seems I got careless. Moreover, after being named, Kumara grew almost instantaneously, and the number of its tails increased from four all the way up to nine. In its battle against Ranga, it had three tails. And all these tails were able to summon magic beasts<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The term here is again “magic beast” as opposed to “monster”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> with special abilities. In other words, now it would probably be able to summon nine different beasts.</p>
<p id="line_3467">“Thank you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama! I will do my best!”</p>
<p id="line_3468">Never mind, it’s fine. Since I had already named it, I couldn’t just undo it.</p>
<p id="line_3469">Either way, personally, I was safe and sound, so it seemed everything was within the control of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei. The way it announced “Exceeded Expectation” didn’t sound shocked at all. It probably planned to transfer so many magicules from the beginning. Or else how could the newly named Kumara have grown another five tails?</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3470">«…»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3471"><em>There’s no use playing dumb. I’ve seen through it all!</em></p>
<p id="line_3472">Kumara was absolutely delighted, so I’d hand levels 81 to 90 to it. After all, there shouldn’t be many adventurers who would make it there, so it’d be fine to have Kumara as a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> lord. With that, the problems raised by Ramiris and Veldora had been resolved.</p>
<p id="line_3473">This labyrinth was our proud masterpiece, and the executives also seemed to be looking forward to it, so we had to ensure the whole program remained on the right track.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3474">With that thought, I pet Kumara on the head.</p>

<p id="line_3483">Oh yeah, that aside, I needed to talk about this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. There was too little information so far to judge his personality and strength. But if his triumph over the “Slave Trade Union” and releasing elven slaves turned out to be true…</p>
<p id="line_3484">“It seems that several elves were captured by the trade union. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> apparently is bringing them to our kingdom.”</p>
<p id="line_3485">If that were the case, I’d better give him my thanks. However, the problem was…</p>
<p id="line_3486">“How about it, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama? Before things get dicey, should I go and take care of him?”</p>
<p id="line_3487">“—No, don’t do that. I want to meet him. Maybe have a chat with him.”</p>
<p id="line_3488">“Understood. That guy seems to be marching under the banner of ‘Eliminating the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ I was planning to show him who’s the boss and let him know his place.”</p>
<p id="line_3489">—Right, just as his words indicated, the Western Nations were all spreading the rumor that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was coming to eliminate me.</p>

Speaking of which, as we were preparing the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and dealing with such important national affairs, it would be very bad if we provoked the Chosen <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Not only <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>; but I was afraid that the two warmongers <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would act preemptively.</p>

<p id="line_3494">The joyful atmosphere we worked so hard to build seemed to have been completely wiped out by the others. I felt a little frustrated.</p>

<h1 class="afterword" id="afterword">Afterword</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_3497">Sorry to keep everyone waiting, here I bring you volume eight.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3498">For those who have read the Web Novel before, you will know this volume is the “Founding of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> City” arc. As for why the sudden title change of this volume, there is quite the story behind it—</p>
<p id="line_3499">“Ahh, I will definitely finish up suuuuper fast this time and make the story short!”</p>
<p id="line_3500">“I’ve heard that line far too many times already. I won’t mind at this point no matter how long you want to write.”</p>
<p id="line_3501">With such words echoing by my ear, I grabbed my pen to write.</p>
<p id="line_3502">And as I wrote and wrote, the deadline arrived…</p>
<p id="line_3503">“Hey, there’s something I wish to discuss…”</p>
<p id="line_3504">“Right right right, what do you want to discuss?”</p>
<p id="line_3505">“About that, I’ve written things a bit too long this time…”</p>
<p id="line_3506">“Oh shit, here we go again. I knew this was how things would have gone,” Editor I-san replied rather unfazed by it.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3507">But there’s another twist coming!</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3508">“Can I make it into two parts?”</p>
<p id="line_3509">“Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_3510">“Even if I continue to write for another hundred pages or so, all I will end up doing is getting stuck at an awkward spot in the story. That’s why we should change our direction to instead make it into two parts this time, won’t that be great?”</p>
<p id="line_3511">“It better be! Seriously though, how did things end up like this!”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3512">We continued to have a very <em>lovely</em> conversation. In the end I was successful in making editor I-san roll his eyes (and agree). Nicu job!</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 8/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_3513">So yeah. I’ve been reflecting as well.</p>
<p id="line_3514">I’ve got no clue why things ended up like this myself, but I’m beginning to realize: isn’t it a bit too challenging for me to try shortening the story?</p>
<p id="line_3515">And so, I am currently focusing on finishing up the rest of the arc in volume nine “Founding of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom.” I will try my best not to turn it into a trilogy.</p>
<p id="line_3516">I look forward to your feedback in the future as well.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3517">See you in the next volume then!</p>
