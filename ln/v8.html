Even with relevant knowledge, it was still an impossible feat to recreate dishes in such a short period of time.

By using my skill to perform ‘Spatial Transportation’, I was able to create a means to transport and maintain freshness, therefore allowing us to accommodate different types of ingredients.

But everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_478"><span class="indent"><span>Based on all these reasons, we toiled to develop all sorts of cuisines.

Compared to the Japanese rice that had been researched and improved since time immemorial, the quality of ours was definitely inferior.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_480"><span class="indent"><span>But that was only natural. I didn’t expect things to go that smoothly anyways. We were able to quickly harvest by using magic to grow them. But with that being said, growing them in the winter season was no easy feat. Currently we only had a small amount growing in controlled indoor environments. It would take a long time before we could show any results.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_481"><span class="indent"><span>But there may be a solution.

Although at this point, it was probably already too late to be saying stuff like this. We’d used this method quite recklessly during the production of wines, so any intention of self-restraint was long gone.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_484"><span class="indent"><span>Our appetite took precedence over ethics. But we couldn’t rely on </span><span data-term="Shion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s power during every harvest, so we needed to continue our research.

In order to ensure good relations from now on, we had to demonstrate our country’s value. We had both a carrot and a stick to offer. Your impression of someone will skyrocket if you get treated well despite having a negative impression in the past. If a delinquent youth were to suddenly commit a virtuous deed, his or her reputation would be greatly improved—that was my thought process at least.

The current plan was to have the human society accept us. Given that all the leaders of the world had come to know us, this plan was halfway to success. There were even reports of suspected spies being sighted in our nation. We thus showcased our harmless side to them without even noticing. The news should also have been spreading among merchants and adventurers so that the civilians of different kingdoms would learn about the prospect of our coexistence. However, it would probably take some time before such an idea firmly took root. But we’d get there one day, so there’s no need to rush.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_968"><span class="indent"><span>Next in line was the preparation of roads.

I wished to place my hope in the children and build up schools for their education. Right now, we were only at private school (Terakoya)</span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Not exactly private school in the western sense. The term here is “寺子屋” which is referring to private institute in the ancient Japan Edo Period for educating commoners.

But I aspired to use my network formed during my time as a teacher to hire some human tutors.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_971"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_972"><span class="indent"><span>But going back to the original topic, let’s talk about communication. Right now, the available communication network was mostly formed by communicative crystal balls that only mages could operate. Moreover, they stood the risk of being stolen, given that they were magic items after all. In fact, there were several cases of theft involving them. More importantly, we had to assume that there may be no available mage when an emergency call needed to be made. We had to find a medium that didn’t run the risk of being stolen and was also accessible to anyone. These were quite demanding terms, yet there turned out to be a solution.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_973"><span class="indent"><span>I had my eyes on ‘Sticky Steel Web’ and magisteel. I already tried it with </span><span data-term="Souei" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. The conductivity of telepathic thoughts through my ‘Sticky Steel Web’ was extremely high. There were also magicules within it, lending the clarity of communication a very high quality. There was also magisteel, which possesses large amounts of magicule as well. That’s why I suspected it had similar properties to ‘Sticky Steel Web’. It turned out to be exactly the case after I ran an experiment. That’s why I decided to use them effectively.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_974"><span class="indent"><span>I would process magisteel into cables with a diameter of around one centimeter and connect them to all the major cities using ‘</span><span data-term="Shadow Step" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’. That alone wouldn’t do the trick, but in conjunction with the device that Vesta and the rest developed, it was going to convert one’s thoughts into voice and image. The device could be run even without mana, which was why the devices could be installed as soon as they were developed. Therefore, all we could do was to start preparing the necessary magisteel.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_975"><span class="indent"><span>Due to our nation having a huge population of </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, the iron ores stored in our warehouses would become magic ores overtime.

Since there weren’t any obstacles, setting them up would likely be effortless. Depending on how much we could make, we would not be connecting wires exclusively to major cities, but also the villages along the main lines of the network as well. We had that part planned out too.

It looked like they were planning to build a balcony next. Why build a shack? Apparently, it was for creating the new entrance to the labyrinth…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2087"><span class="indent"><span>Speaking of this, Ramiris had mentioned something about wanting to move to this town. If all they were doing was setting up an entrance to Ramiris’s labyrinth, putting such a small shack here didn’t seem to pose a problem.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2088"><span class="indent"><span>“So, you were trying to build the shack when the gatekeeper stopped you. And after you he interfered, you ordered </span><span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san to put him to sleep.

This was my domain after all, even the other </span><span data-term="demon" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> lords had recognized it. What Ramiris was doing undoubtedly infringed on my territory. Normally, it wouldn’t be strange if an incident like this developed into open war.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2093"><span class="indent"><span>But right now I had an idea. Seeing the small shack in front of me, I had a sudden burst of inspiration.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2094"><span class="indent"><span>After doing a bit of outside the box thinking, it wouldn’t be so bad to let her create the labyrinth here. My conversation with </span><span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> from a few minutes ago echoed in my head. We needed to find a main event that would have people wanting to come back and see our nation again. That’s why we planned the opera house, the colosseum, and the health resort. But I was also been thinking about whether there could be other attractions. After all, doing the same thing all the time will eventually get stale.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2095"><span class="indent"><span>Besides, martial tournaments couldn’t be held every day. At most we could hold four events in a year, considering it would be most appropriate to hold once per season. The same logic applied to horse racing. Content for ordinary folk to watch could be played every day, but these shows alone wouldn’t be able to attract the nobles who had grown a hard-to-satisfy appetite.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2096"><span class="indent"><span>Considering this, our main customers would be average civilians and foreign adventurers. This town was designed with logistical flow in mind, so merchants would definitely be visiting, the adventurers acting as their guards in tow, so I hoped they would consider this as a base.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2097"><span class="indent"><span>An adventurer had many jobs to do, one of them being eliminating </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. If I were to create a labyrinth here and fill it with </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>… In this way, wouldn’t we be drawing a massive crowd every day?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2098"><span class="indent"><span>Speaking of labyrinths, there was none that could top an underground labyrinth. If we invited people to try and conquer the labyrinth, there may even be adventurers visiting for the sole purpose of exploration.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2099"><span class="italic indent"><span>Yes, this may actually work.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2100"><span class="indent"><span>I turned to Ramiris who was looking up at me with an awkward smile. She was kinda… No, very unreliable, but this may just work. I’d made up my mind and decided to discuss my idea with Ramiris.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2101"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="text-center indent line" id="line_2102"><span class="indent"><span>***</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2103"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2104"><span class="indent"><span>I asked </span><span data-term="Gobkyu" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> to direct the workers to dismantle the shack. But since the work was already in progress, we decided to change this place to a resting shack for the gatekeeper.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2105"><span class="indent"><span>Next, we held a strategic meeting. With </span><span data-term="Gobkyu" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> in tow, we went to the meeting room that was often used.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2106"><span class="indent"><span>“Q-Question please?

It was probably because of her crisis senses. She kept on peeking at me.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2108"><span class="indent"><span>“You don’t have to force yourself to act so courteously. Besides, not all of your words were as humble as you think, even the way you addressed yourself sounded weird.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2109"><span class="indent"><span>That’s why I hoped she could just use her normal tone to talk. I didn’t intend to do anything to Ramiris anyway. If she accepted my proposal, I was willing to overlook the whole charade put on by her. But before that, I needed to confirm a few things.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2110"><span class="indent"><span>“</span><span data-term="Gobkyu" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, I want to create an evacuation space under the colosseum, is it possible?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2111"><span class="indent"><span>“Even calculating based on the strength of an individual executive, the area under the stage is still not very safe.

I just wanted Ramiris to use her power to create and run an underground labyrinth. Rather than building the entrance in some shack, we should prepare something more fitting and majestic. Since we’d defined it as basement level, it shouldn’t be a problem to build a colosseum on top of it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2122"><span class="indent"><span>The colosseum could provide amateur adventurers with lessons and instructions, and stores to sell healing potions were also expected to be set up. If we ran an underground labyrinth like that, adventurers who were done with their business might grab a drink on their way home, so those stores and restaurants would also prosper along the way. Then I’d be able to grab money from the adventurers, and Ramiris would also have a place to live, not to mention a job. I would even give her pocket money. This idea required mutual cooperation, but it might just turn into something interesting.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2123"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris began to shout excitedly after hearing my words.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2124"><span class="indent"><span>“Eh-EHEH! Could you be saying that you are giving me some amazing job on top of allowing us to create the labyrinth and live here?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2125"><span class="indent"><span>“If you accept my proposal, that would indeed be the case.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2126"><span class="indent"><span>“Eh? Then, then, do you mean that I have a chance to overcome this unbearable state of being a NEET—?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2127"><span class="indent"><span>She seemed downright shocked after hearing my plan. Ramiris’s eyes widened as if she’d been hit by lightning, even the way she spoke began to sound incoherent.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2128"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san saw this with tears in her eyes and said: “This is wonderful, Ramiris-sama.” For some reason, I felt a smile on Beretta’s face. The exhausted look he gave before appeared to be an act, now he looked positively delighted.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2129"><span class="indent"><span>Could it be that Beretta had hoped things would develop this way too?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2130"><span class="indent"><span>It could be, or not. In any case, it’s fine as long as he was happy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2131"><span class="indent"><span>“Q-Question… Did you mean it when you said that you will give me pocket money?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2132"><span class="indent"><span>She seemed to have calmed down.

She appeared to be afraid that I would respond with “Never mind that”.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2133"><span class="italic indent"><span>How would I say something like that, I’m not that mean, really! But depending on the amount of income, I can’t really promise you how much you are getting though… But that would at least reassure her a little bit.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2134"><span class="indent"><span>“That’s real. The only thing is we won’t know how much profit we are getting until we try. Regardless, subtracting the necessary expenses such as promotional fees and venue rent, you get to keep two percent of remaining profits, what do you think?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2135"><span class="indent"><span>“B-Based on that, how much money would that be?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2136"><span class="indent"><span>“About that, if we assume a thousand or so adventurers visiting a day, your portion would be around two gold coins?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2137"><span class="indent"><span>“GUU! I-I get to earn that much money!?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2138"><span class="indent"><span>“Those are just estimates, whether it can be carried out successfully is still unknown. After all, there’s not much of a show to put on if there is no audience. That being said, since you are already settling in here, isn’t there no loss to you regardless?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2139"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris nodded heavily in response to my question.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2140"><span class="indent"><span>She came to live here without permission, and I knew, without her saying, that I'd be the one maintaining the labyrinth. If that is the case, she’d be better off just accepting my deal. After hearing my permission for her to live and make money, Ramiris had only one reaction, that was to hug onto my head and shout excitedly.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2141"><span class="indent"><span>Since Ramiris had already accepted it, Beretta and </span><span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san naturally would not object.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2142"><span class="indent"><span>“Uhehe… Now I will become rich as well.

Perhaps she was too idle and lonely. For Ramiris’s and my own sake, I hope there will be adventurers visiting. In order to achieve that, let’s quickly come up with a plan to make that happen.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2150"><span class="indent"><span>After calling back Ramiris, whose mind had taken a trip, we began to draft the design graph for the colosseum construction.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2151"><span class="indent"><span>My plans were as follows:</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2152"><span class="indent"><span>Outside the west gate, there was a plaza at the end of the road. We'd expand the plaza first, then start the construction. Since there was plenty of space, we could also open up a stable for the travelers to rest their horses in. In the future we would be adding tracks on the streets for trains to run on. I recalled planning for trains in hopes that royalty would ride on them. If we could ensure the safety of travel routes, it would be easy to attract wealthy tourists. That, of course, would not be the only purpose of trains. With them we would be able to transport large amounts of cargo. This infrastructure would likely also contribute significantly to the city’s development.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2153"><span class="indent"><span>Since part of this plan was a scheme with the hope of developing the city, I hoped for it to work out well without complications. We might even set up a station near the colosseum… It would become a burden for the tourists if the distance were too far, so the standard would be within an hour’s walk from the gate. Having a location near the town would be better. Because the tourists would be walking, we would get customers at the inns along the route. Unlike my original world, people mostly relied on their legs to travel in this world. Most people could easily walk back and forth for tens of kilometers. So it shouldn’t be an issue to have some distance between buildings.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2154"><span class="indent"><span>Keeping these factors in mind, I considered the location for construction—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2155"><span class="indent"><span>“Why? Isn’t there any empty lot in the town as well?” Ramiris pointed out and corrected me.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2156"><span class="indent"><span>“Those are used as shelters for the </span><span data-term="beastmen" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.

I heard that there used to be spirits inhabiting the labyrinth before. That location had not yet disappeared but was stored in another level to isolate it from the outside world. It was also said that they were free to come in and out. If that’s the case, we would be able to fill the labyrinth with </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> for adventurers to challenge.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2189"><span class="indent"><span>Moreover, if you filled it with an abundance of magicule, </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> would be born naturally.

After one change, it would remain fixed for twenty-four hours. That came, of course, with additional conditions. You couldn’t make something out of nothing. It seemed that there was no way to generate organism such as vegetation, so we could only rely on creating inorganic walls to make the labyrinth… But it was not actually changing the whole structure, only the interior design of it that we’d prepared, this way it wouldn’t cost too much time. By the way, it was also very simple to swap floors. The previously stated rules applied, meaning every twenty-four hours only one change was permitted, but it was still very convenient.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2194"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2195"><span class="indent"><span>Fifth,</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2196"><span class="indent"><span>This was honestly surprising, but what happened when you died inside could be altered by Ramiris’s will. Provided she was aware of the situation, Ramiris could even resurrect the dead. I was still contemplating what to do about the disposal of </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ corpses and such and how to deal with the unfortunate deaths some adventurers might suffer. Well, as it turned out I heard something very unexpected.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2197"><span class="indent"><span>We didn’t have any examples of </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> born in the labyrinth to judge yet. However, Ramiris mentioned that she had resurrected adventurers several times before.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2198"><span class="indent"><span>The secret behind this was related to the “Permission of the target”, as mentioned by Ramiris before. It wasn’t an exaggeration but apparently the will of “I would like to go in” was crucial. It was a pre-condition, without which entering the labyrinth was impossible. It was the same reason why I was able to enter the labyrinth before. If you tried to bring someone asleep inside, you would be blocked at the entrance.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2199"><span class="indent"><span>Infants were exceptions. Children of young age have yet to form free will, so they appeared to be considered as goods and would gain protection. It was not impossible to force someone into entering the labyrinth, but this would also create a lot of pressure on Ramiris, such an action might fail due to the repulsive effect. So she wasn’t willing to spend time doing such a boring thing.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2200"><span class="indent"><span>That’s about it, the prelude stops here.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2201"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2202"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris had the ability to rule over the people who entered the labyrinth. With that being said however, it still required the person’s consent. If they were willing to accept Ramiris’s management, she would be able to keep track of their status at any instant.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2203"><span class="indent"><span>“That’s right, didn’t we really enjoy pranks? We just wanted to have fun watching how shocked people looked, but my conscience won’t sit well if they had actually died. That’s why we always knew when to stop and allowed people to return alive,” Ramiris proclaimed with her chest high.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2204"><span class="indent"><span>There were people who were unlucky and died, but that probably happened outside of the labyrinth. After all, Ramiris had no intention of killing me either back then.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2205"><span class="indent"><span>And there was also the golem that tried to kill me, did they put that thing there knowing that people could be resurrected? I had wanted to ask, “What type of trial is this”, but now it made more sense.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2206"><span class="indent"><span>“In other words, even if adventurers enter the labyrinth to eliminate </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> they won’t get killed and can be revived?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2207"><span class="indent"><span>“Yes. As soon as they are thrown out of the labyrinth they will appear as if nothing had happened when they are resurrected from death. But it would be problematic when the number becomes too large, so it should be best to have them wear the items I’ve prepared for resurrection.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2208"><span class="indent"><span>With the identification items crafted by Ramiris using ‘</span><span data-term="Labyrinth Creation" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’, people could be </span></span><span class="indent"><span>revived</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;outside the labyrinth if they died.

After being immersed in </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-sama’s mana, it will grow—evolve.

As of this moment, we were still researching with other equipment and the crucial magic crystals for enchanting the slots had yet to be completed. Drilling slots alone would be meaningless, so it was no use for me to be anxious about it. I decided to wait and look forward to the arrival of that day.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2340"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2341"><span class="indent"><span>Having received my own special sword, I departed from </span><span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s workshop happily. Additionally, I had the equipment I came for in tow. I’d put these items in the treasure chests and deploy them in the labyrinth. The equipment with higher quality would be guarded by the floor guardians (boss of each level), it would be pretty interesting. This almost felt like crafting a real dungeon labyrinth, how exciting.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2342"><span class="indent"><span>Indeed, these experimental or even failed works could still earn quite a lot of money from being auctioned off directly. If I asked </span><span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and Fuze for help, they would probably secure a tidy profit in their own way. It would be more pragmatic, but we shouldn’t do it. The important thing here was the exchange between </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and humans.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2343"><span class="indent"><span>I wanted to attract people to visit my kingdom and let them experience the beauty of Tempest Federation. In addition, I wanted them to feel the charm of this nation in person so that they would return again. We should consider the equipment as a small cost to reach that goal.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2344"><span class="indent"><span>Besides, things were not over after I delivered the items. I already had outlines for the future. The adventurers would infiltrate the underground labyrinth to bring back all sorts of items. Given it was extremely dangerous to use un-appraised weapons or gear, it was time for the “Appraisal Shop” to shine. Since all these items were crafted in our nation, we would also have complete knowledge of their effects. As long as the method of using them was not mistaken, many of these items could be useful in their adventures. There were some dangerous items included as I’ve mentioned, but I thought it would be fine if our nation bought those items back.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2345"><span class="indent"><span>Money needed to flow in order to have value, it was meaningless to only fill our own wallet. First, it was imperative to buy back necessary ingredients, and then pay the expenses to some extent, the rest we could even give back to the adventurers. After some time, adventurers would naturally begin to spread the news and so the reputation of our nation would increase. All of this hinged upon our ability to retain a steady stream of customers to make good use of the buildings we constructed, not to mention the amazing promotional impact it was going to have. We should strive to make our investments count.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2346"><span class="indent"><span>The southeast area would have the colosseum built with Ramiris’s underground labyrinth beneath it. There were also inns and civilian houses charging a fair price on the southwest side. Unlike the northeastern block with many classy hotels, the facilities there would be more down to earth. This place would primarily appeal to adventurers, with the added benefit of keeping different classes separate. It was also most convenient to visit the labyrinth from there, so business would definitely be booming.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2347"><span class="indent"><span>When Ramiris said that she wanted to move here, I was still worried about what to do. In terms of results, I suppose I had made the right call.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2348"><span class="indent"><span>As far as the Colosseum was concerned, we would be hosting one or two major events every year. Beyond that, we would organize all kinds of events on normal days as well. Military training or events for adventurers to test their skills, to name a few. There were actually plenty of activities if I thought about it carefully. Underneath in the underground labyrinth, we could also run field experiments and examine the results. Since we couldn’t die while inside, we might even do some dangerously excessive and over-the-top training.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2349"><span class="indent"><span>Perhaps it could be for more than just commercial usage, there were plenty of areas it could be applied—concerning these ideas, I decided to discuss things with </span><span data-term="Benimaru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2350"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="text-center indent line" id="line_2351"><span class="indent"><span>***</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2352"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2353"><span class="indent"><span>So we had our “bait”.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2354"><span class="indent"><span>But right now it was too early to decide exactly how the underground labyrinth would be used. I want to ponder on it after it was complete. In order to complete the final step, I decided to negotiate with a key figure.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2355"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2356"><span class="indent"><span>The key figure of this plan—Veldora-san.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2357"><span class="indent"><span>He was currently resting in the garden hut at my estate. The lone estate was like a tearoom with the Japanese style of quiet beauty. In fact, this place had a secret—uh, I’ll put that aside for now. Let’s just say that Veldora has become used to staying there and considers it his home.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2358"><span class="indent"><span>Whatever really…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2359"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2360"><span class="indent"><span>“Hey, Veldora. I’ve got a request for you, is it okay?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2361"><span class="indent"><span>“Uh? What is it, I’m pretty busy.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2362"><span class="italic indent"><span>Hmm, I see that you are reading manga, so yeah, there’s no way you’re not free</span></span><span class="indent"><span>.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2363"><span class="indent"><span>“Is that so…what a pity then. That’s a waste of such an interesting thing… But since you’re busy then it can’t be helped. It’s such a rare chance for you to release your—oh, you are busy. Sorry that I bothered you.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2364"><span class="indent"><span>Saying this, I pretended to leave. Although this was basically me leaving my own room, which made me feel kind of bad, there was plenty of places to spend the night. And even with that being said—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2365"><span class="indent"><span>“Umm, hol’ up. I’m a busy man indeed, but since it is you who came asking, it can’t be helped. Tell me about it!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2366"><span class="italic indent"><span>So did he really bite?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2367"><span class="italic indent"><span>Gullible as always.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2368"><span class="indent"><span>Veldora-san had the nickname of “Gullidora”</span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;This is actually &quot;グエルドラ&quot;, Gueredora, but basically, it’s just a pun name to say Veldora is very gullible.

I’d known for a while that he was easily tricked. To me, outsmarting this guy was like twisting the hands of an infant. And given this was the case, what came next was much easier. I pretended to be deep while phrasing things very intriguingly.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2369"><span class="indent"><span>“The thing is, I plan to design a home just for you…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2370"><span class="indent"><span>“W-What are you talking about? Building a place just for me, is this true?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2371"><span class="indent"><span>He had taken the bait. His eyes left the manga, and he began to pay attention to my words intently.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2372"><span class="indent"><span>“That’s right! built just for you. But if you are so busy—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2373"><span class="indent"><span>“Wait, don’t be so hasty. You and I go way back after all, so of course I’ll prioritize your request, GA-HAHAHA!” Veldora-san said that so arrogantly.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2374"><span class="indent"><span>But this was good.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2375"><span class="indent"><span>Seeing that he was waiting for me to continue, I might just tell him now.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2376"><span class="indent"><span>Veldora often didn’t listen and I was forced into tricking him. Troublesome as it was, it remained the necessary ritual to draw his attention.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2377"><span class="indent"><span>“So…some people need to make friends.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2378"><span class="indent"><span>“Hmmhmm, just speak your mind with the request!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2379"><span class="indent"><span>“The thing is, Ramiris is moving to town. We are building that girl’s labyrinth right under the colosseum and then—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2380"><span class="indent"><span>While he was still interested to hear me out, I told him about Ramiris moving in. Veldora understood faster than I expected.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2381"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh, is it Ramiris? I’m not entirely sure about that girl’s ability, but I think she has the power to create tunnels that will lead to the same location no matter which entrance on the surface is taken. Is she able to create a labyrinth with complex layouts?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2382"><span class="indent"><span>“Right. She is also planning to add floors and I am thinking about preparing different types of traps.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2383"><span class="indent"><span>“There are even floors? I see, that chibi Ramiris seems to be stronger than I imagined.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2384"><span class="indent"><span>Upon hearing me say so, Veldora mirrored my serious expression. </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>You really are so, so gullible</span></span><span class="indent"><span>. Next, I shared the entirety of the underground labyrinth creation plan with Veldora.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2385"><span class="indent"><span>“Isn’t it boring to just have an ordinary labyrinth? That’s why I’m trying to make it something awesome, a national brand. And today, I just discussed it with Ramiris. She is now working hard on expanding the floors.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2386"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh oh. So what does it have to do with your favor from me?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2387"><span class="indent"><span>“Honestly, I need a king to rule over the underground labyrinth—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2388"><span class="indent"><span>“—You say king?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2389"><span class="indent"><span>“The management of the labyrinth will be run by Ramiris and me. Then there is a gate on the hundredth floor that leads to Ramiris’s home within the fairy maze. A guardian is required for that gate—no, we need the ‘Strongest’ guardian. Don’t you think that makes sense, Veldora-kun?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2390"><span class="indent"><span>“It makes sense! I see, as expected of </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. So you want to hand that job to me, am I right?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2391"><span class="indent"><span>As predicted, Veldora had been fooled by my sweet-talk. Since he didn’t have much resistance against the word “Strongest”, I figured I could definitely lure him into agreement with that.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2392"><span class="indent"><span>“That’s right, Veldora. Moreover, if you agree to this proposal, there’s another bonus waiting for you.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2393"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh? Although I’ve already decided to agree, let me hear about this bonus first.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2394"><span class="indent"><span>Hehehe. This was not just a bonus; it was actually the most important reason.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2395"><span class="indent"><span>“Didn’t you want to release your </span><span data-term="youki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> all the time? And that you were almost at your limit?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2396"><span class="indent"><span>“What! Could it be…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2397"><span class="indent"><span>“Bingo! You don’t have to hold back your </span><span data-term="youki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> any more in the labyrinth. You can even return to your original dragon form.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2398"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh, ohoh…!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2399"><span class="indent"><span>“Think about it, a handsome dragon waiting at the depths of the labyrinth, giving off a solemn aura—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2400"><span class="indent"><span>“That’s me, right?” Veldora interrupted. “If that’s the case, I also get to unapologetically say to people: ‘GAHAHAHAHAHA, you’ve finally arrived! Welcome, pathetic bugs!’ and show off a little?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2401"><span class="indent"><span>He was already dying to give it a try. At the beginning he didn’t even seem to have a single scrap of motivation, but upon hearing that he got to release his </span><span data-term="youki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, he appeared to be very excited.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2402"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2403"><span class="italic indent"><span>How about I give it a final blow to seal the deal?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2404"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2405"><span class="indent"><span>Thinking about it, I began to mention the final plan that I’d discussed with Ramiris.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2406"><span class="indent"><span>“I’ll also be deploying some of my men there to defend against the adventurers. Yes, this is a game you’ve wanted to play for a while—I want to make it a reality. So, does it sound like fun?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2407"><span class="indent"><span>I expected to make the underground labyrinth into something resembling a realistic simulation game. After hearing Ramiris’s view, I suddenly got an idea.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2408"><span class="italic indent"><span>Deploying my men—aka </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> to fight and defeat adventurers. In order to guard the treasure chests, there will also be </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> bosses. Veldora’s magicules will flood the underground labyrinth. Starting at the one hundredth floor, where the magicule concentration will be strongest, it will gradually thin out as it spreads across the floors above, which will have the desired effect of spawning relatively weak </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> in the upper floors, but progressively tougher ones lower down. The magicules leaked by Veldora during his sealed state was enough to spawn strong </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> such as Tempest Snakes at Rank A-. If it is Veldora now, I can’t fathom how strong the </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> will be.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2409"><span class="indent"><span>Honestly, there really was no need to deploy guardians. I didn’t see anyone even arriving at the hundredth floor, so there shouldn’t be such worries. The most important thing was having Veldora release his </span><span data-term="youki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. I figured that after telling him to endure, he was at his limit. If I left him unattended, he might find a place to relieve himself without permission when no one was watching, that’s why I had to keep my eyes on him at all times.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2410"><span class="indent"><span>If he accidentally released it in this region, apart from my executives and myself, any average people would be unable to tolerate it. With the magicule concentration spiking, people below Rank B might easily be killed. It would be asking too much to hope that Veldora would understand restraint, so Ramiris’s labyrinth was to be a facilitating factor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2411"><span class="indent"><span>After all, the interior of the labyrinth was an isolated space. I had confirmed that while exploring it in the past, there was no need to worry about magicule leakage. Moreover, even if Veldora released his </span><span data-term="youki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, it wouldn’t shake the place. Even the sealed cave was unable to contain the </span><span data-term="youki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> released by Veldora after his full revival. Now that we established a research facility there, I couldn’t allow him to release it in the cave again… That’s why the underground labyrinth was the ideal venue.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2412"><span class="indent"><span>Then there’s also the ultimate goal, the hope that Veldora would release his </span><span data-term="youki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> completely—simultaneously preparing high concentrations of magicules to spawn </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. That was after all the core of this plan. Not only would we have Veldora release his </span><span data-term="youki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, but we would be capitalizing on it effectively. How do I come up with these amazing ideas? It’s killing two birds with one stone, actually, I should call it killing three birds. Not only would I be able to chase out Veldora who had been laying his nest in my house, I could have him be the magicule generator in the labyrinth to spawn </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. Moreover, I got to give some work to this Veldora who had almost turned into a NEET.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2413"><span class="indent"><span>Sadly for him, I didn’t think he would ever get the chance to play the part of the King of the Labyrinth (Last Boss)…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2414"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2415"><span class="italic indent"><span>Alright, shall we see how he’ll react?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2416"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2417"><span class="indent"><span>Veldora stood up and sneakily put his manga into his pocket.

This thing sounds very interesting, </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. Adventurers will fend off the minions and stand before me. Then I will get to teach these strong individuals a lesson. Of course, some adventurers will attempt to run away, but I will not let them off so easily! When times like that come, how about I say something like—‘GAHAHAHAHAHA, you can’t escape from my grasp. Don’t you know? No one escapes from the claws of the one and only </span><span data-term="Storm Dragon" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>—’ I always wanted to try this line. Now am I finally getting the chance to deliver the line that I’ve been hoping to declare for so long? How exciting, I’m really looking forward to it!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2419"><span class="indent"><span>Spouting things like that, Veldora had now even begun daydreaming.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2420"><span class="indent"><span>“Y-Yeah, you’re right…” I gave the affirmative to him without thinking, but I might have gotten Veldora too excited…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2421"><span class="italic indent"><span>Will this guy be alright like this?

I played him like a fiddle…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2425"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2426"><span class="indent"><span>And like that, I got Veldora’s assistance with ease.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2427"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="text-center indent line" id="line_2428"><span class="indent"><span>***</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2429"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2430"><span class="indent"><span>The next day—I paired up with Veldora to find Ramiris.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2431"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2432"><span class="indent"><span>The construction work on the colosseum started early in the morning.

Everyone was working their hardest, so in order to avoid disturbing them, we entered the labyrinth.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2433"><span class="indent"><span>Upon entry, we found ourselves in the same room Ramiris was in… As promised yesterday, she seemed to be diligently expanding the labyrinth all this time.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2434"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh, Ramiris. How are you doing?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2435"><span class="indent"><span>“Ah, mentor (shishou)! Long time no see, I’ve been good!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2436"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris looked worn out but very satisfied as she made the response. It seemed she had been working too hard, even though I specifically told her not to overdo her part. Without me noticing, she had already sat down on Veldora’s shoulder. The two looked so close, how wonderful.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2437"><span class="indent"><span>Despite the wonderful things, there were still some remaining problems. Ramiris apparently wanted to show off her skills some more now that Veldora had come, and she was completely ignoring my reminder.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2438"><span class="indent"><span>“Just count on me! I’ll work hard. I’ll definitely complete all of them!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2439"><span class="indent"><span>I just wanted Ramiris to calm down. The first thing we needed to do was to eat breakfast.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2440"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2441"><span class="indent"><span>After finishing breakfast, Ramiris explained her progress to me. She had increased the size to fifteen floors. At this rate, we would reach the one hundredth floor in just a few days. The internal structure would be changed on the fly, so Ramiris didn’t have to slow down for those plans.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2442"><span class="indent"><span>“Anyway, the rest of the floors will be expanding by themselves.” Ramiris said. “I’m pretty idle anyway, so why don’t I do the interior design for the finished floors too?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2443"><span class="indent"><span>It seemed that even without Ramiris’s conscious effort, the floors would increase automatically while consuming her power.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2444"><span class="indent"><span>“Then, let’s prepare Veldora’s room first.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2445"><span class="indent"><span>I planned to set Veldora’s residence at the deepest level. In order to chase him out of my room, we would decorate the interior of his room first.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2446"><span class="indent"><span>The bottom floor right now was a room devoid of anything. There were no walls, and naturally no hallways. There weren’t even any stairs, we could only see an empty lot with a gate.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2447"><span class="indent"><span>“This is truly empty I see.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2448"><span class="indent"><span>“Oi oi oi, </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, is this supposed to be my room? This really reminds me of the spot where I was sealed before…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2449"><span class="indent"><span>Veldora seemed kind of repulsed. That’s somewhat pitiful really.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2450"><span class="indent"><span>“It’s alright, mentor! If I want, I can easily create walls and stairs.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2451"><span class="indent"><span>Seeing how displeased Veldora looked, Ramiris replied grinning.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2452"><span class="indent"><span>“Right, then, regarding what type of room we are decorating, we will discuss through our ‘Telepathy Net’ and decide.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2453"><span class="indent"><span>With that being said, I promptly connected the three of us with ‘Telepathy Net’. Then we began to construct an outline for the style of decoration based on my thoughts.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2454"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh, ohoh! That’s it, that’s it, </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>! You are truly impressive. I see that there’s really nothing for me to worry about when you are handling things.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2455"><span class="italic indent"><span>Did your satisfaction rate just suddenly cap out just like that?</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;Veldora nodded while humming “Hmmhmm”.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2456"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2457"><span class="indent"><span>“It seems that Veldora is completely satisfied, can we decorate it to this type of style?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2458"><span class="indent"><span>“Just count on me! This is a piece of cake!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2459"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris took on the mission without hesitation. And just like she put it, the empty lot was changed in the blink of an eye. The walls turned into thick and heavy stone walls, several small rooms and a hall appeared. The hall was square shaped with one hundred meters for each side. The solemn atmosphere of the interior design resembled the so called “</span><span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> level”</span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Honestly, the term “Demon Lord” has been translated to “Demon King”, “Monster King” before, so just imagine this is. " onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent"><span>(Final Boss Level). I transmitted the image in my head to her, and it turned out that she was able to recreate it wholly intact.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2460"><span class="indent"><span>“You are so strong! This is just perfect…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2461"><span class="indent"><span>“Hmm, Ramiris, now I am satisfied!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2462"><span class="indent"><span>“Right, right! I am super strong after all!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2463"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris probably seldom got praised by people, which was why she was overjoyed now. But even with that being said, she had been truly impressive this time. Building something like this in real life would likely not just take several years, but perhaps even decades to finish. Yet she completed it in the blink of an eye… It seemed that Ramiris held ultimate power over the underground labyrinth and had complete freedom in shaping it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2464"><span class="italic indent"><span>Ah, that’s impressive, impressive indeed. I’ve completely changed my mind on Ramiris and now see her in a different light. But next, being impressed here alone won’t make any progress.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2465"><span class="indent"><span>On the surface it appeared that this hall was a room to confront adventurers. But its true purpose was to allow Veldora to restore his original form. So if Veldora was unable to properly relax here, the effort would’ve been meaningless.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2466"><span class="indent"><span>However, based on Veldora’s recent activities, he did seem remarkably relaxed even without being in his dragon form… Since transforming into his human form, he could read manga and play games. This must’ve been the case. After all, he decided to stay in my room without leaving. Based on this, I decided to prepare a room tailored to his human form as well.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2467"><span class="indent"><span>There were two gates in this hall. One of the large gates connected to the stairs to the upper floor, and the other gate lead to his private room for everyday use. Ramiris’s ability to recreate things was indeed powerful, she could construct an exact replica of what I envisioned.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2468"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh? Is this my room?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2469"><span class="indent"><span>While ignoring the intrigued Veldora, I took out a whole set of furniture from my ‘Stomach’. I laid out the rug stitched by the goblinas and put out the tables and chairs built by the craftsmen. I’d even prepared benches, so he could lie down for a while if he wished. I even put out a bed, though I wasn’t sure about whether it was necessary or not.</span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;(D: Inb4 doujin, O: No, I assure you that it is probably far too late for that.)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span></p><hr class="indent line" id="line_2470"><p class="indent line" id="line_2471"><span class="indent"></span></p><img alt="" src="/ln/v8/images/image10.jpg" title="" class="line" id="line_2472"><p class="indent line" id="line_2473"><span class="italic indent"><span>I think this will create a very comfortable space</span></span><span class="indent"><span>. There were also shelves set on the walls with copies of the manga that Veldora liked. Unlike the solemn atmosphere the hall projected, this was built to be a comfortable space for private life that a commoner would enjoy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2474"><span class="indent"><span>“Nicu, nicu, very nicu, </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-chan. I want that type of furniture too!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2475"><span class="indent"><span>After hearing how envious Ramiris sounded, I promised her that I would prepare a set for her as well. While I was originally worried about the size problem, that seemed to be unnecessary. Ramiris jumped onto the bench without hesitation and began to flip through manga. Speaking of this, it was the same during our last meeting. So I shouldn’t overthink it and just prepare another set.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2476"><span class="indent"><span>Without me noticing, even Veldora had begun to play around and started rolling on the bed. He looked contented. The hall had an emphasis on atmosphere, the majesty of that in contrast to this room and how Veldora was behaving stood in stark contrast. </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>Right, there are things we just can’t force</span></span><span class="indent"><span>. On this day we managed to sort out Veldora’s room and with that dismissed our meeting.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2477"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2478"><span class="indent"><span>After that, it took another whole week. Although we had slowed down a bit, the labyrinth had finally been built to a hundred floors. The interior designs were developed with modularity in mind. Thanks to this function, we were able to do an internal structural change every few days. Adventurers trying to memorize the layout would soon realize how futile those attempts would be. This design was truly evil.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2479"><span class="indent"><span>Selling maps would be an option, however it would ruin the fun adventurers would have when they’re forced to create a new map every time they enter. But to put it in another light, they wouldn’t get bored this way… The labyrinth would always have a certain level of difficulty when being conquered, so that will never get old.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2480"><span class="indent"><span>We at the very least had some measures to save progress. We placed a save point for every ten floors. I didn’t expect that in Ramiris’s labyrinth, you could conduct ‘Spatial Transportation’ upon fulfilling certain conditions. More surprisingly, the act was said to be unaffected by magicule. It could even transport rations, which made it an extremely convenient function.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2481"><span class="indent"><span>Of course, the same applied to humans and could transport them freely to any specific location. That was a save point. Once you reached it, you got to start from there in your next run. The same transportation method could be used by your companions too, so you could basically also cheat by having other people send you to a certain location.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2482"><span class="indent"><span>We had differing views on this issue, but in the end, we took my suggestion to see how things would shape up before deciding on anything. Honestly speaking, cheating using savepoints would only give the people doing this a hard time. Since we were planning to put a boss on each floor. As the regional ruler of Jura Great Forest, I thought floor guardians were necessary components. Especially before reaching the save point set every ten floors, I wanted to deploy some especially strong </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2483"><span class="indent"><span>In other words, you couldn’t use the save point unless you defeated these powerful individuals. If they were capable enough to break through, the companions brought by these strong individuals surely wouldn’t be reckless. But if there was truly any problem, we would think about what to do by that time. In addition, I also wanted to prepare some treasure chests as rewards to incentivize defeating the bosses.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2484"><span class="italic indent"><span>But is it okay if the bosses are defeated?</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;Indeed, that was an important question. One of the abilities of Ramiris’s ‘</span><span data-term="Labyrinth Creation" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ was—the power of resurrection. Thanks to this skill, the adventurers inside it got to be revived.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2485"><span class="indent"><span>As explained before, it required the will of the person, but the step would not be required if the individual had a ruler-subject relation with Ramiris. To my surprise, through the labyrinth created by ‘</span><span data-term="Labyrinth Creation" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’, Ramiris’s subordinates seemed to be immortal. Ramiris would disappear upon being killed, but her subordinates could be revived at the save points. As for the subordinates we were referring to here, it applied only to those, who had forged a pact with her or to people that Ramiris acknowledged. This skill was undoubtedly a ferocious power beyond my imagination.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2486"><span class="indent"><span>That was the biggest reason why she wanted Beretta. Ramiris herself was not that strong, but Ramiris’s army inside the labyrinth was invincible. That was why to Ramiris, who didn’t have a single subordinate, this invincible skill was as good as none at all. It was no use if it was a golem without will. The reason why the Golem of Holy Spirit (Elemental Golem) was destroyed is due to the fact that it was merely a doll.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2487"><span class="indent"><span>Considering that, Beretta was no mere doll. After becoming Ramiris’s subordinate, Beretta practically became immortal</span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;To be more specific, the term here is “不滅” (cannot be destroyed)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;within this labyrinth. With the addition of </span><span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san now, Ramiris packed quite a bit more military power than I had initially expected. After all, the two were already very powerful before, now given the attribute of immortality, it was hard to say who would win even if I sent out </span><span data-term="Benimaru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and </span><span data-term="Shion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> to confront them. Powerhouses such as Beretta and </span><span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san were now also very busy, but they had no complaints as they assisted the construction of the colosseum outside…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2488"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2489"><span class="indent"><span>Thanks to Ramiris, the labyrinth had smoothly entered a stage of near completion. Once this thing was settled, I’d better find them both to discuss the defense mechanisms inside the labyrinth. However, that would come later.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2490"><span class="indent"><span>“Ramiris, how is the item I asked you to prepare coming along?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2491"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh, you mean this? I’ve been trying to craft one.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2492"><span class="indent"><span>The thing I asked her to prepare was the resurrection item. In order to obtain the attribute of “Immortality” from Ramiris’s ‘</span><span data-term="Labyrinth Creation" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’, she must first receive confirmation of the individual’s will. But it was to be expected that everyone who wanted to enter the labyrinth would use one. Since this was a facility accessible to anyone—it was simply too hard to confirm the personal will and form a pact with everyone. If there weren’t a lot of people, Ramiris should be able to maintain control, but if too many people came in at the same time, Ramiris might not be able to keep up. That’s why she designed a single-use disposable item—that’s how she described it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2493"><span class="indent"><span>She took out a bracelet that, upon first glance, seemed like nothing special. It looked like a braided bracelet that you could tie on your wrist.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2494"><span class="indent"><span>“About this thing, have you confirmed the effect?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2495"><span class="indent"><span>“It works great! I tried it on Beretta last night!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2496"><span class="indent"><span>“Hold up, hold up, why are you so mean to Beretta…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2497"><span class="indent"><span>I never expected that Beretta would say “I’m a </span><span data-term="demon" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, so I won’t get eliminated regardless” at the time and offered his help happily. Although this was a request from me, they were still too reckless.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2498"><span class="indent"><span>But that was worth the try, it was very useful in confirming the effect of the bracelet. Ten seconds after </span><span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san had pierced Beretta’s core, his corpse was transported outside the underground labyrinth and was completely revived.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2499"><span class="indent"><span>“It seems perfect. I appreciate Beretta’s courage.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2500"><span class="indent"><span>“Hmm hmm. This is my first time making a single-use disposable item. Although I guessed it would come out smoothly, it’s truly wonderful that I was actually able to make it,” Ramiris nodded with a smile, it did sound like it was her first attempt.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2501"><span class="indent"><span>It was worthy of celebration that it had been successful, but it was truly frightening to think of what would have happened had it failed. At least do an animal experiment first. I should be mindful of her doing something this reckless in future requests.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2502"><span class="indent"><span>Regardless, the resurrection item had been prepared. The emergency escape item for returning to the surface also seemed to have been finished.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2503"><span class="indent"><span>“</span><span data-term="Revival Bracelet" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>”, “Return Whistle”—these we would be selling at the entrance of the labyrinth to prepare for the unknown. Whether the customers bought them or not was their choice. </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>However, please take responsibility for dying or getting lost in the labyrinth without the purchase.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2504"><span class="italic indent"><span>It is a buy from me, absolute buy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2505"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2506"><span class="indent"><span>I’d think about the price tag for it later. Regardless, the preparation work was done for now. By the way, this resurrection item called “</span><span data-term="Revival Bracelet" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>” actually only temporarily materialized Ramiris’s power. That’s why you could only be revived at the entrance after dying inside the labyrinth to be reset.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2507"><span class="indent"><span>In order to prevent anyone from misunderstanding its function and therefore expecting it to be able to revive them at any location, including outside of the labyrinth, we needed to give a thorough explanation. There were a lot of people in this world that ignored other people’s advice, so I was a bit worried. If they really mistook things and ended up dying outside the labyrinth, it would be their own doing. Either way, I still couldn’t bear to see that happening. I should just specifically remind the people to be careful with it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2508"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2509"><span class="indent"><span>With that, the underground labyrinth was almost complete.

There were air vents in this hundred-level underground labyrinth and stairs that connected the floors. If people asked me how there was any air flow one hundred floors underground, I would answer by saying it was all because of magic.

Right now there weren’t any walls set up nor any other sort of areal partitioning. That’s why there weren’t any obstacles that hindered the magicules from permeating to every corner of the space. Even around underground level fifty, the magicule concentration was beyond that in the “Sealed Cave”.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2548"><span class="indent"><span>Its effect had exceeded my expectations, so basically it was an absolute win.

I listed all the traps I could come up with to her and it turned out that almost all of them could be created.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2616"><span class="indent"><span>“You are truly capable, Ramiris. Are you really able to make these types of traps?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2617"><span class="indent"><span>“Hmm! Inside the labyrinth, </span></span><span class="indent"><span>I can make whatever I want!</span></span><span class="indent"><span>!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2618"><span class="indent"><span>Indeed, it was just like how Ramiris put it. Now even though we were one hundred floors down, the air composition was no different from that on the surface. This was all thanks to Ramiris’s skill. It illustrated once again how super strong her skill was.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2619"><span class="indent"><span>“By the way, what is this ‘Sealed Room’? Can it really be a booby trap?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2620"><span class="indent"><span>To her question, I cracked up a smile and replied, “Air—or I should say that there is a substance in the atmosphere called oxygen. Humans, or perhaps most creatures, will take in oxygen by breathing. Veldora and I are exceptions. If the concentration of oxygen drops too low, people will suffer hypoxia and may even die on the spot. That’s why adventurers should be cautious when faced with a room like that. After all, that’s a fixed rule of exploration.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2621"><span class="indent"><span>In general, it was fine if a room were sealed, but if you lit a fire inside, it would lead to a state of oxygen deprivation or may even cause the room to be filled with poisonous gases. Even if you discovered this type of room in ruins or labyrinths, you couldn’t immediately rush in. You must analyze the components of the atmosphere first and hold a skeptical view regarding whether there was poisonous gas remaining and assessing the concentration of the oxygen.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2622"><span class="indent"><span>That is the basic rule of exploration, if an adventurer can’t even do that, he won’t last long. And since magic exists in this world, at least do the breathing with wind-element magic.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2623"><span class="indent"><span>I explained this in a way that Ramiris could easily understand—although she didn’t seem to understand at all.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2624"><span class="indent"><span>“Okay, I get now that it is some vicious trap. But it doesn’t really affect us, so we don’t have to pay too much attention to it, right? By the way, you… I had the feeling before that you were a pretty scary guy. But you also seem very capable. If it were me, I wouldn’t be able to come up with a trap like that…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2625"><span class="indent"><span>Knowing that they themselves wouldn’t have to worry about being harmed by the trap, Ramiris seemed to be reassured. She exclaimed so and praised me. She seemed to really believe what she said, and that kind of embarrassed me. If it were people who enjoyed gaming from my original world, they should be very familiar with these traps and even feel somewhat intimate with them.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2626"><span class="indent"><span>But making them real is a horse of a different color. It was nothing like some amusement rides, you might pay with your life because of them. Moreover, attempting to overcome a labyrinth with these traps would likely take a couple of days. They might even take a few days just to take on a few levels, plus the terrain will alter, one must try to go all the way to the save point at the tenth floor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2627"><span class="indent"><span>If it was someone like us who had poison nullification and did not require breathing, eating or even sleeping, they should be able to conquer it using brute force by just tanking the damage. But this was not something average people were capable of. Even those who were worthy of the title of </span><span data-term="hero" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> would need to rest. I personally was convinced that it would be quite the vicious labyrinth.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2628"><span class="indent"><span>“Are we perhaps setting the difficulty too high?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2629"><span class="indent"><span>“Is it? I find it okay.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2630"><span class="indent"><span>“Yeah, </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. This is really nothing!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2631"><span class="indent"><span>My worries were laughed off by Veldora and Ramiris. If that’s the case, then there shouldn’t be a problem. I was persuaded and continued brainstorming the labyrinth routes.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2632"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2633"><span class="indent"><span>A few days passed after that, during which Ramiris joyfully prepared all sorts of traps. Beretta and </span><span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san had been deploying them alongside her. I had planned out the labyrinth route with Veldora. We came up with several different models and registered them first so we could make the change anytime we needed. Everything had been going smoothly, but when we attempted to add “Terrain Effect”, Ramiris raised an objection.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2634"><span class="indent"><span>“No, no no no. I can’t sustain that much energy!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2635"><span class="indent"><span>To put it simply, she had a problem with it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2636"><span class="indent"><span>—Actually, it made sense. In terms of the layout—we wanted every level to have a specific natural disaster theme that would cover the entire level. For example a fire level, frozen level or a storm level.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2637"><span class="italic indent"><span>Yeah, I guess creating a volcano is a no-go. I’ve come to believe that anything can be done with magic, but what I was asking for is simply too much.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2638"><span class="indent"><span>“I see you have a point. Sorry, Ramiris, I was being too difficult—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2639"><span class="indent"><span>I gave up and decided to apologize to Ramiris. But then—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2640"><span class="indent"><span>“Can’t that be solved if you capture a fire or ice dragon from somewhere? Do you need my help to catch some?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2641"><span class="indent"><span>What a familiar voice, but, that person shouldn’t be here. I turned around to see a pair of platinum pink ponytails.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2642"><span class="indent"><span>It was Milim.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2643"><span class="indent"><span>“Eh…? What are you doing here, Milim—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2644"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2645"><span class="indent"><span>This was level one hundred underground. In other words, this was the very bottom level of the recently built underground labyrinth. We hadn’t even made this location public, so by any rational logic she shouldn’t have been able to enter…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2646"><span class="indent"><span>Yet she just did—</span><span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> Milim stood there with a smug smile.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2647"><span class="indent"><span>By the way, </span><span data-term="Wisdom King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> Raphael-sensei seemed to have noticed that, but since Milim didn’t have hostile intent against me, it intentionally didn’t report to me… But actually, it was me who told it to do that. Though I should still reassess the command. It’s all because Raphael-san doesn’t know how to be flexible, what a headache.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2648"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2649"><span class="indent"><span>&lt;&lt;……&gt;&gt;</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2650"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2651"><span class="indent"><span>That will be a topic to discuss in the future, right now let’s deal with Milim. Upon thinking this, I turned to Milim. And soon after, she remarked complacently: “Fufu, I know that you guys have been up to something interesting, so I came by to see. And you’ve ousted me without notice, how dare you, </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2652"><span class="indent"><span>Milim finished with an arrogant posture while straightening her plotless, flat chest.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2653"><span class="indent"><span>She was wearing her usual highly revealing clothes, but the area covered by clothing seemed to be more than last time. After being dressed by </span><span data-term="Shuna" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and the goblinas, she may have become a bit more self-aware about dressing up in public. On her fists were the pair of drago knuckles that clashed with the rest of her attire. The light reflecting off its rough surface was emphasizing their existence. It was very much Milim’s style, she really was just a punk kid after all.</span></span></p><hr class="indent line" id="line_2654"><p class="indent line" id="line_2655"><span class="indent"></span></p><img alt="" src="/ln/v8/images/image6.jpg" title="" class="line" id="line_2656"><p class="indent line" id="line_2657"><span class="indent"><span>I couldn’t bring myself to reject her, so if she really wanted to join the development—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2658"><span class="indent"><span>“Heh, so it’s Milim. You are just a brat, how could you understand the sublime work of us adults? We are not playing around here, don’t get in our way!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2659"><span class="indent"><span>Veldora slanted towards Milim and exclaimed so while feeling justified. I didn’t have time to respond before he interjected. It was work in name indeed, but this didn’t seem like serious work at all… Not only him, even Ramiris decided to chase after Veldora’s footsteps.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2660"><span class="indent"><span>“Mentor is right!” she yelled, confronting Milim. “We are working here, so an idler like you should just go home!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2661"><span class="indent"><span>The poor chibi was immediately trapped in Milim’s iron grasp. Her courage was commendable, but Ramiris, you don’t really have the strength to back it up.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2662"><span class="indent"><span>I lacked that sort of courage, so I decided to ask in a normal way.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2663"><span class="indent"><span>“You mentioned that we are doing something interesting, what were you referring to? It was all because of your letter that we are holding this grand festival.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2664"><span class="indent"><span>“What? Didn’t you ignore my letter?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2665"><span class="indent"><span>“How is that possible? Seriously, we are doing this to receive </span><span data-term="demon" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> lords, so we can’t just offer the bare minimum, can we?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2666"><span class="indent"><span>Up until now Milim was looking displeased, but after learning that she hadn’t been ignored, she immediately regained her jovial mood, to the displeasure of someone else.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2667"><span class="indent"><span>“Hold on, </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>! I’m a </span><span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> too! I’m just like you and Milim, a member of the Octagram!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2668"><span class="indent"><span>Seeing that Milim had received different treatment than herself, Ramiris began to throw a tantrum.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2669"><span class="indent"><span>“Ramiris, there’s no such thing as receiving you at all, didn’t you move here without permission!?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2670"><span class="indent"><span>“What? What do you mean by moving here? Ramiris, could it be that you are living with </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> now?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2671"><span class="indent"><span>After being pursued by questions from Milim and me, Ramiris was now the one who had lost her cool—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2672"><span class="indent"><span>“That’s right! I was not invited, but that’s not important at all! Also I’m not gonna be alone in the future anymore now that I’m living with </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> too!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2673"><span class="indent"><span>—Or so I thought that she has just lost her cool, instead she dropped this easily misunderstood statement.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2674"><span class="indent"><span>“How cunning and cheeky of you! I want to live here too!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2675"><span class="indent"><span>“Hehe—! I came here for work. I’m helping </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, not a guest like you who can only give trouble to people.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2676"><span class="indent"><span>“What! How dare you say that, you are just a—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2677"><span class="indent"><span>Milim was furious and began to argue with Ramiris, who was not backing down either, even though she had no chance of winning, she accepted the challenge.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2678"><span class="indent"><span>As for me, I just stood back and watched to avoid being affected. With that being said, if Milim begins to resort to violence in her confrontation, there would be no need to use verbal arguments. That’s why their conflict was but a verbal quarrel. The two were arguing against each other, but it looked pretty pathetic since both were lacking in the vocabulary department. Their exchanges of insults were all awful and would probably only make any bystander laugh.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2679"><span class="indent"><span>Sometimes Ramiris would deliver a flying kick at Milim, to which Milim would chase after her in an attempt to grab onto Ramiris. It was like a game of tag, to any bystander, they would feel that they were just playing around with each other and they were actually on good terms. These two fellows had long been acquainted, so perhaps this was also a reflection of their affection for each other.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2680"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2681"><span class="indent"><span>Soon after, they suddenly held back midway through their quarrel, putting an abrupt end to the argument—because </span><span data-term="Shuna" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> came by with desserts prepared in hand and scolded the two upon seeing this.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2682"><span class="indent"><span>“No dessert for anyone who’s fighting!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2683"><span class="indent"><span>And because of these words, the two suddenly quieted down. The two who had made peace were now eating desserts together with much love. The scene suddenly became so harmonious, but I still had to ask Milim what she came for.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2684"><span class="indent"><span>“By the way, Milim, why did you come here anyway?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2685"><span class="indent"><span>“Fufu, didn’t I just say? I feel as though you guys are doing something interesting.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2686"><span class="indent"><span>“No no no, eh, is that really the only reason?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2687"><span class="indent"><span>“Yep. But, I’m so lucky to have come. This thing called cake is the best, and this labyrinth thing also looks quite interesting. I didn’t expect that Ramiris would have been so useful.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2688"><span class="indent"><span>“Fufu—! I’m just like everyone else who has kept my power a secret. It’s just that you didn’t manage to discover it!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2689"><span class="indent"><span>Even though you say that, you yourself didn’t discover it either, Ramiris—That’s just my thought, I should keep it to myself. By the way, this girl Milim was really keen to spot an idea of this size. There was really nothing that could be hidden from Milim. She was already someone who had ex-</span><span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> </span><span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and Frey as followers, and the speed at which she got here was truly shocking.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2690"><span class="indent"><span>Basically, Milim was a wild card. Normally speaking, how was it possible for someone to run around outside all by herself, but it was not that surprising if that someone was Milim. It was really nothing to be astounded by if she showed up here. I’ll need to keep this in mind.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2691"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2692"><span class="indent"><span>“Alright, now that we are done eating desserts, it’s about time to get back to work. Also Milim, if you won’t interfere, you can stay and play.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2693"><span class="indent"><span>How rare, Veldora-san had given a mature response. Now that I thought about it carefully, it would be a problem if these two (Veldora and Milim) started arguing. Because her opponent was Ramiris, Milim held herself back. But it might not have been the case if it was Veldora.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2694"><span class="indent"><span>The labyrinth facilities we put so much effort in to set up would be affected by their brawl and probably be destroyed instantly. It seemed that Milim didn’t hold a grudge against Veldora, so we’re safe for now.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2695"><span class="indent"><span>“Since mentor has said so, I don’t object either.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2696"><span class="indent"><span>It seemed that Ramiris had also agreed. Speaking of this, Milim was surprisingly on good terms with Ramiris, she was just intentionally playing tricks on her from the start.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2697"><span class="indent"><span>“Just count on me! I won’t be a hindrance, so give me some work as well!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2698"><span class="indent"><span>Milim’s mood had improved and she appeared to be willing to join us. I personally didn't have an objection, I was going to agree without hesitation, but there was something on my mind. There was a point I needed to confirm first.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2699"><span class="indent"><span>“If that’s the case, can we have Milim join as well—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2700"><span class="indent"><span>“Hmm!

You are the one getting scolded anyway, so I’ll drop the matter. Let’s talk dragons, dragon! Just now you said something about capturing a dragon, right? Is that really possible?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2712"><span class="indent"><span>“Uh! So I will get scolded indeed? No, but… It can’t be helped.

Standing by and observing was part of the duty as an adult.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2714"><span class="indent"><span>After some internal struggle, Milim chose fun over work.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2715"><span class="indent"><span>“You mean the dragons. They can be captured. Should I go find some?” she answered without hesitation and seemed to have switched up her mood. While saying it as if she was going to catch some beetles, she proposed we go catch some dragons.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2716"><span class="indent"><span>That’s just what I needed right now.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2717"><span class="indent"><span>“Uh, can I ask for that favor from you?

Nowadays in regions with concentrated magicules, there seemed to be Lesser Dragons spawning and dragons who inherited more elements of Spirit Dragon became Greater Dragons (Arch Dragons).</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2731"><span class="indent"><span>In addition, there were also more powerful dragons among the Arch Dragons, they were the dragon lords that represented the four elements. After living hundreds of years after evolving to an Arch Dragon, and then having their wisdom increased even farther—these were the dragon lords. After evolving, they seemed able to utilize part of Spirit Dragon’s power and no longer aged as they grew older. They were nearly a semi-spiritual-life-form. But unlike True Dragons, once they were eliminated, they were dead for good.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2732"><span class="indent"><span>I recalled that the sky dragon I beat was an Arch Dragon, its threat level was at Rank Calamity. Dragon lords are stronger than that, they could probably rival a </span><span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. In other words, perhaps they could compete with Clayman and Greater Spirits, or were perhaps even stronger than them.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2733"><span class="indent"><span>If they had that large of a magicule pool, they should be able to easily gain control over the terrain effects of each floor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2734"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2735"><span class="indent"><span>“Hold on, no matter how strong I am, I won’t be able to capture the mighty dragon lords!” Milim hurriedly exclaimed, afraid that I may have misunderstood.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2736"><span class="indent"><span>If she said so then it must be the case. It would be impossible to tame dragon lords who possessed intelligence. We might persuade them by asking for a favor, but the problem we were facing this time didn’t require us to go quite that far.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2737"><span class="indent"><span>“You have a point, then which ones are you catching?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2738"><span class="indent"><span>“Hmm! Although they cannot rival dragon lords, there are Arch Dragons who do possess elemental attributes. We will be catching and taming those guys and let them consume magicule and help change the terrain.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2739"><span class="indent"><span>I see. The dragons seemed to make their own nests, so they may modify their domain based on their needs.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2740"><span class="indent"><span>All the necessary components had been prepared, and the magicule was filled to the brim. So I’d take Milim’s suggestion.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2741"><span class="indent"><span>“Can I count on you?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2742"><span class="indent"><span>“Leave it to me! Some of the dragons with elemental attributes may soon evolve to dragon lords, so I’ll capture one for each element.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2743"><span class="indent"><span>According to Milim’s explanation, there were four elements that developed from the Spirit Dragon. For each element—the dragon lords of Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind were at the top of the food chain, followed by Elemental Dragons, forming a tree graph. There were four types of Elemental Dragons as well. They were the Fire Dragon, Ice Dragon, Wind Dragon, and Earth Dragon.</span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;The kanji names sound a lot cooler; they are Dragon of Flame (火炎竜), Dragon of Frost (冰雪竜), Dragon of hurtling Wind (烈風竜), Dragon of Shattering-Earth (地碎竜)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;The sky dragon I beat seemed to have been a subspecies that failed to evolve into a Wind Dragon. Unlike spirits, they didn’t have the element of “Air”.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2744"><span class="indent"><span>It was also said that there were mutated dragons and ones that received special evolution, in human’s words, they were called having (too much) personality.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2745"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2746"><span class="indent"><span>Anyhow, now we could expect levels with terrain effects. If Milim does catch the dragons, we should put them at lower levels. By the way, the Elemental Dragons were stronger than their non-elemental cousins. A rough estimation of their strength was around Special Rank A, a powerful species. Even though they couldn’t really compete with Charybdis, they were still very strong.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2747"><span class="indent"><span>I didn’t put too much thought in it. But in fact, a normal dragon could already rival six Holy Knights, or it was said to be able at least. But Elemental Dragons, even sending out a whole squad of Holy Knights might not necessarily be able to eliminate it… Still that’s none of my business.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2748"><span class="indent"><span>I’m not gonna care about that, but I’ve decided where to put my focus. The counters among the five main elements of spirits were as follows—Earth countered Air, Air countered Wind, Wind countered Water, Water countered Fire, Fire countered Earth. But the strength of Elemental Dragons didn’t seem to be affected by this countering effect.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2749"><span class="indent"><span>Although the elements countered each other, combat experience seemed to be far more important. In simpler terms, an older dragon surpassed a younger dragon. So I could put them wherever I wanted.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2750"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2751"><span class="indent"><span>Level 99 was the level of inferno flame.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2752"><span class="indent"><span>—The final level surrounded by scorching flames.

The width of the hallways inside the labyrinth area was also very large, so structurally it wouldn’t easily cause people to get lost.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2802"><span class="indent"><span>With that being said, four sides, each being 250 meters in length, was quite spacious. Investigating the hallways alone would be hard work and there wasn’t even much loot after walking all this time. This type of floor would likely lead to these situations. Having empty hallways alone probably wouldn’t attract any customers, but luckily there was a large number of weak </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> patrolling the area, so it shouldn't be an issue.

Anyhow, in this labyrinth, reality can be whatever I want!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2825"><span class="indent"><span>It was indeed the case as Ramiris put it. She could also change the ability given on each item, Ramiris’s skill was truly versatile. I once more lamented my inability to recreate her skill.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2826"><span class="indent"><span>Now the problem with the bosses was resolved as well.

There was no trap in the treasure chest. The only difference was that we would be moderating the drop rate of weapons and gear.

And following level 20, there would even be fake treasure chests.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2828"><span class="italic indent"><span>This was somewhat distasteful, predatory one might say, but I suppose you could call that giving a sense of clarity and a reminder during the exploration of the labyrinth.

The inside of the labyrinth was full of magicules, so the equipment might even become magic swords or magic spears after some time. Since they were getting such precious rewards, encountering danger should be expected. They wouldn’t die as long as they had a “</span><span data-term="Revival Bracelet" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>”, so it would be more exciting to be cruel, and reasonably speaking, more interesting.

Because, if we have that type of facility, ‘Return Whistle’ will not sell well.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2834"><span class="indent"><span>I suppose that’s right too. Ramiris’s comment was an on-point rebuttal. She did have a point. She was apparently quite perceptive when it came to money.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2835"><span class="indent"><span>“Indeed, putting this type of facility on a level with a save point does make it meaningless. Should we perhaps pick the middle ones, to make levels ending in five be safe zones?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2836"><span class="indent"><span>“Hmm hmm, that should work!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2837"><span class="indent"><span>We should make them available for storing items looted by adventurers and selling healing potions among other items at high prices. Building a meal area would be nice too.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2838"><span class="indent"><span>We didn’t have to put all these facilities on different floors, we just needed to make sure these floors all had access to the same location.

If that doesn’t work, we can just turn it into a standing area.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2900"><span class="indent"><span>We didn’t have enough time, so we’d save the work for the original standing area for later.

But I recalled that she mentioned something about the labyrinth being connected to all parts of the world…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3248"><span class="indent"><span>“Can I? Then we’ll have them move in tomorrow! With the power of my mentor, expansion of the labyrinth is super easy! I feel like my power has increased as well. There are still empty floors right now, so perhaps it’ll be a great idea to turn one of them into a forest!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3249"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris accepted my proposal with joy all over her face.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3250"><span class="indent"><span>“With the power of her mentor”—that line kind of concerned me, but whatever, that’ll do.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3251"><span class="indent"><span>“But we are residents of the Jura Great Forest, so shouldn’t we follow </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-sama…?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3252"><span class="indent"><span>Although, I still had some reservations about it. Even </span><span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san seemed to be concerned, though her facial expression said otherwise. I could tell that she wanted to live with her sisters as well.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3253"><span class="indent"><span>As I stated several times: I personally didn’t object. In fact, the interior of the labyrinth was the domain of Ramiris. The region managed by me and the residence of Ramiris coexisted at the same time. This was the so-called special zone. It was why the area run by Ramiris inside the labyrinth could enjoy extraterritorial judiciary.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3254"><span class="indent"><span>I explained the matter to them and told them that I wouldn’t hold them accountable for anything if they migrated now, since Ramiris’s subordinates were immortal inside the labyrinth. Moreover, I thought it best for them to serve their original master, so I suggested.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3255"><span class="indent"><span>“We treants and dryads hope to move here and seek the protection of Ramiris-sama.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3256"><span class="indent"><span>“We know that this is sudden, but will you grant us your permission?” </span><span data-term="Trya" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and Doris requested. And without a doubt, I granted permission.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3257"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3258"><span class="indent"><span>And just like that, the plan to move the treant tribe into Ramiris’ labyrinth had been approved. They’d live on floor 95, which was currently serving as the shelter for the </span><span data-term="beastmen" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. This dome-shaped floor was the largest of its kind, with a diameter spanning five kilometers, offering plenty of space. Another reason was that I was planning to make that level a resting zone anyway, and this just happened to help make things smoother. After all, we already had the so-called forest hot spring, so the resting area couldn’t be too shabby either.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3259"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3260"><span class="indent"><span>The issue concerning their migration was settled quickly. Ramiris went to where the treants lived and created a new labyrinth gate to directly move the entire tribe inside. Since the treants traveled exceedingly slowly, she opened up a gate in front of every individual treant in order to speed things along.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3261"><span class="indent"><span>And with that, Ramiris got a bunch of new subordinates. They even helped to stabilize the interior of the labyrinth as well. Managing the magicule concentration and the air conditioning had also become easier… Not only that, but the treants seemed to also be content with their living conditions. The increased magicule concentration had made everyone livelier.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3262"><span class="indent"><span>As for the </span><span data-term="beastmen" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> who were temporarily residing there, they didn’t seem to care much about it either. The treants were all very well-behaved people, spending most of their time sleeping. In addition, they looked no different from normal trees, so it was no wonder why no one minded. The </span><span data-term="beastmen" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> would have to return to </span><span data-term="Yuurazania" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> someday, so sharing their residence wouldn’t really bother them. With a more comfortable living environment, chances were high that they’d actually come to welcome the treants instead.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3263"><span class="indent"><span>The dryads also agreed to work on managing the labyrinth. Well, I should say that they were more like volunteers instead of workers.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3264"><span class="indent"><span>“We after all have the honor to build an amusement park here, so it is an easy task.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3265"><span class="indent"><span>Since </span><span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san put it that way, her sisters, and the rest of the dryads had no objections. Now we got some unexpected assistance.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3266"><span class="indent"><span>………</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3267"><span class="indent"><span>……</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3268"><span class="indent"><span>…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3269"><span class="indent"><span>And so, a small forest had been added inside the labyrinth.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3270"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3271"><span class="indent"><span>Level 95 ended in a five, making it a safe zone. Plus, we still had some empty floors left, so we turned levels 91 to 94 into warehouses, flower beds, or processing factories. To be more specific, level 91 would be a warehouse for iron ore, level 92 the manufacturing factory that refined the ore to magisteel, level 93 the flower beds, and level 94 would be the honey processing plant.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3272"><span class="indent"><span>Anyone from level 95 could directly reach these floors with ease due to convenient transportation. There was a save point in the center, adjacent to it were gates that lead to different floors as well as stairs to go to lower levels. It was thanks to the fact that the labyrinth completely negated the laws of physics that we got such a convenient structure.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3273"><span class="indent"><span>As soon as someone defeated the boss at level 90, the stairs to level 95 would immediately appear. We all agreed that there was no harm in letting the people that had made it to that point take a little shortcut if they so desired.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3274"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3275"><span class="indent"><span>After which—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3276"><span class="indent"><span>From floor 96 onwards was a grueling series of the most challenging, hellish levels. Before attempting them, adventurers needed to take a rest and inspect their equipment. We didn’t forget to set up gates and caution signs before the stairs leading to the lower levels. We also opened inns, as well as weapon and gear stores surrounding the gate. The inns had gates leading to all the safe zones. That made it very convenient in times like these.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3277"><span class="indent"><span>Now let’s check out the stores selling weapons and gear. During their opening hours, the shops would only display the rare equipment exclusive to the labyrinth. I didn’t think we’d have too many customers, so they’d most likely become stores for the blacksmithing enthusiasts.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3278"><span class="italic indent"><span>Should I sneak one of my own works onto the shelf as well?</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;While daydreaming about this, I decided to discuss the plan with </span><span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.

With their relationship being this tense, I was honestly worried about them kicking off a brawl any moment. They attempted to pull each other back as they moved in front of me.

The two races had been fighting each other for over a hundred years, and it was said that the biggest victim of it were the elves.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3467"><span class="indent"><span>The elder stated—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3468"><span class="indent"><span>The elves relied on the resources of the forest to survive, to them the expansion of the warzone was an issue that concerned their livelihood. In order to prevent themselves from being harmed by external threats, the elves applied a disorienting ‘Barrier’ around their hidden residence. However, the war had damaged the forest—as the trees were chopped down the ‘Barrier’ was destroyed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3469"><span class="indent"><span>Without vegetation, trying to disorientate invaders was futile, which left their hidden residence completely exposed to the outside world.

Edible vegetables and fruits couldn’t be grown, and there were elves that ran off to seek jobs in the Dwarven Kingdom. Now that I thought about it, the elven ladies at Night Butterfly must have left their home for that reason to make a living working in foreign lands.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3471"><span class="indent"><span>Later, due to the increased severity of the outflowing population, their residence became hard to maintain.

These were the elder’s claims.

There were more of their race in ancient times, and back then they apparently also built a kingdom that prospered for a while.

In other words, Frey had not given up on the divine tree. It was then that Frey took interest in the tengu tribe.

Compared to that, Milim was the bigger problem.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3734"><span class="indent"><span>After which, Momiji absorbed the entirety of our conversation. The dichotomy between her imagination and the reality was so large to have caused her to become speechless, not knowing how to react. I guess that should be the case. That’s just how the reality really is. They were just keeping up their guard against a certain enemy that might cause crisis to their race, but it turned out she had switched her focus long ago. Learning this today would definitely prompt people to try and escape reality.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3735"><span class="indent"><span>“—I understand the whole thing now.

It is enough for me to have been able to resolve your misunderstanding.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3736"><span class="indent"><span>It was likely because the tengu had kept away from the world and were less informed on current affairs.

Their argument was that if we couldn’t prove that the construction would be absolutely safe, they wouldn’t allow us to work. I found it reasonable and easily agreed, so there weren’t any problems with that. We still needed to talk with the executives from </span><span data-term="Sarion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> regarding us building a tunnel, but we would plan for that after the train development had concluded. There was no immediate need to make a decision at this point in time. The tengu tribe hoped that we would not interfere with them, but they only said so fearing that we might rally and invade them.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3744"><span class="indent"><span>Now that our misunderstanding had been resolved, there was no reason why we shouldn’t communicate.

Hmm, how cute indeed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3986"><span class="indent"><span>Since this small fox willingly accepted the job, I’d just hand it over to it. If it didn’t meet our expectations, we would just have to get rid of the forest.

It seems I got careless. Moreover, after being named, Kumara grew almost instantaneously, and the number of its tails increased from four all the way up to nine.
