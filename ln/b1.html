<p class="no-indent" id="line_18">I, Shizue Izawa, am an otherworlder summoned into this world.</p>
<p id="line_19">The person who summoned me is one of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, the apex of this world, named Leon Cromwell. However, my being summoned is apparently not what he is seeking after. Even with the unimaginable power he has, it is very difficult to achieve what he is looking for. That is how harsh this world is. And I will come to be all too familiar with this fact.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklet 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_20">It’s early morning. My day started with harsh training. Just now, my sword got deflected and I was struck hard. As I fell to the ground, I was subjected to fierce scolding.</p>
<p id="line_21">“Mind your shield! Your sword should always be at the ready!”</p>
<p id="line_22">It was from the Black Knight Claude, famed as the strongest among the subordinates of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. He is my teacher.</p>
<p id="line_23">After <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon made me possess Ifrit, I came to be treated as a high-ranking <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I became able to manipulate fire at will, and as a result, I began a life of disposing of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> forces that antagonize <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon seems not to be satisfied, as he has ordered his trusted confidant Claude-san to make me master martial arts. At first, I received guidance in a group, together with many people, adults and children alike. But before long, I was given special treatment and switched to one-on-one coaching.</p>
<p id="line_24">Training is hard. I am equipped with a wooden sword and shield that were made to weigh the same as the real ones. They were never adjusted to fit a child like me. They are so heavy that merely lifting them is arduous work. In addition, I am made to wear a padded undershirt containing sand, instead of armor, and when I fall down, getting back up is difficult enough. And even when I am struggling with that, my master, Claude-san, didn’t show a hint of compassion.</p>
<p id="line_25">“What are you doing? On your feet, now!”</p>
<p id="line_26">He scolded me again, this time with a kick. After sensing it, I avoided it feverishly. I thought I couldn’t move anymore, and yet my body reacted. This is all thanks to my ‘Unity’ with Ifrit. Before I knew it, I obtained power that made me a high-ranking <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. But even that power can’t beat Claude-san. After all, his status as the strongest subordinate of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon is not just for show; he is not just some child who somehow became a high-ranking <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> recently.</p>
<p id="line_27">“You’re slow,” he said, slamming his wooden sword against my shield. The shock sent a searing pain through my arm holding it. It hurt so bad, I think I might have broken a bone. Sadly, I came to learn to grasp the condition of my body from the intensity of the pain. In other words, I injured myself every single day, and that is not something to be praised for. At this rate, I’ll end up crippled from my training before I master martial arts.</p>
<p id="line_28">It isn’t like Claude-san cared about that, though.</p>
<p id="line_29">“Hold up your shield, or do you want your skull cracked open?”</p>
<p id="line_30">He scolded me heartlessly, while my eyes were watering from the pain. To be honest, I think Claude-san is an oni. I think he is being immature towards an eight-year old me. But, for Claude-san, he is still showing his utmost kindness in his own way, by making sure I don’t die.</p>
<p id="line_31">The cold healing medicine dripping down from my head is comforting.</p>
<p id="line_32"><em>Oh, I see.</em></p>
<p id="line_33">It looks like I was unable to avoid the blow to my head. I probably owe my life to the disaster hood I was wearing in place of a helmet.</p>
<p id="line_34">“A-are you okay?”</p>
<p id="line_35">I can hear Claude-san’s voice, in a panic somewhere. He was really strict during training, but that voice is very kind. Needless to say, even Claude-san would be punished if he were to kill an associate of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. But that wasn’t the reason he was anxious; judging from the sound of his voice, I can feel that he’s genuinely concerned for me.</p>
<p id="line_36">That’s what gives me the strength to do my best.</p>
<p id="line_37">“I am fine.”</p>
<p id="line_38">“I-is that so? All right!”</p>
<p id="line_39">He breathed a sigh of relief. That soon faded away, and his usual stern gaze hit me.</p>
<p id="line_40">“That’s all the medicine for today. Don’t neglect your exercise so that you can react better tomorrow. Do longer training runs to build up the foundation of your physical strength!”</p>
<p id="line_41">“Yes, master.”</p>
<p id="line_42">Hearing my reply, Claude-san nodded with a “hmm.” That marked the end of today’s combat training. Then I started running as I was told, with the wooden sword and shield, while wearing the sand-padded undergarment. Normally, I wouldn’t be able to even take one step. But I can move now somehow. I unfortunately ended up being able to. I’m a little unhappy with the fact that it feels like I’ve stopped being a human, but it’s too late to regret that.</p>
<p id="line_43">After all, there was a new <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> attack something like once a week, and the role of Ifrit, who has assimilated with me, is to repel them all. I can’t make choices during battles, but I’m conscious, which makes me remember what I did. That’s why I fully understand I have to be strong. Age doesn’t matter in this world. If I want to survive, I have to figure out what I can do. On top of that, all I should do is to improve myself little by little. Knowing this, I kept running until noon, until I could hardly move.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklet 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_44">From noon till evening, I stand by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon’s side. He seldom talks to me now that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s’ attacks have gotten more frequent. He spends most of his day in his office. I’m not really sure myself, but apparently he has a lot of paperwork he has to deal with. When I heard that he works while I’m practicing, it gave me the impression that he’s a workaholic. I didn’t tell anyone, but I was surprised when I heard it because I thought that his job was to act all self-important and lord it over people.</p>
<p id="line_45">I stay in the throne room for about two hours during the day. Quite a few people come to see him every day. I don’t speak a word and just listen to the conversations. What I learned from them is that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon is unexpectedly adored. About 90 percent of the visits were to report on how things were going and words of gratitude.</p>
<p id="line_46">This place is a hidden village in the Great Jura Forest, and even the castle was erected to be hidden behind the rocky mountains. Furthermore, it seems to have been magically concealed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon’s power, hiding it from public view. Despite that, it still gets attacked repeatedly, the reason being that this land was taken from another <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And no matter how much you try to conceal something, it’s moot when others already know where it is.</p>
<p id="line_47">Also the people who live in such a place are, to my surprise, like the slaves of the Eastern Empire and Western Countries. I heard that children of mixed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> blood are not strong enough to survive in an area inhabited by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and that they are subject to discrimination in human habitations. There is no place for them to live, and so some rather choose to be slaves. Others were forced to live for different reasons, including those who fell into slavery because they didn’t pay their taxes, those who were hunted down by bandits and sold off, and those who fled after being defeated in tribal wars. Some were even sold by their parents out of poverty. Now they all admire <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon.</p>
<p id="line_48">As for my case, I know the miseries of war. I realized that my mother was going through a lot of hardship because food rations were tight. Still, that was better than what the people I saw here have experienced. So I can understand their reverence for the person who has saved them.</p>
<p id="line_49">But that makes me more puzzled. Why is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon helping people in secret?</p>
<p id="line_50">“Hm, pitiful people. All it takes is a little mercy to fill their hearts with loyalty to me.”</p>
<p id="line_51">Perhaps <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon noticed my gaze as he said those words with a sneer. That’s the attitude I expected from a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I was almost fooled. As I thought, he’s a bad guy. I didn’t say it out loud, but I vowed to myself that I would never be deceived about that again.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_52">One day, through a casual conversation with Claude-san during my training, I asked where the people who gathered had gone.</p>
<p id="line_53">“His Majesty Leon has sent all the people that gathered to work to his country, which is a safe place for them to live. However, only those who are deemed worthy to be his own people after their aptitude is judged here will be sent there.”</p>
<p id="line_54">Apparently, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon rules a vast territory apart from this land. Claude-san said that the purpose of this place was to select suitable people to live there.</p>
<p id="line_55">“But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> attack here every day, and bad <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s have their eyes on Leon-sama. If his country is safe, isn’t it better for Leon-sama to move there?”</p>
<p id="line_56">Ignoring something complicated such as selecting people, I thought it would be better for a king to be in a safe place. My job is to guard <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. It would be easier to protect him if he stayed in a safe place, meaning my job would be way easier…</p>
<p id="line_57">“Hahaha, you’re pretty smart, Shizu. But he can’t do that. Drawing the enemy’s attention is a core reason for remaining here.”</p>
<p id="line_58">“Enemy? Are we trying to stand out, while also staying hidden?”</p>
<p id="line_59">What does that mean? We are supposed to be living here in secret, so how does that make sense when our purpose is to attract attention?</p>
<p id="line_60">“Hm, there are several reasons, but the problem is that the kingdom is under construction. It will be an impregnable city once the construction is complete, but as of now, it’s still dangerous. By keeping the enemy’s eyes on us <em>here</em>, we can keep the work <em>there</em> uninterrupted. Then again, the future site borders on the territory of another wickedly dangerous guy. Fortunately, there haven’t been any hostilities; we’re just keeping an eye out for now. Whom we should be more cautious about is a man named Clayman, who is actively hostile towards us.”</p>
<p id="line_61">Clayman is also a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I was surprised when I learned that there is more than one <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and to hear that we have our eyes on such a terrifying person frightens me.</p>
<p id="line_62">“Can I defeat him?”</p>
<p id="line_63">“That’s got to be impossible. Not yet. Ifrit is a powerful spirit, and now that you became a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you’ll become even stronger. But still, you can’t win against a disaster-class.”</p>
<p id="line_64">“That’s…”</p>
<p id="line_65">“That’s why, Shizu. Be stronger. Train harder to protect His Majesty Leon. Be stronger until no one can defeat you!” Claude-san encouraged me, and I agreed with a “yeah!”</p>
<p id="line_66">I don’t quite get the logic about becoming stronger to protect <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon, who is much stronger than me, but I don’t need any reason to become strong. This is not the world where I was scared of air-raids and lost my mother. You can become stronger the harder you try in this world, and in order for me to live through I will become strong. Now, I’m still just completely relying on Ifrit’s power, but still, I will be able to master its power someday and protect the people within my reach.</p>
<p id="line_67">“By that time, I will also protect Master Claude!”</p>
<p id="line_68">“Hahaha, you cheeky child. If that’s the case, I shall not hold back with your training!”</p>
<p id="line_69">With that, I had to spend more intense days of training.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklet 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_70">The contents of my training were not only related to martial arts, but also a wide range of other things.</p>
<p id="line_71">“Shall we learn about manners today?”</p>
<p id="line_72">The one who said that was the one standing at my back and is one of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon’s confidants, Silver Knight Alrose-sama. He usually supervises the construction of the country on behalf of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. He’s a very busy individual, but he still manages to regularly come to the base in the Great Jura Forest to report. It appears that he was appointed to teach me table manners tonight.</p>
<p id="line_73">“Um, meals are usually Master Claude’s…”</p>
<p id="line_74">“He’s no good. Sure, that man is skillful, but he’s unrefined. I’ve been told he has almost killed you countless times.”</p>
<p id="line_75">“T-that, that’s because of my carelessness—”</p>
<p id="line_76">“You fool. It’s ridiculous to be serious about killing a child who is not even ten years old,” Alrose-sama said bitterly, criticizing Claude-san. I don’t agree with what he said, but the food was brought to the table faster than I could make a retort.</p>
<p id="line_77">“First is the hors d’oeuvre. Eat it using the outermost fork and knife,” he said, as the woman who was sitting in front of me demonstrated it.</p>
<p id="line_78">Use your knife to pull the salad into your fork then to your mouth in a graceful manner. Make sure to carefully adjust the size with the knife to make the salad bite-sized. That’s what he explained to me, but I had no time to follow all that.</p>
<p id="line_79">Alrose-sama patiently supervised my movements. That’s why I tried looking at the woman’s demonstration and desperately imitated her.</p>
<p id="line_80">“Hm. You used to use a utensil called chopsticks in your hometown. I looked it up, and apparently there are some parts in this world that also use such a utensil. There was no custom of using forks and knives in those areas, so I thought it would be difficult for you to use them, but…you’re surprisingly skillful at this.”</p>
<p id="line_81">Did he praise me? If so, that makes me glad. When I came to this world, there was one thing that made me happy. It was that meals were served to me every day. If you train hard, you get hungry. I was worried about what to do if I didn’t have enough food, but that turned out to be a non-issue. I was told that it was a crude menu, but compared to the ration yam I received in my previous world, it was nothing short of a feast. They gave me vegetable soup and bread, hearty stew, and sometimes meat.</p>
<p id="line_82">At first, I was perplexed by these unfamiliar dishes, but once I tried them, they were so delicious that I quickly adapted to the food here. I learned how to eat their food through observation and imitation. Because it would be a waste if I spilled or left too much food. That’s why I learned proper eating manners, or so I thought…</p>
<p id="line_83">“However, it’s still far from elegant. Good thing I’m doing something about it early. At this rate, you might grow a bad habit.”</p>
<p id="line_84">To Alrose-sama, my gestures were totally no good. Then, he reprimanded me at the next soup.</p>
<p id="line_85">“Don’t slurp it. And most especially, don’t make a noise!” he scolded me with a slap on my shoulder.</p>
<p id="line_86">I noticed he was carrying a short stick, but I didn’t expect it was for this use. It was not unbearable, but I cried a little from the shock of being hit, not like Alrose-sama cared though.</p>
<p id="line_87">“Again.”</p>
<p id="line_88">Then I did it again about five times, and finally passed. Though, just barely.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_89">Then the next harsh lesson started. Delicious dishes that I had never seen appeared one after another. In spite of that, I was so desperate to learn manners that I had no time to taste the food. When it was over, I got exhausted, and Alrose-sama didn’t waste a second to reprimand me.</p>
<p id="line_90">“Straighten up! Don’t forget that the most important thing while eating is your posture.”</p>
<p id="line_91">That’s why they even prepared a special chair for me. Alrose-sama is right, after all.</p>
<p id="line_92">“Anyway, I didn’t expect you to remember everything today. I’ll give you this opportunity once a week, so you will study with her from now on. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask her.”</p>
<p id="line_93">Alrose-sama introduced the woman who demonstrated for him. I wasn’t able to ask for her name during the lecture, but to my surprise, she was a colleague of both Alrose-sama and Claude-san. Her name was Maetel, the White Knight, one of the confidants of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. I heard she specializes in recovery magic.</p>
<p id="line_94">“There must be some things you can’t discuss with men, right? Don’t hesitate to ask me anything,” Maetel-san said with a smile. She seems very nice. She reminds me of my mother a little. Not wanting to get sentimental, I smiled back at Maetel-san.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_95">Maetel-san said that manners don’t have to be so formal. Since I’m a bodyguard of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon, I might need to join banquets. She said that’s the reason why Alrose-sama is trying to make me able to handle such a situation.</p>
<p id="line_96">“Even if there were, they would only be with merchants, so I don’t think you have to use such formal manners as dealing with aristocrats. Well, you lose nothing by learning them, so good luck.”</p>
<p id="line_97">I was relieved to hear that. And one more thing.</p>
<p id="line_98">“You can eat delicious food, no? It’s Shizu-chan’s reward for doing her best.”</p>
<p id="line_99">But it would be better if she’d let me eat them more freely.</p>
<p id="line_100">“Tee-hee, of course, I can’t do that. I can’t just show partiality to you for no reason. So, if you want to taste delicious food, learn the etiquette and become a lady soon.”</p>
<p id="line_101">I’m quite disappointed to hear that, but at the same time, I also want to become a wonderful woman like Maetel-san. I shall do my best and be approved soon.</p>
<p id="line_102">I made up my mind and secretly kindled the flame of my motivation.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklet 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_103">The combat training is still handled by Master Claude. And Maetel-san taught me various other affairs. She told me that there are nine other <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s in this world aside from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. And there are also four beings more dangerous than them—the True Dragons. Rather than teaching me general knowledge, she proceeded with educating me about such dangerous beings.</p>
<p id="line_104">“There wouldn’t be a problem if you embarrassed yourself in the town or castle, as you could just reflect and learn from it. But if you failed in dealing with an entity of disaster like a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it would be over at that point. There would be no next time, so you wouldn’t be able to reflect on it. That’s why, it might be too early for you, but I want you to learn these important matters,” Maetel-san said.</p>
<p id="line_105">As a bodyguard to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon, I might meet such individuals. So she helped me to be more cautious so as to not cause trouble when that happened.</p>
<p id="line_106">True Dragons are immortal creatures. Currently, there are only three confirmed to be active, as the other one is still awaiting its resurrection. And one of those three is sealed somewhere here in the Great Jura Forest. Some entity called a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was responsible for that.

The latter is supposedly a descendant of a hero, but whether he is a hero himself or not is unclear. There’s also a famous elven hero who fought against an evil dragon, but it’s unknown whether she’s alive.</p>
<p id="line_108">“They say the one who sealed the True Dragon—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Storm Dragon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Veldora—was the masked hero.

<p id="line_109">“…Huh?” I sputtered, bewildered</p>
<p id="line_110">Maetel-san just chuckled. Her attitude tells me that she has no intention of letting me in on everything that easily. Convinced of this, I vowed to myself to put in more effort.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_111">Incidentally, though very unexpected, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon also cautioned me. The progress of my education was put to test in his spare time during an audience with him. During that, he told me that there are also very troublesome beings. It was not I who answered the question, but my instructor, Claude-san. That said, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon was not convinced.</p>
<p id="line_112">“Her odds? Claude, you would’ve been right had you been training your average warrior. But Shizu is different. If you leave everything to Ifrit, your strength will immediately reach its peak. As proof, you did nothing at all in the battles against the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, Shizu.”</p>
<p id="line_113">“But Shizu is still a child. It’s only natural she couldn’t do anything.”</p>
<p id="line_114"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon snorted and ignored Claude-san. He then turned and glared at me with piercing eyes.</p>
<p id="line_115">“Shizu, are you fine with completely relying on Ifrit?”</p>
<p id="line_116">There’s no way I am. The reason I’m training hard is to reduce the number of unhappy people. In order for me to survive and to protect those I can protect with these hands, I need to be strong. In order to do this, I should not let Ifrit alone do all the fighting.</p>
<p id="line_117">“No.”</p>
<p id="line_118">That’s why I answered honestly.</p>
<p id="line_119">“That’s good to hear. Don’t be a burden; be a useful tool. In order to do so, you must be able to make the most of the ‘unity’ with Ifrit and master using its power. If you semi-materialize your body, physical attacks won’t work, even without a shield. And that sword—”</p>
<p id="line_120">With a glance at the heavily modified wooden sword, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon knitted his brows.</p>
<p id="line_121">“…It’s pointless. Shizu would be better off lashing her enemies with speed, rather than relying on brute strength. Speed is the most important factor in battle. If you don’t train for it, instead becoming a turtle; only death will await you should your shell ever crack.”</p>
<p id="line_122">These are harsh words, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon is right. However, Claude-san didn’t seem convinced.</p>
<p id="line_123">“With all due respect, Leon-sama, are you intending to change Shizu’s weapon into a rapier? After all, if you do such a thing, Shizu’s means of defense will decrease. It is next to impossible to block the enemy’s sword with a rapier.”</p>
<p id="line_124">“I can,” he stated.</p>
<p id="line_125">“Shizu is not like you, Leon-sama,” Clause insisted. “First of all—”</p>
<p id="line_126">“She can.”</p>
<p id="line_127">That declaration was equivalent to an order.</p>
<p id="line_128">“Understood. In that case, I shall reconsider Shizu-san’s training,” Claude-san conceded.</p>
<p id="line_129">“All right.”</p>
<p id="line_130">Probably feeling satisfied, he was about to leave, but then stopped halfway and looked back at me.</p>
<p id="line_131">“Shizu, I’ll give you a piece of advice. Talk more with Ifrit. Reach a mutual understanding with it and take its power for yourself. If you don’t, you’ll be consumed by it.”</p>
<p id="line_132">That made me wonder. Because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon wanted Ifrit to possess a new body… By new body, he means me…</p>
<p id="line_133">“Leon-sama, didn’t you want me to be a body for Ifrit?” I asked him without thinking, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon clicked his tongue. He looked pretty upset, but he was still willing to answer.</p>
<p id="line_134">“Spirits are lifeforms of no free will. As they approach becoming a greater spirit, they develop a sense of self. But they have no emotions. They cannot distinguish right from wrong, and will only do what their master ordered them to do, just like a machine. That’s why, I want you to guide it to new heights by having it learn from your conversations.”</p>
<p id="line_135">I asked him the question while thinking he might get mad at me, but surprisingly, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon gave a serious explanation. I’ve never had such a long conversation with him. And his explanation was very convincing because it was about Ifrit’s development. Evidently, Ifrit does not know swordsmanship. It makes sense that I can be stronger by supplementing that part.</p>
<p id="line_136">“I suppose you will never meet <em>her</em>, but she is there in <em>that</em> land—one of the rulers of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> named Jaune, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yellow Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

He’s a real piece of work and—”</p>
<p id="line_137"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon’s explanation was short, but the gist of it was clear. In short, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s are very dangerous. I don’t think I’ll ever meet them, but I kept in mind to be careful.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_138">I learned quite a bit through this. Unfortunately, there was nothing that I would have learnt from school ever thought to me. After all, they told me I wouldn’t be needing to write anything and so I didn’t have to study it.</p>
<p id="line_139">“Aren’t you going to teach me to learn the language, math, or history?”</p>
<p id="line_140">I thought those things are essential things to learn at school, so I tried to ask the question. Maetel-san was perplexed, but answered smiling: “Our country is new. So, there’s not enough history to teach. Besides, most of our people are illiterate, so the establishment of educational institutions is a future task. That’s why it would be inefficient to teach only you.”</p>
<p id="line_141">Luckily, a common language is used in the Sorcerer’s Dynasty, which is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon’s main business partner, and the human lands, such as the Western Nations and the Eastern Empire. There are many different countries, yet there’s only one language. I was surprised to hear that, but she followed up with something even more surprising.</p>
<p id="line_142">“First of all, Shizu-chan, you and I are speaking different languages. Haven’t you noticed?”</p>
<p id="line_143">“Eh?”</p>
<p id="line_144">“Hee-hee. As expected, you haven’t. Speech conveying a person’s will can be analyzed with magic. That’s the reason why you can’t talk to other adults.”</p>
<p id="line_145">Now that she mentioned it, maybe that’s indeed the case. I thought I was certainly being hated because I was an outsider, but I guess I was mistaken.</p>
<p id="line_146">“Good grief, shame to Claude-dono. He did not teach you the most important thing. Even if it’s too early for you to learn magic, ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ is a foundation of battle.”</p>
<p id="line_147">After that conversation, Claude-san and Maetel-san had an argument, and in the end, it was decided that Claude-san would teach me ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’</p>
<p id="line_148">“Yeah, sorry about that,” Claude-san apologized. “If you learned this first, you’d lose the ability to sense killing intents and presence, so I thought I should put off teaching you ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ I totally forgot that you couldn’t talk to anyone but us.”</p>
<p id="line_149">At the sight of me gravely shaking my head, he laughed. Then he gently stroked my head.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_150">The next day, ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ was added to my class, and it took me about 2 weeks to get it. Then, indeed, I was able to communicate with people I had not been able to communicate with before. I even made friends. This is how I got used to life in this world.</p>

Fighting is scary, but everything will soon be over if I just leave it to Ifrit. Training is harder for me. The days of being badly beaten by Claude-san continue.</p>
<p id="line_152">One day, something unusual happened. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon appeared during my training.</p>
<p id="line_153">“Claude, this fighting style…doesn’t fit Shizu.”</p>
<p id="line_154">That’s the first thing he said. He glared at me with a sullen expression on his face. I hid behind Claude-san in fear, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon had no time for my antics.</p>
<p id="line_155">“Shizu, show yourself.”</p>
<p id="line_156">I cannot disobey his order. Having no choice, I stepped forward and stood facing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon.</p>
<p id="line_157">“This get-up is also a problem. Why are you carrying a shield?”</p>
<p id="line_158">“Leon-sama, if we let Shizu get used to a heavy shield, her defense will become as hard as an iron wall. With Ifrit, she can increase her odds in battle.”</p>
<p id="line_159">“I understand. I will strive to get closer to Ifrit-san,” I added.</p>
<p id="line_160">But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon still had a troubled look on his face. The wrinkle between his eyebrows seems to be getting deeper… I want to think I’m only imagining it.</p>
<p id="line_161">“Strive.”</p>
<p id="line_162">In the end, Demo Lord Leon left without saying anything more.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Booklet 1/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_163">Several years came and went. Maybe because I was recognized as an executive, I was allowed to move about freely, to some extent. My symbiotic relationship with Ifrit is going well, and my free time has increased. Perhaps it was this sense of relief that caught me off guard and led to the tragedy.</p>
<p id="line_164">I have killed Pirino, my friend, with my own hands. The reason was that Ifrit went out of control, but that was because I failed to control it. That day I lost something important to me as a human.</p>
<p id="line_165">‘As I thought, it was too early to allow her to go free.’</p>
<p id="line_166">‘I’m sorry. I got careless because Shizu was excellent.’</p>
<p id="line_167">‘But now that it has come to this—it’s impossible for her to live with us…’</p>
<p id="line_168">‘Hm, I have no need for unusable tools. It won’t be long before we leave this base. Let’s leave Shizu behind then.’</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_169">It feels like the conversation took place in a misty distant place. It seems to have been a long discussion, but the last words strangely remained in my mind. It was the words <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon seems to have uttered—<em>I have no need for unusable tools.</em> Only those words echoed repeatedly in my mind until I lost consciousness.</p>
<p id="line_170">And then, it was when I was left alone in the abandoned castle, waiting for an enemy that may come, that I regained consciousness. I don’t know what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon really intended when he told me to stay. There is no point in my staying here because they fled without fighting the enemy. But the fact that I was left behind here means that they’ve abandoned me.</p>
<p id="line_171">It seems that’s the case, but I don’t want to believe it. Master Claude, Maetel-san, and even Alrose-sama were all kind to me. I also made some friends…those that worked in the castle—but Pirino is already gone. Right. She was killed by Ifrit—my own hands. That’s why there’s no way we can reach a mutual understanding anymore. If the spirit can learn and grow through its mutual influence with the host, then my relationship with Ifrit is the worst. That’s why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon abandoned me. Broken tools are of no value to him… That’s the only reason I could think of as to why he abandoned me. For some reason, I remembered the eyes of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. Those cold, unfeeling eyes. That person, who hates useless things… Did he really abandon me for that reason? What if he had something else in mind?</p>
<p id="line_172">Maybe I’m just trying to find excuses because I can’t move on. My desire to have that warmth again does not allow me to accept reality. And now it’s gone and never to be obtained again. Still, I keep my unfulfilled wish in my heart.</p>
<p id="line_173"><em>Chk chk chk…</em></p>
