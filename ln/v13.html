The Communicator was a magical telepathic communication machine that Vesta successfully developed. The crazy part about this device was its ability to send both audio </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>and</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;visual information.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_174"><span class="indent"><span>The Communicator looked exactly like a computer. It had a monitor, a mouse, and a keyboard—the mouse was more of a palm-sized crystal ball—and could be activated by simply touching it. After that, if you pressed the other party engraved on the keyboard, you could connect with them. It had a simple design that focused on being user-friendly. That said, there was a drawback.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_175"><span class="indent"><span>The visual information were actually “thoughts” being regenerated in the brain. Consequently, whatever you were thinking—as long as you held and activated the Communicator—would be leaked directly to the other party. It worked on the same principle as ‘Telepathy Net’. Since I was accustomed to this form of communication, I could just shut down any idle thoughts I had, but if someone unfamiliar tried to use it, they might give out unnecessary information.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_176"><span class="indent"><span>There was also the potential danger of leaking any malicious thoughts you had to the other party. You shouldn’t think of any ulterior motives. In my opinion, I wouldn’t recommend using this device to make advances on women. It would be safer for normal people who hadn’t undergone mental training to only use the call function. Anyway, let’s just eagerly wait for this machine’s improvement in the future.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_177"><span class="indent"><span>‹Hello, this is </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> speaking.

They would soon be within the effective range of their magic guns. Although its maximum range was 30 kilometers, accuracy suffered with that distance. The guns could technically reach that far, but the actual effective range was three kilometers. However, if you used a special exploding shell, you wouldn’t have to worry about the lack of accuracy. There were only a few enemies, and they were advancing while packed together in a narrow area. They probably thought they could use the trees as shields if they didn’t go out in the open…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_445"><span class="italic indent"><span>How naive. First, let’s welcome them with a barrage to liven things up.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_446"><span class="indent"><span>The special shells were still in the prototype stage, and only two shots had been prepared, but the blast area was still several dozen meters. Its explosive power far exceeded conventional explosive magic. The terrain would deform under the blast and heat of tens of thousands of degrees.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_447"><span class="indent"><span>Although Gaster’s command vehicle was the only one that featured this remarkable item, Gaster had no qualms about putting it into use. He promptly loaded it and pointed the muzzle at the forest. Then, he gave instructions to the entire tank division: prepare to intercept in case the enemy fled.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_448"><span class="indent"><span>“Left wing battalion, turn counterclockwise!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_449"><span class="indent"><span>The soldiers were setting up tents for the camp, but they remained alert given how the Dwarven Kingdom was only 30 kilometers away. Upon hearing Gaster’s command, they began to calmly clean up and stored their things on carts that were being towed by the tanks. Soon after, everyone was prepared for battle. Therefore, without a moment’s delay to Gaster’s orders, the left-wing battalion—comprised of 500 tanks—floated in the air and pointed their bodies toward the woods.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_450"><span class="indent"><span>And just like that, Gaster and his men were ready.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_451"><span class="indent"><span>It was almost like they had been waiting. From the depths of the overgrown forest, a single </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> emerged: a wolf-like </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> with two horns on its forehead.

Apparently, it is the </span><span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s pet, or whatever the hell they call it, but its ability is equivalent to A-plus rank</span></span><span class="indent"><span>…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_453"><span class="indent"><span>It was a powerful being.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_454"><span class="indent"><span>“Just one? What are they planning… No, I get it now.” Gaster thought about the reason behind this visit.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_455"><span class="italic indent"><span>Coming alone means that it’s not here for a fight. Perhaps it came here to warn us. That’s right, in order to protect his position as </span><span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, he can’t just abase himself in front of his enemies.

The level of tension became just right.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_458"><span class="indent"><span>Ranga edged closer.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_459"><span class="indent"><span>His footsteps were calm and showed no signs of belligerence. As Gaster had guessed, his goal was to negotiate. Ranga finally stopped once he was about ten meters away—a stone’s throw from Gaster and his crew.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_460"><span class="indent"><span>A woman, who was perched sideways atop, jumped down gracefully from his back, all without making a single sound. Then, without showing any signs of hesitation, she walked up to Gaster and the others. Gaster felt a chill run down his spine as if he’d been hit by an ice blade the moment he laid eyes on the woman’s unearthly beauty.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_461"><span class="italic indent"><span>What the…? This lady has a strange sound…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_462"><span class="indent"><span>The thudding of a beating heart was there, but it played an eerie melody. He could also hear her bloodstream, yet it was quieter and faster than a human’s. No, it was way too fast. The human body wouldn’t have been able to withstand such speeds if blood circulated at that rate…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_463"><span class="indent"><span>Gaster no longer paid any attention to Ranga. He only stared at the woman. Her long, pure white hair flowed flawlessly, accentuating her beauty. However, she was dressed in an imposing military uniform that contradicted her elegance. Her pants looked like jodhpurs, which were comfortably loose around her thighs.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_464"><span class="indent"><span>There was another person on Ranga’s back, but Gaster hadn’t realized it. This was how much the woman’s eerie presence had consumed Gaster’s focus.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_465"><span class="italic indent"><span>Who is she…? There was no mention of her on the intelligence reports. This woman might be more dangerous than Ranga, who is considered to be an executive!</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_466"><span class="indent"><span>Gaster wanted to give the information bureau a piece of his mind. Unfortunately, there was no one here to complain to. The fact that the </span><span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s aides had appeared right now was far more important than his grievances.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_467"><span class="indent"><span>Gaster spoke to the woman in a dignified manner as if to hide the fact that he felt pressured. “Are you a messenger of </span><span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>?

She waved her hand lightly and, at that moment, a wall of fire materialized one meter in front of the first row of tanks.

Then, she abruptly turned on her heels as if she had lost interest and began walking away.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_474"><span class="indent"><span>It was the signal that negotiations had ended. Ranga wagged his tail like it was the most natural thing to do. Only the small figure swaying on his back glanced at Gaster and the others, but Gaster paid him no mind.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_475"><span class="italic indent"><span>H-how dare you make a fool of me!

He felt as if everything he had believed in so far had been shattered, and instantly lost his composure. They unilaterally said whatever was on their mind and didn’t even listen to what Gaster and the others had to say.

That—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_477"><span class="indent"><span>The messenger’s attitude ignited Gaster’s anger, and the fear he felt until then had disappeared. As a result, Gaster made the wrong decision. </span><span data-term="Testarossa" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> was five meters away.

Showing courtesy to a messenger wasn’t something the Empire concerned itself with. It was okay if they surrendered. Otherwise, we simply had to completely trample them. In that case, </span><span data-term="Testarossa" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s behavior was an insult to the Empire, and hence a good reason to start the war.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_480"><span class="indent"><span>‹Can you hear me?›</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_481"><span class="indent"><span>‹Yes sir!

A bullet imbued with magic that had an initial velocity three times the speed of sound.

Torn between fear and humiliation, his humiliation eventually won. Normal soldiers didn’t understand what had just transpired. Only Gaster and the sniper understood the events that unfolded before them. If that was the case, then he could use the tank guns, their strongest weapon, to mow them down like they had originally planned to do. That way, he could protect his pride as an Imperial soldier.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_492"><span class="indent"><span>“Lieutenant General Gaster, w-what should we do?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_493"><span class="indent"><span>“Stay calm!

The entire town on the surface had been shoved to the bottom of the labyrinth—a temporary 101st floor. To get this far, you needed to defeat Veldora. And if that ever were to happen, common sense dictated that our defeat would’ve been inevitable.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_521"><span class="indent"><span>The last line of defense was Floor 95.

To be frank, that was quite a reckless thing to pull off. Thus, I hoped that the Floor Guardians did their best here. At the very least, the labyrinth’s defensive preparations were perfect.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_523"><span class="indent"><span>I mean, normal armies couldn’t break through the 95th floor even if they tried to. Naturally, all services in the labyrinth were halted because of the war. Stopping the sale of Resurrection Bracelets was a no-brainer, while inns and restrooms would be closed. In other words, our enemies were forced to prepare food and gather other resources by themselves. We also planned to shut off the water supply that was typically found on every 5th floor in order to increase the difficulty.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_524"><span class="indent"><span>If you were serious about attempting to conquer the labyrinth, then you had to set aside days, if not months.

Even if the Imperial Army was comparatively better, breaking through the labyrinth wouldn’t be so easy. Perhaps I was worrying a bit too much, but well, you could never be too careful. There was also the possibility that they would ignore and bypass the labyrinth, so we had no other choice but to wait and see what moves the enemy took.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_526"><span class="indent"><span>And just like that, everything was ready.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_527"><span class="indent"><span>The Empire’s movements had already been notified to neighboring nations, so they were most likely praying for our victory right now.

Since the caliber of the tank gun is 120mm, the mass of the shell is estimated to be approximately 21 kilograms. Based on the distance to the point of impact and elapsed travel time, the calculated speed is found to be less than six times the speed of sound. Kinetic energy is proportional to the product of mass of the shell and its velocity squared. From these conditions, the muzzle energy and penetration capability can be determined. The decrease in speed is inversely proportional to the transverse load, and air resistance has also been taken into account by simulating the surrounding environment. These values are then multiplied by the magical power coefficient hidden in the shell.

It might be due to a trend of the times, but the main reason was that they were determined to be inefficient in warfare. Magical fights were often thought of as flashy, when in reality it was a very modest task. All the magicians had to do was analyze and interfere with the enemy’s magic. At that time, they had to activate their own magic and hit their opponent’s army. This was repeated over and over again, and did not produce any significant results. This was because knights reinforced by magic were much stronger than sorcerers when it came down to actual combat.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_829"><span class="indent"><span>For example, nuclear magic has been touted as the most powerful type of magic, yet it required more than a dozen magicians to execute. It wasn’t something an individual could use, and constructing and casting the spell took up precious time.

Furthermore, although having additional magicians was advantageous, more did not always translate to better. This was due to the fact that magicules floating around the battlefield was finite, and once it was all expended, magicians became useless. Mages were an indispensable existence, but they were unarguably a mediocre existence.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_831"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Farage" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> was also a brilliant wizard and one of Master </span><span data-term="Gadra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s students.

The humiliation they suffered would be wiped away by the glory days that began now.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_848"><span class="indent"><span>Everyone felt the same way. With that common belief running through their mind, the one hundred airships strengthened their efforts…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_849"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_850"><span class="indent"><span>The biggest feature of the airship was the magic canceler generator, but it was also equipped with state-of-the-art weaponry. It was controlled by mages versed in elemental and summoning magic.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_851"><span class="indent"><span>The makeup of the airship was roughly divided into three departments: the operations, defense, and offensive. A hundred men were assigned to each of them, and the remaining hundred were held in reserve, where they worked on communication and medical affairs.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_852"><span class="indent"><span>Needless to say, the operations department operated the airship. A minimum of fifty people were required to fly the ship, but even a hundred personnel was insufficient if they wanted to operate the craft at full strength.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_853"><span class="indent"><span>The defense department was in charge of the airship’s ‘Defense Barrier’ and dealt with a variety of attacks such as anti-physics, anti-magic, and anti-element. The hull of the ship was kept thin in order to save weight. If they neglected to defend the airship with reinforcement magic, then they could easily be shot down. They were a critical department.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_854"><span class="indent"><span>Last was the offensive department, the star of the show. One of the weapons installed on the airship was the magic-amplified cannon, and this also served to facilitate cooperation between magicians. Multiple magicians could supply the mana orb on the pedestal with their mana at the same time. By chanting magic simultaneously, they could control powerful magic rather easily.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_855"><span class="indent"><span>There was a total of five magic-amplified cannons, one located in the front and two on either side of the ship, which required a maximum number of ten mages per gun. Substitute magicians were located in seats behind so that the cannon could be fired continuously. It was worth nothing that the power of the cannon increased in proportion to the number of users. For instance, if two people powered it, then it was four times stronger. Thus, if ten mages operated it consecutively, then the output would increase by a factor of 20.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_856"><span class="indent"><span>This was a menace. Even a simple fireball would become more powerful than a large magic fireball. It went without saying how much potential this possessed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_857"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_858"><span class="indent"><span>The airship’s defenses were flawless. The wyverns’ fireballs were like spitballs, and the barrier even prevented physical attacks. Half-baked attacks didn’t work and that satisfied </span><span data-term="Farage" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. Furthermore, its offensive capabilities—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_859"><span class="indent"><span>“Airships are the strongest of them all. It’s time to show your true potential. Swat those unsightly lizards out of the sky with maximum power!” </span><span data-term="Farage" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> passionately appealed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_860"><span class="indent"><span>So far, only two or three mages had been chanting magic. But the time for tests was over. The real show was about to begin. The magic-amplified cannon was activated by channeling mana into a spell control jewel. The jewel was about 50 centimeters in diameter and made of high-purity magic stone.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_861"><span class="indent"><span>The magicians who had been standing idly by now held out their hands and, with the combined might of ten people, unleashed large-scale magic. Lightning, ice, snow, flames, vacuum blades, and other terrifying magic blasted into the sky with a tremendous power 20 times greater than normal.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_862"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_863"><span class="indent"></span></p><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

In order to make sure those people understood that correctly, everyone’s minds became united.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2710"><span class="indent"><span>A heavy tension filled the room, and…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2711"><span class="indent"><span>“Hey, guys!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2712"><span class="indent"><span>“Yo, everyone.

That’s why, I want to hear everyone’s thoughts!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2716"><span class="indent"><span>And that was the signal for the meeting to begin.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2717"><span class="indent"><span>Kumara was the first to react.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2718"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh? It’s already been decided.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2719"><span class="indent"><span>She was about to express his thoughts as if she had been waiting for this very moment, but then Apito took her words away.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2720"><span class="indent"><span>“Just kill them all, I guess.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2721"><span class="indent"><span>Kumara and Apito glared at each other.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2722"><span class="indent"><span>“This time, you’ll be giving us a turn on our own floors, won’t you?

It was Veldora who calmed down the tension.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2725"><span class="indent"><span>“Kuahaha! Stop fighting, and be at ease. This time, everyone will have a chance to fight. From what I’ve heard, the enemy beliefs that the deepest part of the labyrinth is the 60th floor. Despite our outward propaganda that the maze has a hundred levels, they don’t believe it! Do people think it’s okay for them to be so stupid?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2726"><span class="italic indent"><span>No!</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;they all thought.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2727"><span class="indent"><span>Veldora nodded in agreement.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2728"><span class="indent"><span>“I had thought it would be fun to play along with it…But that seems like too much trouble.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2729"><span class="indent"><span>“Yes, that’s right! As the master just said, waiting for them to break through to the 50th floor would be very troublesome. Not only is it troublesome for us, but also for them.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2730"><span class="indent"><span>“Mhm. There are 700,000 of them out there right now. </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> told me to lure as many as I could into the labyrinth.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2731"><span class="indent"><span>“If they’re all crammed at the entrance, it’s going to take a long time, right? Plus, having too many enemies at once is also a problem.

Well, I personally think he’s worrying too much, but it would be a big win if we could find them.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2736"><span class="indent"><span>At Ramiris’ and Veldora’s words, the look in everyone’s eyes changed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2737"><span class="indent"><span>The </span><span data-term="Four Heavenly Kings" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> under </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> were the admiration of all those who were in charge of the labyrinth.

But since no one mentioned it out loud, the conversation went smoothly.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2739"><span class="indent"><span>“So that means…everyone has a chance, right?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2740"><span class="indent"><span>“If that’s the case, I have nothing to complain about.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2741"><span class="indent"><span>Hearing this, Apito and Kumara instantly became reconciled.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2742"><span class="indent"><span>The others, too, were full of enthusiasm, with their own ambitions in mind.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2743"><span class="indent"><span>“So, if anybody comes to our territory, we are free to do as we please?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2744"><span class="indent"><span>Hearing </span><span data-term="Adalmann" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> ask that, Ramiris answered, “That’s right!” This was the decisive blow, and the labyrinthine group became even more serious.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2745"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris continued with her explanation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2746"><span class="indent"><span>“We’re still getting more and more people coming in, but for now we’re just throwing them in one by one, starting from the 41st floor. Once we get 1,000 people, we will move down one floor at a time, so please keep that in mind! I’ll assign tasks and explain later.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2747"><span class="indent"><span>All the jealous eyes of those present focused on </span><span data-term="Gozer" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and </span><span data-term="Mezer" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> at once, and both of them began trembling nervously. Their bodies shrank even more, trying their best to get through this situation. They both agreed that it would be much better to fight against those foolish intruders than to keep going through this right now.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2748"><span class="indent"><span>Paying no mind to </span><span data-term="Gozer" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and the others, Ramiris’ explanation did not end.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2749"><span class="indent"><span>“So, we’re just going to accept them all and scatter them to each floor. In the end, we’ll have 100,000 of them going to the 41-50</span></span><span class="indent"><span>th</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;floors, 100,000 from the 51-60</span></span><span class="indent"><span>th</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;floors, 100,000 from the 61-70</span></span><span class="indent"><span>th</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;floors, 100,000 from the 71-80</span></span><span class="indent"><span>th</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;floors, and 100,000 from the 81-90</span></span><span class="indent"><span>th</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;floors. Then, each dragon king will take, probably 10,000 each? If more people come in, we’ll divide them amongst the upper floors!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2750"><span class="indent"><span>The maximum number of people accepted at one time would be 540,000. Ramiris said that she hoped to receive at least 350,000 as a minimum. Finally, she explained the most important matter.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2751"><span class="indent"><span>“Don’t forget that the rules of the labyrinth have been changed for this time only. Each dragon room has been enlarged ten times larger than usual, and the floors have all been replaced, so if someone breaks through the 90th floor, he or she will immediately enter the dragon room. But you see, this is not important. What really matters is that the conditions for clearing the rooms have changed!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2752"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris emphasized this as she flapped around.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2753"><span class="indent"><span>So just what were the conditions for clearing the maze?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2754"><span class="indent"><span>First of all, this time, once one entered the gate, they were not allowed to leave unless they cleared the maze. Since clearing the maze meant defeating Veldora, the game was essentially an all-out battle. In addition, it was necessary to collect the ten keys held by Elite Ten as a condition to challenge Veldora. In other words, even those who started from the 80th floor would need to go back to the upper floors to defeat other Elite Ten and get all the keys.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2755"><span class="indent"><span>Upon hearing this, a look of satisfaction appeared on the faces of the Elite Ten. The dragon kings roared in all directions in the hall.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2756"><span class="indent"><span>“In that case, I guess we all have an equal opportunity.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2757"><span class="indent"><span>“Yes, that’s right. It’s a race to see who can kill the most prey.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2758"><span class="indent"><span>And then sparks began fly among them.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2759"><span class="indent"><span>“Huh. I hope I have a worthy opponent to really swing my sword against.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2760"><span class="indent"><span>“Don’t be too arrogant, </span><span data-term="Albert" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, we only have to think about destroying the enemies of our god.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2761"><span class="indent"><span>And then began a squabble between master and servant. Others also began meditating quietly. Everyone seemed to be in high spirits for the battle to come.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2762"><span class="indent"><span>Standing before the Dungeon’s Elite Ten, Beretta, who was considered to be the chief, opened their mouth.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2763"><span class="indent"><span>“By the way, Ramiris-sama, I’ve been asking you for a while now…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2764"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh, that. Well, </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> has given his approval, so let’s just see how it goes this time.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2765"><span class="indent"><span>“Thank you very much.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2766"><span class="indent"><span>After exchanging some words with Ramiris, Beretta stood up and looked around at the Elite Ten.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2767"><span class="indent"><span>“Gentlemen. I have been given the role of Dungeon Master by Ramiris-sama. I was also the head of the Elite Ten…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2768"><span class="indent"><span>Beretta personally believed that the position of the head of the Elite Ten was nothing more than a chore. Beretta was only included in the Elite Ten to make up the number of members, because ten members were needed for the sake of consistency.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2769"><span class="indent"><span>The names of his positions and titles were also changed quite frequently, perhaps reflecting Ramiris’s loose character. The worst one was “Ramiris’s errand boy”, which was, to say the least, unwanted.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2770"><span class="indent"><span>As for his colleague, </span><span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, she was valued by Ramiris even though they were in the same position. The reason for this was that she never scolded Ramiris. Beretta personally thought that this was too much. </span><span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> was still doing as she pleased. She seemed to have gotten Ramiris’ approval, and had gone off somewhere without Beretta’s knowledge.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2771"><span class="indent"><span>Beretta sighed secretly. In any case, they were now being called the head of the Elite Ten just to make up the numbers. Beretta was not happy about it, so they wanted to give the position in the Dungeon’s Elite Ten to someone else.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2772"><span class="indent"><span>Now, that long-awaited opportunity had arrived.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2773"><span class="indent"><span>“I will give up my position to the one who performs well in this battle.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2774"><span class="indent"><span>In that moment, the Elite Ten’s eyes all lit up.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2775"><span class="indent"><span>Even </span><span data-term="Gozer" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and </span><span data-term="Mezer" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> began to harbor ambitions that were out of their league, thinking that perhaps they could join the Elite Ten.

However, it would be a disgrace for him as an Imperial general to be discouraged by such a situation. The commander decided to continue with the invasion. It was the right decision.

However, they were running out of time, and were not able to achieve the desired results. In the end, it was not until the end of the third day that they had finished exploring all of the floors.

From there, the sounds of battle echoed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3022"><span class="indent"><span>“Damn those </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>—they’re back!” One of them shouted in a rage.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3023"><span class="indent"><span>Ahead of their eyes, a huge snake, an incarnation of darkness, was writhing about in the passageway.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3024"><span class="indent"><span>It was a tempest serpent. Neither magic nor bullets could penetrate its armor-like scales. Even if you tried to cut them with a sword, the ‘Poison Breath’ of the Tempest serpent could reach up to seven meters away.

This narrow passageway is made for them!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3026"><span class="indent"><span>“We can get around them in the open, but there is no way to get around them in here!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3027"><span class="indent"><span>“How’s the magic cannon coming along?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3028"><span class="indent"><span>“No good. We just used it. It’ll take two hours to fill it up.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3029"><span class="indent"><span>The “magic cannon” was a new type of magic weapon that was the most powerful of all hand-held weapons. Unlike the “spell gun” which used a magic stone as its energy source, the “magic cannon” collected magicules from the atmosphere.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3030"><span class="indent"><span>The hidden magic was an elemental magic: ‘Air Buster’, a high-powered magic that continuously exploded the air after compressing it. It did not emit flames and could be directional. Therefore, it was useful in enclosed spaces such as inside of buildings.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3031"><span class="indent"><span>It was an advanced magic, and only by being able to control it could one be certified as an A-rank magic user.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3032"><span class="indent"><span>The problem, however, was that it consumed too much energy.

The most important point was that it revived after 3 hours no matter how many times it was defeated. In other words, no matter how many times they conquered it, the battle would be resumed due to the passage of time. Most troublesome of all was the fact that there was no safe zone in this floor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3035"><span class="indent"><span>And then…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3036"><span class="indent"><span>The sounds of battle began to echo in another corridor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3037"><span class="indent"><span>That’s right, the Tempest Serpent was not alone.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3038"><span class="indent"><span>There were ten of them at least that had been confirmed.

As a result, they secured enough magic cannons to outnumber the tempest serpents.

Instead, golems powered by magicules are roaming about. Trouble is, they seem to have a self-repairing function, and it took us a long time to completely destroy them.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3059"><span class="indent"><span>“I’m sorry to hear that.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3060"><span class="indent"><span>The commander wanted to say that they had had a hard time too, but he swallowed his words firmly and urged on.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3061"><span class="indent"><span>“Yeah. The tired and wounded are resting on the fifty-fifth floor. Once there, it will be safe enough to have a meal.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3062"><span class="indent"><span>“Thank you.

Even so, do you still want to hear it?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3064"><span class="indent"><span>The soldier answered with a sigh, and as a unit commander, he had no choice but to nod his head.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3065"><span class="indent"><span>“Yes, please.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3066"><span class="indent"><span>“Okay.

Even if A-rank warriors formed a mob to challenge it, they could not even grasp a clue of how to conquer it. The body was made of magisteel, and physical attacks such as swords and guns could not penetrate it. Moreover, it was always covered with a ‘barrier’ and even the ‘magic cannon’ would not work against it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3068"><span class="indent"><span>There was nothing they could do—That was the current situation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3069"><span class="indent"><span>“Later, voices were heard coming from the giant golem, but it was such a surprise!

The commander did not have an alternative plan, and he did not object to this approach. However, this was only a postponement of the problem.

They established a stronghold in the passage they had conquered, and showed that they could respond to the onslaught immediately.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3162"><span class="indent"><span>The bugs, dozens of times larger than normal, were not only terrifying but also powerful. If they were not careful, they would be devoured in an instant.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3163"><span class="indent"><span>However, if one kept a cool head, they would be able to recognize that each and every one of them was not so strong individually. Besides, the fact that they never stopped meant that the number of “magic crystals” they could get was huge.

Then they would be defeated eventually because they would not be able to exert their full strength. However, the soldiers did not have to worry about that. If a well-trained army was attacking, a swarm of bugs was no match for them. No matter how many bugs there were, the imperial army still outnumbered them.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3166"><span class="indent"><span>They could replace and change shifts whenever they got tired, and they always maintained their readiness.

On the other hand, there was also a great deal to be gained. This floor, a paradise for insects, also had a number of traps and hidden rooms, such as tree caves and caverns.

They must have been the ones who opened the treasure chest in the previous room and found a dagger inside. It was an expensive looking dagger with gold and silver works. It seemed to be of excellent quality, and the gleam of the blade was proof that it was made of magisteel. The dagger was made only of magisteel, even &nbsp;though a dagger made with a core of magisteel would be expensive. It was no wonder the soldier was smiling.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3169"><span class="indent"><span>It was explained that “magic crystals” and other items would be kept by the military upon entering this labyrinth. However, if it was a small item like a dagger, there was a high possibility that certain things will be overlooked.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3170"><span class="indent"><span>Of course, the soldiers would have their belongings inspected later, but considering the credit of defeating the boss guarding the treasure, it was certain that the item would belong to this soldier.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3171"><span class="indent"><span>The soldiers around him looked envious, but they all secretly thought that this was a chance for their turn to be next.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3172"><span class="indent"><span>If it weren’t for such perks, they wouldn’t have been able to continue fighting against the insects in a place like this.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3173"><span class="indent"><span>There were quite a few “magic crystals” that had been collected.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3174"><span class="indent"><span>High purity “magic crystals”, which would be rare under normal circumstances, could be easily obtained here just by defeating </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3175"><span class="indent"><span>This was exactly what was meant when it was said that the soldiers couldn’t stop smiling.

His inarticulate voice came to a halt mid-sentence, and his mouth hung open in shock.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3184"><span class="indent"><span>Blood spurted upwards. Like a fountain, it poured back down on the others around him.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3185"><span class="indent"><span>“H-Hey!” screamed a soldier. The sudden devastation of the person he had been speaking with was difficult to comprehend.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3186"><span class="indent"><span>But that soldier was lucky.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3187"><span class="indent"><span>He was chosen as the next victim before even being able to think.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3188"><span class="indent"><span>Another head dropped to the floor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3189"><span class="indent"><span>Just like the first soldier, who had become a silent corpse, that man soon died.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3190"><span class="indent"><span>Their place of death was the seventy-ninth floor.

The suit design was the same as that of a typical officer’s suit, but the fabric was different. Every thread had been carefully selected and mana had been kneaded into the fabric.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3722"><span class="indent"><span>This was a luxury item that was equivalent to the annual salary of a colonel, promising to be comfortable enough to satisfy even the most fashionable Minits.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3723"><span class="indent"><span>Elegance was what Minits was all about. As such, Minits was not happy about this operation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3724"><span class="indent"><span>In war, one should aim for a victory without fighting by overwhelming the enemy with overwhelming force. Sacrificing lives was out of the question, and when it was happening in their own army, it was no wonder that the commander’s ability was questioned. Because of this, Minits had declared that this operation was a failure even before the result.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3725"><span class="indent"><span>However…he was not so sure about the results of the operation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3726"><span class="indent"><span>“Well, I guess it’s the sadness of being in the palace service as an official that I can’t say such an obvious fact.” Minits smiled wryly while he complained.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3727"><span class="indent"><span>Although he was not usually the center of attention because Kansas, his subordinate, always stood out, Minits himself was one of the bravest men in the Imperial Army. He did not have a soft heart to give up a war in the middle of a battle because it went against his aesthetics.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3728"><span class="indent"><span>“But then again, </span><span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> is quite the cruel man. It’s a natural course of action, but to send me, the commander, to a completely different place… This way, the brave men who gathered this time might all be defeated by a small number. Well, at least Kansas-kun seems to have survived…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3729"><span class="indent"><span>Minits talked to himself, as if he did not care who heard. Despite the content of his words, he seemed to be enjoying himself. It was no wonder that Minits was elated for the first time in a long time. He had never been exposed to such a dangerous situation since he was born. He was in a position where he himself was rarely allowed to even be in the front line.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3730"><span class="indent"><span>Minits was not a maverick, but rather an upper-class individual from an aristocratic family. In fact, he was even more higher-ranked than </span><span data-term="Calgurio" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> when outside of the military. He was well-connected in the political world and had established his own faction.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3731"><span class="indent"><span>The reason why Minits still belonged to the military was because he loved fighting. Minits loved the sight of blood. And now that he had this opportunity, he could go on a rampage to his heart’s content. The thought of it made Minits’s cheeks loosen.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3732"><span class="indent"><span>Minits had been sent to the seventy-eighth floor, one floor above the floor ruled by Apito. The reason for this was to see how Minits fared before analyzing his abilities.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3733"><span class="indent"><span>So Minits went to the lower floors, kicking away insects as if he were walking in an uninhabited field.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3734"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh dear, I don’t like bugs. Just seeing their legs wriggle makes me feel sickened. I’ve got to get out of this place as soon as possible.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3735"><span class="indent"><span>With a single, arrogant wave of his hand, Minits swung his hand to the side. With that, a gust of wind blew, and the numerous insects were broken up into dust.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3736"><span class="indent"><span>This was the power of Minits.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3737"><span class="indent"><span>It was his Unique Skill ‘Oppressor’.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3738"><span class="indent"><span>This power was simple and clear. From psychological oppression to physical compression, it affected everything in Minits’s field of vision. There was no way to escape from it, and everything would disappear in a cloud of dust.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3739"><span class="indent"><span>In fact, an object could be destroyed with just a glance, without even the need to wave an arm. Minits had been undefeated until now, thanks to this power.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3740"><span class="indent"><span>“How brittle. They’re too boring and unresponsive. I wish they would try harder.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3741"><span class="indent"><span>No one could stop Minits now. A swarm of bugs of Over A rank appeared on the seventy-eighth floor, but all of them were killed by Minits. They were no match for him, and the battle was won in an instant.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3742"><span class="indent"><span>He seemed truly invincible. The arrogance of Minits was understandable with this power.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3743"><span class="indent"><span>Minits discovers the staircase in a few hours. Going at his own pace as always, he began to take a rest, as if he was simply going camping.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3744"><span class="indent"><span>The leather bag on his waist was a high-end magic travel bag. From it, he pulled out a freshly prepared meal to enjoy. The bag even contained a set of bedding with a roof over it to ward off evil spirits, and later Minits went to sleep without a care in the world.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3745"><span class="indent"><span>Minits even slept without a care in the world.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3746"><span class="indent"><span>Then came the next day.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3747"><span class="indent"><span>Minits stepped into the seventy-ninth floor with ease, and there he met his true enemy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3748"><span class="indent"><span>The </span><span data-term="Silent Killer Wasps" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>—these were the Army Wasps that had attacked Minits, and Minits was the first one to get a glimpse of their abilities. No matter how nasty the </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> was, the battle was decided as soon as they entered his sight.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3749"><span class="indent"><span>“Well, these </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> here are no match for me either. How disappointing!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3750"><span class="indent"><span>Seeing Minits talking so boldly, one of them became furious.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3751"><span class="indent"><span>It was Apito.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3752"><span class="indent"><span>Minits showed that he could handle any angle of sneaking up on him. It was obvious that Minits had mastered ‘</span><span data-term="Magic Perception" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’. If that was the case, it was pointless to force the Army Wasps any further. So, the queen herself came to the front.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3753"><span class="indent"><span>“Humans, how dare you say such a thing!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3754"><span class="indent"><span>“Is that so? You’re a bit too pushy, aren’t you? To me, I don’t see much of a difference between you and these insects…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3755"><span class="indent"><span>At those words, Minits trampled the carcasses of the dead wasps on the ground. This action made Apito’s anger flare up even more fiercely.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3756"><span class="indent"><span>“I’m going to kill you.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3757"><span class="indent"><span>“Just try it!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3758"><span class="indent"><span>Thus, the two heroes clashed fiercely.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3759"><span class="indent"><span>At first, Minits thought very little of Apito.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3760"><span class="indent"><span>Not that he was careless, but he thought that his own ‘Oppressor’ would break Apito into pieces. However, he soon realized that he was being naive.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3761"><span class="indent"><span>An interference wave was emitted on the line of sight, and Apito became pressured heavily. It was an invisible force of attraction. Minits was able to influence the surrounding matter and give direction to the pulling force.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3762"><span class="indent"><span>The gravitational pull of a massive star was used to repel matter in all directions. By successfully manipulating the tensile and repulsive forces, Minits was able to explode or compress objects.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3763"><span class="indent"><span>The only way to resist this force was to have a strong body that was not easily moved, or to release a directional wave that canceled out the interference waves.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3764"><span class="indent"><span>Minits had never met anyone who could do such a thing. In other words, Minits felt invincible. With such absolute confidence, Minits activated his ability. However, the scene that appeared was different from what Minits had expected.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3765"><span class="indent"><span>“Too slow!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3766"><span class="indent"><span>Minits had only shattered an afterimage of Apito. Apito had not discovered the true nature of Minits’s power, but she had noticed that it was directional. She guessed that she could escape from the area of effect if she moved quickly enough, and she showed a remarkable evasion.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3767"><span class="indent"><span>“</span><span data-term="fufufu" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, I was right.

If this wasn’t the case, the battle would be too boring!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3771"><span class="indent"><span>He unleashed his abilities to the fullest and formed a force field around himself. At the same time, he stepped forward to block Apito’s path.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3772"><span class="indent"><span>Apito had no choice but to fall back. The passage of the labyrinth is five meters wide, but if she tried to slip through beside Minits, she would be trapped by the force field.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3773"><span class="indent"><span>“Damn, that’s nasty.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3774"><span class="indent"><span>“That’s what I’m talking about!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3775"><span class="indent"><span>Neither side gave an inch.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3776"><span class="indent"><span>Apito’s movements had become even more refined and sharp with her training with </span><span data-term="Hinata" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. Apito was able to spar against even the leader of Holy Knights, but it was meaningless if she could not get close to him.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3777"><span class="indent"><span>It was also dangerous to stop herself from moving. If Apito was caught by the interference wave, she would not be safe.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3778"><span class="italic indent"><span>It was a bad idea to come out here. If I retreat to the queen’s room, I would be able to fly around more freely. I don’t know how long this man’s power will last, but the only way to find a chance is to go back.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3779"><span class="indent"><span>Apito decided as such. There was no shame in running away. A greedy pursuit for victory was Apito’s basic policy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3780"><span class="indent"><span>Minits did not make fun of Apito when she ran away. He saw it as a strategic retreat and, on the contrary, pursued her cautiously.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3781"><span class="indent"><span>There was no need to hurry. Rather than pushing too hard at this point, he prioritized to conserve his strength.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3782"><span class="italic indent"><span>Fighting must be done gracefully. But it is better to struggle in vain than to lose.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3783"><span class="indent"><span>Minits found Apito beautiful.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3784"><span class="indent"><span>Unlike the other </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, he saw Apito as an opponent with aesthetics.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3785"><span class="indent"><span>It was natural for a warrior to choose the battlefield that was favorable to them. Minits did not laugh at this, but rather, appreciated the fact that they were doing their best to fight against him.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3786"><span class="indent"><span>Minits chased after Apito, not underestimating his opponent, but thinking of how to corner her.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3787"><span class="indent"><span>He arrived at a large open space.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3788"><span class="indent"><span>There was a chair on a higher platform.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3789"><span class="italic indent"><span>Apparently, this is the throne where the queen reigns.

I am the one who will kill you, Major General Minits-kun. Let’s move on to the second round!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3794"><span class="indent"><span>With that, Minits accelerated.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3795"><span class="indent"><span>This was only a wait-and-see move, but it was the real deal. The speed was not faster than Apito’s, but not so fast that he would fall behind.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3796"><span class="indent"><span>However, Apito was not fazed by this. Rising high into the sky, Apito sped up in an attempt to play a trick on Minits.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3797"><span class="indent"><span>But this was within Minits’s expectations.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3798"><span class="indent"><span>“How naive. Don’t underestimate my power!” he shouted after he had unleashed his power.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3799"><span class="indent"><span>An invisible force field was generated near the ceiling of the domed hall, which caught Apito.

I guess they don’t want to catch me off guard. If that’s the case, are they concentrating their forces?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3933"><span class="indent"><span>Kansas’ insight was fearsome.

Well then, I’ll feel free to visit!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3935"><span class="indent"><span>That boldness of Kansas was one of his virtues.

But so am I. I didn’t think you would be able to summon three tailed beasts when you are just a kid. Clayman seems to have trained you well.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3984"><span class="indent"><span>He was confident in his attitude, but there is a reason for it. The magic beasts summoned by Kansas were stronger than the eight under Kumara.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3985"><span class="indent"><span>“How troublesome. Let’s end the fun now.” As soon as he said so, Kansas added more magic beasts.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3986"><span class="indent"><span>“No way! A dark tiger and a dark snake!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3987"><span class="indent"><span>Comparing the strength of each of these magic beasts, Kansas’ magic beasts were stronger. And that’s as it should be. These magic beasts were the faithful guardians of the previous nine-heads who belonged to Kumara’s mothers.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3988"><span class="indent"><span>Five such powerful magic beasts. They had lost their gentle and calm temperament from those days, and were now standing in front of her, unleashing their ferocious instincts.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3989"><span class="indent"><span>Kansas thought that he had won at this point. No matter how much Kumara, a young fox cub, had grown up, she could only control three tailed beasts at most.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3990"><span class="indent"><span>Even Kumara’s mother could only produce five tailed beasts. He had thought that Kumara, who had lived only a few hundred years, would never be able to produce such power, even if she became a fox who had lived for thousands of years.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3991"><span class="indent"><span>That’s why Kansas spoke to her arrogantly.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3992"><span class="indent"><span>“I’d be happy to keep you as my lapdog if that’s what you are now.

I’ll spare your life.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3993"><span class="indent"><span>His tone of voice was more like an order than a negotiation. It was a statement based on the certainty of his victory. But Kansas was fatally mistaken.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3994"><span class="indent"><span>Kumara became furious. Her smile became deeper and more beautiful.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3995"><span class="indent"><span>“You’re a funny guy. You must have prepared to make me so angry, didn’t you?” She asked, but no answer was needed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3996"><span class="indent"><span>Kumara unleashed her tailed beasts—all eight of them.

Eight of them? You…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3998"><span class="indent"><span>This was the first time Kansas showed agitation, but it was only for a moment. He immediately regained his composure and smiled wryly.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3999"><span class="indent"><span>“I commend you that you have grown so much to the point that you surprised me. But I still have the advantage.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4000"><span class="indent"><span>“Shut up!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4001"><span class="indent"><span>“How terrible. In that case, I’ll say no more. I’ll rip off your hands and feet and hang them in my room.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4002"><span class="indent"><span>The negotiations were over. And so began the battle of eight against five.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4003"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4004"><span class="indent"><span>The eight were more advantageous in terms of numbers, but the opponents were elites who had served their predecessors for a long time. The amount of magicules they had accumulated was different. Above all, their experience is different.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4005"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Byakuren" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> was not weak by any means, but the dark magic beasts were so strong that they overturned the numerical disadvantage.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4006"><span class="indent"><span>As time passed, the Eight beasts began to be pushed back. But Kumara still did not give up.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4007"><span class="indent"><span>Observing Kansas, she noticed one thing. The magic beasts summoned by Kansas were individually very powerful. Moreover, they seem to have lost their memories completely, but they also seemed to have retained their rationality. They responded quickly to Kansas’s instructions and dealt with the eight beasts.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4008"><span class="indent"><span>Conversely, this meant that Kumara had a chance to win if she could defeat Kansas, the leader. Besides, Kumara still had another trick up her sleeve. All she has to do was recall the eight members back to her and become her true self.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4009"><span class="indent"><span>Kumara judged that if she did so, she would be superior to Kansas. Kumara, therefore, analyzed the war situation without hesitation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4010"><span class="indent"><span>And what about Kansas? He looked as if things were going fine, but he was actually on the edge of his limits. There was a reason why Kansas was leading the dark magic beasts. Kansas’s power was the secret.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4011"><span class="indent"><span>Unique Skill ‘Marauder’—that was the power that Kansas possessed. This power was meaningless by itself. It was a power that had no effect. Kansas first became aware of this power when he was a child. He killed a dog owned by a friend of his in revenge for a quarrel over a trivial matter. Then, he was able to summon a dark dog.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4012"><span class="indent"><span>This alone was only a little useful in battle, but the real value of this power lay elsewhere. This was revealed when Kansas joined the army and defeated the guerrillas on the frontier. He was able to summon a “darkness” that was as powerful as the ones he had killed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4013"><span class="indent"><span>Then Kansas realized. He could only summon the darkness from those he had killed. This meant that the more he killed, the stronger he would become. Skill and the shape of the person he killed could be reproduced perfectly. It was a very versatile Skill, useful for disguising oneself in an undercover mission. But there was a limit. His power did not add up all of the power of those he killed, but was only up to the power of the strongest opponent he had killed. If that were possible, it would mean that Kansas could control an army by himself. There was no such universalism, and there was a limit to the value of Kansas’ existence.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4014"><span class="indent"><span>Kumara saw through it correctly. Therefore, there was no need to panic even if the current situation was unfavorable.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4015"><span class="indent"><span>“I understand. You have reached your limit, haven’t you?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4016"><span class="indent"><span>“Then so what?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4017"><span class="indent"><span>“I don’t know how you’re controlling those dark beats, but it doesn’t matter. Because all I have to do is kill you.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4018"><span class="indent"><span>This was Kumara’s analysis of the war situation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4019"><span class="indent"><span>Although the forces of the subordinates were in competition, the commanders of both sides were not participating in the battle. If Kumara took out Kansas, he would not be able to give orders to the magical beasts of darkness. And if Kumara and Kansas were to be compared, Kumara was far superior in the amount of magicules.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4020"><span class="indent"><span>“Don’t worry. Your death will not be easy.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4021"><span class="indent"><span>As soon as she announced this, Kumara vanished from the scene and took Kansas’ back in an instant. She then tried to slit his neck with her outstretched claws.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4022"><span class="indent"><span>Kansas responded with a show. He admitted that Kumara was right, but still maintained a relaxed attitude.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4023"><span class="indent"><span>“That’s scary. If I had known you would grow up to be this big, I should have killed you at that time.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4024"><span class="indent"><span>“Shut up!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4025"><span class="indent"><span>“Kukuku, don’t be so angry. I’ll show you something funny in return for your apology.” Saying so, Kansas laughed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4026"><span class="indent"><span>Indeed, Kansas’s ‘Marauder’ only had the power to summon those he had killed. There was a limit to how many he could summon, and the power that Kansas himself had gained was only as strong as the strongest person he had ever defeated. However, Kansas was hiding a secret trick. Without hesitation, he decided to disclose it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4027"><span class="indent"><span>“Why do you think I sold you to Clayman? Why do you think I gave you up even though I knew you would be a great asset? It was because…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4028"><span class="indent"><span>He had more power than Kumara, and he could have easily tamed and nurtured Kumara.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4029"><span class="indent"><span>Kansas obliterated the magic beasts of darkness and summoned a single giant beast to take their place. This was the source of Kansas’ power and the reason he did not need Kumara.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4030"><span class="indent"><span>“Th-that, it looks like…Mother?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4031"><span class="indent"><span>A dark fox appeared. It had five thick tails and four thin ones. With a total of nine tales, it was the mistress of the “youma village”. However, her appearance had become a disaster, and there was no trace of the kindly face she had when she was alive.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4032"><span class="indent"><span>“Haaaaaahaha! That’s right. This is your mother. But by being manipulated by me, she’s learned to wield her maniacal power to the fullest. It’s wonderful. Wouldn’t you like to see it?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4033"><span class="indent"><span>Her gentle nature became a curse, and she showed mercy to her enemies. Therefore, even though she was as powerful as a </span><span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, she had lived a modest life, hiding and hiding, minimizing her interactions with the world.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4034"><span class="indent"><span>Such was the case with the previous generation. Now, through the hands of Kansas, her true power was unleashed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4035"><span class="indent"><span>“Do you even mock the dead?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4036"><span class="indent"><span>“No, I’m not. It’s respect. I’m trying to put it to good use, and I want you to thank me for it.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4037"><span class="indent"><span>The dark nine-head that Kansas summoned flares up at the sight of Kumara. There was no emotion in her eyes. She only took one look at Kumara with the eyes of an enemy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4038"><span class="indent"><span>“Mother…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4039"><span class="indent"><span>“Kill her.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4040"><span class="indent"><span>Following an order, the nine heads moved. The next moment, the dark tailed beasts united in a single all-out blow, cleaving the eight heads in half.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4041"><span class="indent"><span>“</span><span data-term="Yoda" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, </span><span data-term="Igami" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>—?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4042"><span class="indent"><span>The two that were too late to move were seriously wounded by the blow and returned to Kumara’s tail. That’s how powerful it was. It was obvious that the eight beasts had no chance.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4043"><span class="indent"><span>“Hahaha! Isn’t this funny? This power is the reason I don’t need you. But with all those tails, you’re better than your mother. What you lack in experience, I make up for in experience. Kukuku, I’m glad I let you live. If I get ahold of you here too, then I’ll have even more power!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4044"><span class="indent"><span>Kansas exulted. He had no intention of losing. He possessed the strongest nine heads, and an equally strengthened self. With such a strong force, there was no way he could be defeated by the little fox. Kansas is convinced of this.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4045"><span class="indent"><span>Kansas considered even Clayman to be of a lower rank.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4046"><span class="indent"><span>He had thought that he could defeat the new </span><span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> only after he had mastered the power of the Nine Heads, which was comparable to that of the </span><span data-term="demon" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> Lords.

I fully understand that.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4116"><span class="indent"><span>Minits held up one hand to hold his opponent’s greeting. If they were senior officers or above, he remembered their names and affiliations. Minits, however, had no memory of those in front of him.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4117"><span class="indent"><span>That meant only one thing…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4118"><span class="indent"><span>In this labyrinth, even those of Over A rank would have had a hard time surviving.

It’s a miracle that we survived.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4139"><span class="indent"><span>Bazin interrupted the conversation between Krishna and Minits. His words were full of anger, and he seemed to regret in disappointment. It was obvious to everyone that he meant what he said.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4140"><span class="indent"><span>“You’re being rude to the Major General, Bazin.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4141"><span class="indent"><span>“But, Reicha-san…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4142"><span class="indent"><span>“No, I don’t care. This labyrinth is dangerous. We can help each other here to survive, regardless of our status.” Minits verbally offered to cooperate.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4143"><span class="indent"><span>If the other party was the Emperor’s guard, he had no complaints about his ability.

What happened after they left this labyrinth was something they could think about when we got out. This was the moment when the four of them came to a common understanding.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4147"><span class="indent"><span>“So, how did Minits-sama get here?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4148"><span class="indent"><span>“I was dealing with a group of Army Wasps.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4149"><span class="indent"><span>“Army Wasps…!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4150"><span class="indent"><span>The most dangerous </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> in the world.

But more importantly, what route did you take to get to this room?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4159"><span class="indent"><span>Minits was in charge. Although they were treated as equals, Minits still had the upper hand over Krishna and the others. Minits took the lead in sharing the information they had obtained. It turned out that the labyrinth had a distorted structure.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4160"><span class="indent"><span>The reality was so different from the previous reports that there was nothing to base it on.

With such a flowery mindset, I would be unable to take responsibility for the real damage.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_6103"><span class="indent"><span>That is why I did not care about those who could not come back to life.
