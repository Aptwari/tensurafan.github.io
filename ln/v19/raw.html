class="c1">To revive the &ldquo;Star King Dragon&rdquo; Veldanava in a complete form was not possible for the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; who was only a mere Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But even so, he couldn&rsquo;t help but hope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">A world without Veldanava was of no value to Michael.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael opened his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He shook his head lightly to shake off the lingering sentiment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a bit confused at the feeling, as if his emotions were being exposed for the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">I thought that I wasn&rsquo;t as naive as Rudra, but I guess I was wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the end, that was the conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Trust no one and use everyone as pawns&mdash;If that had been done that from the start, then Obera&rsquo;s betrayal could have been prevented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He hadn&rsquo;t done that because he believed in Feldway. He thought that Feldway&rsquo;s friends, the people he trusted, would also be trustworthy to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was a mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Salvation King Azrael&rsquo; that he had tethered to his hand had returned, Michael realized that he had failed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera had betrayed them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She had used her administrative privileges to erase &lsquo;Salvation King Azrael&rsquo; and escape from Michael&rsquo;s control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In order to make up for that loss, he had used Feldway to reinforce his control over the Angelic Skill Holders currently under control through the Ultimate Dominion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">With that, there is no problem with the Phantoms. The Insectars may betray us, but our interests are still aligned. Monitoring will be essential, but once the battlefield is prepared, we&rsquo;ll be able to handle the rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The battlefield was the land where the contract with the Insectars took place. Michael had promised Zelanus that he could carve out any area he wanted and make it his domain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If anyone lived there, the Insectars would take care of them. In other words, Michael intended to send Zelanus to the fiercest battleground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The location would slowly be determined, but there were several problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The first, needless to say, was how to deal with Obera&rsquo;s betrayal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Phantoms were loyal to Feldway, so there was no need to worry about a drop in morale. He could have even postponed the decision judging by the threat level, but he had a feeling that it would be a bad idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera&rsquo;s role had been to monitor the &ldquo;World-destroying Dragon&rdquo; Ivarage. Now, however, that importance had been diminished. Whatever happened in the Otherworld was none of Michael&rsquo;s concern, and if anything, the situation of Ivarage&rsquo;s manifestation in the Cardinal World was incorporated into his strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, he didn&rsquo;t care if Obera abandoned her mission. However, it would be a different story if she tried to cooperate with the enemy forces such as Demon Lord Rimuru or Demon Lord Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In order to nip such concerns in the bud, taking the initiative seemed more certain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, who should they send?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was the main question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was also related to the following issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Should they proceed to the next target as planned? If they were going to take out Obera, shouldn&rsquo;t the plan be revised?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was not a trivial matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, the troops under Obera&rsquo;s command were a part of Michael&rsquo;s army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The loss of strength due to his mistake made Michael feel uncomfortable. This was also a new experience for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Emotion was something that Michael, as a Manas, had a difficult time understanding. And yet, recently, his thoughts had been disturbed like a noise in a song.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So he suddenly had the thought to enjoy the feeling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">If this is an &ldquo;emotion,&rdquo; then perhaps I should consider myself lucky. Even if there is only one perfect answer, there are innumerable ways to get there. The shortest way is not necessarily the right way, so I can be forgiven for enjoying the process.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If one&rsquo;s emotions are disturbed every time a problem arises, then it is better to just enjoy it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Impatience narrowed one&rsquo;s field of vision, and anger would dull the thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Regret was meaningless, and the most constructive thing to do was to avoid making more mistakes in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If that was the case, then he had found a solution to his current problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;That&rsquo;s right. I, myself, should defeat the rebels.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Any losses should be recovered within the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rather than imposing one&rsquo;s own mistakes onto others, it was better to make up for them as soon as possible. That way, he would not have to worry about opening more wounds and would be able to calmly tackle the next problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael&rsquo;s mood lifted as soon as he came to that conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was also his first time ever experiencing this&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">&ldquo;Emotions&rdquo; are not so bad after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what Michael felt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the Otherworld, there is no such thing as gravity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It is similar to outer space in that there is no concept of earth and sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">There are only objects made of condensed magicules scattered throughout the empty space. Such objects were as strong as magisteel, and generated powerful gravitational forces, so they were processed to be used as &lsquo;bases&rsquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The former angels, the Phantoms, used such bases to live a life similar to one in the Cardinal World, so as not to forget their lives in a gravitational field.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The base of Obera, which was comparable in size to an asteroid, was the frontline base against Ivarage. Its strength was unrivaled by any other bases and was one of the most important facilities for the Phantoms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael jumped towards that base.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo; was used from the Heavenly Star Palace, Obera&rsquo;s base was already empty. However, Michael immediately sensed the presence of a large army nearby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">Over there</span><span class="c1">&mdash;Michael thought, as he turned his gaze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera also seemed to have noticed Michael&rsquo;s presence and immediately responded by taking an intercepting stance. With unhindered movements, she and the others had formed a full-blown formation and turned their hostility towards Michael.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Because there was no ground and sky, the type of formation was different from that on earth. A &lsquo;full-sky formation&rsquo; was a tactic that was built on the premise that the enemy was small in number. It aimed at annihilation of the enemy by encircling them from above, below, right, and left.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a successful formation against cryptids.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The cryptids were specialized in their individual fighting ability and rarely swarmed together. Therefore, using a tactic that encircled them in large numbers was very effective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera had always been at the forefront of the battle, and her command was excellent. The soldiers who responded to her were also worthy of praise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">Ah, it really is a shame. At any rate, I wish I could have made better use of this force&mdash;</span><sup class="c4 c16"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael sighed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">These were the people who had been holding off the cryptids for so long. Their usefulness was impeccable, and it would be a shame to lose them here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, there was no room left for negotiation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael&rsquo;s decision to eliminate the traitors and make up the losses was unwavering even in the face of Obera and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That was faster than I expected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera remarked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael responded with a few words of his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your actions were meaningful in that they made me aware of my mistakes. However, you should understand that there is no forgiveness for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Of course, I am not going to ask for your forgiveness.

The front was lined up with defense specialists, and the back rows were constantly attacking as layers were replaced over and over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This made it seem as if it was filled with light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Light converged on Michael from all sides of the hemisphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">An army trained to battle cryptids could function without problems, even at the scale of the entire army. The energy wave offensive, which emphasized efficiency to the utmost, was unleashed continuously even as the troops were replaced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Naturally, there was no way to avoid them, so Michael was directly hit by the concentrated fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But Michael did not panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was because no matter what the attack was, it would be ineffective against the &lsquo;Castle Guard.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;However, there was a problem here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Geh, this&mdash;is this pain?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Castle Guard&rsquo; was supposed to disable all attacks, but for some reason it hadn&rsquo;t done so this time. As a result, the overlapping energy of Obera&rsquo;s concentrated fire burned Michael to a crisp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was an unbelievable event for Michael.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His own body was gradually being damaged. Unperturbed by this, Michael pursued the reason why this happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">&hellip;No energy is reaching the &lsquo;Castle Guard&rsquo;? I see&hellip;apparently, none of them are loyal to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael was convinced that this was the reason, and he was correct. Rudra, with his charisma, had a huge following of Imperial subjects. However, Michael himself did not have any loyal subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was because very few people in the world even knew of Michael&rsquo;s existence, and those few people already had masters of their own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moreover, those masters were only connected by mutual interests, and they did not trust each other, nor had they sworn allegiance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The only exception was Feldway, with whom he was bound by friendship. Moreover, Michael&rsquo;s own Parallel Existence, the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Justice King Michael,&rsquo; had been transferred to him, so they were treated as the same entity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no point in manifesting the power of &lsquo;Castle Guard,&rsquo; using one&rsquo;s own loyalty. That was a very natural logic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">I see, I didn&rsquo;t understand anything about my own skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Surprisingly, people did not understand themselves. In the same way, Michael had been mistaken about &lsquo;Justice King Michael.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Previously, when he had confronted Rimuru&rsquo;s group on the airship, he had thought that he was protecting Feldway with his &lsquo;Castle Guard.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway was Feldway, and he was using his skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unlike back then, Michael could no longer use the loyalty to Rudra. That is why the &lsquo;Castle Guard&rsquo; was ineffective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because this skill nullified all attacks, the conditions for using it must be strict. Michael understood this deeply through his own pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera, the attacker, was also surprised at the unexpected turn of events.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She was aware of Michael&rsquo;s &lsquo;Castle Guard.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She had been told that any attack would be useless, so she was confused to see Michael taking damage. That said, there was no doubt that this was an opportunity, so before she could worry about all that, she gave her orders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Keep on attacking with all of your strength! Keep the coordination smooth, and do not allow Michael to rest!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The soldiers also knew what they were doing and attacked at full force without needing to be told to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera thought to herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael&rsquo;s pursuit was within expectations. There had been a high probability that her betrayal would be discovered when she erased the angelic skill, and she had been prepared to take some sort of action at that point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because she would have definitely done the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a countermeasure for such a case, she planned to launch a full-scale attack, as was being done right now, while continuing to fight a battle of secret withdrawal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The destination of escape was the enemy&rsquo;s territory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She had intended to guide Michael well and hit the cryptids.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, it seemed that this was not currently necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By Obera&rsquo;s perspective, Michael&rsquo;s energy level was several times greater than her own. He appeared to be a formidable fighter, but his combat experience did not seem to be as good as she had expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">Perhaps we can win like this? No, that&rsquo;s too naive. I feel sorry, but some of my soldiers will have to act as decoys in the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera was a cool-headed and brilliant commander.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She was willing to sacrifice her weaker subordinates by dividing her army into numbers. The ability to sacrifice the minority in order to keep the majority alive was also a prerequisite for commanding a large army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is why she could order her subordinates to &lsquo;die&rsquo; without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The selection of who to let live had already been made. If Michael did not make a move, she could teleport out during that opening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that Michael was here, she would be able to open the Great Gate of the Sky from inside the Otherworld.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was with this in mind that Obera, the strategist, set up this escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oma, you will lead the First Legion out of the battlefield. The destination is our Lord, the Demon Lord Milim-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera commanded her loyal followers. She herself intended to stay here and take command until the very end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The First Legion was the most elite of those under Obera. Oma was also an excellent second-in-command, and her fighting skills were outstanding. With the addition of her undead elf body and increased strength, she would be indispensable to Demon Lord Milim in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Believing that, this was Obera&rsquo;s last order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oma did not agree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Oma, who had regained her speech</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;when she became an undead elf</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;herself, asserted fluently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;You must be joking</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c6">.

Even if that were not the case, a warrior could never leave their lord, whom they must protect, just to run away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that said, she smiled quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All the soldiers under Obera&rsquo;s command shouted at the top of their lungs in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Our glory is with you!!&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Without Obera, there was no point in surviving. Those were their true feelings, and their pride.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If Obera had been possessed by &lsquo;Justice King Michael,&rsquo; the absolute &lsquo;Castle Guard&rsquo; would have been manifested. An unbreakable command and a loyal soldier would have been realized, but unfortunately that was only a hypothetical story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You guys&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera was troubled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The worst thing that could happen was that they all died here. At the very least, someone had to reach Milim and inform her of their situation, providing as much information as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">Should I stay? Or should Oma take over?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At this point, feelings were irrelevant. What mattered most was the decision with the highest success rate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera had made her decision and was about to say it when&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All hands, spread out as fast as you can!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She sensed something was wrong and gave the order immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera was deep in thought, but she still kept her attention on Michael, who was under heavy fire. She was not foolish enough to make such a mistake on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why she was had noticed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael&rsquo;s energy had suddenly stopped decreasing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, it meant that he was no longer taking damage, but before she could figure out why, she sensed that Michael was condensing a vast amount of energy. Therefore, she had opened her mouth before she could worry about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Following Obera&rsquo;s orders, hundreds of thousands of troops began to move at once. Since those closer to the outer rim were faster, they tried to spread out in all directions without getting jammed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, as if to ridicule their movements, Michael&rsquo;s technique was activated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a blow that made the power he had gained from capturing Velgrynd completely his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The multi-headed crimson dragon laid waste to Obera&rsquo;s army, and more than ten thousand soldiers perished in that instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was like a scene from a nightmare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But even so, the damage was not as serious as it could have been. If Obera had not noticed, everything would have ended in that instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Y-You</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c1">&hellip;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera was furious that her lovely subordinates were killed, but she remained calm despite her anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She analyzed the current attack and calculated the ratio of strength based on its power. Just from that, she concluded that there was an overwhelming difference between Michael and herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was obvious that if things continued as they were, the worst would come to fruition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, the tens of thousands of scattered rays of light, which had started to counterattack, were being repelled by an ice barrier Michael had put up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">Not only Velgrynd-sama, but perhaps it&rsquo;s also the power of Velzard-sama&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael&rsquo;s body was surrounded by a beautiful blue-white layer of icy diamond dust. It didn&rsquo;t matter that there was no atmosphere in this other world, Michael&rsquo;s aura was generating a supernatural phenomenon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And that power was undoubtedly the &lsquo;Snow Crystal&rsquo; shield of the &lsquo;Frost Dragon&rsquo; Velzard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">An absolute barrier that was said to prevent all attacks. Although it was a defensive technique classified as a physical phenomenon, its nature allowed it to cut off all wavelengths and frequencies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Spiritual attacks could work, but it required an amount of energy comparable to that of Velzard to penetrate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The current Michael was comparable to, or even greater than Velzard. In other words, it would be impossible for Obera alone to shatter &lsquo;Snow Crystal.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the first place, only a few of Obera&rsquo;s subordinates were capable of spiritual attacks like &lsquo;Disintegration.&rsquo; Even if she were to unite the power of all the survivors and launch Disintegration, it was unlikely that it would even reach Michael.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oma, I am entrusting the mission to you. Escape from here. And to Milim-sama&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I cannot accept that.

For the time being, I decided that it would be best if we all went together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By the way, was there another battlefield out here? There was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I could sense a thick magical residue near the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But&hellip;my instinctive intuition told me to ignore it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Why was that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Without any reason or evidence, I decided to follow it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, now was not the time to be troubled, so I decided to take immediate action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Everyone seemed to have no objection, and we all began moving towards the castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The visibility was terrible. I was doing my best to activate &lsquo;Universal Perception,&rsquo; but I couldn&rsquo;t even get a sense of distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The reason was simple&mdash;Velzard&rsquo;s snowstorm was contaminated with magicules. That&rsquo;s why the &lsquo;Natural Effects Nullification&rsquo; was disabled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As long as we were sensing distance using the reflection of magicules in the atmosphere, everything would become ambiguous if the space was filled with magicules.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, all we could do was to move in the direction where the magicules were shaking. That ended up being the correct answer, and we soon reached Leon&rsquo;s castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The inside of the castle was better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was relieved to have my sight back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, I looked for signs of battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ve detected a sign of Leon.

The energy was so intense that it exceeded my current full power, and I decided that this would be dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The scene at the end of the transport was a true race against time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I performed &lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo; at several hundred million times the speed and tried to read the situation&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Laplace and Teare were protecting a woman, led by Yuuki, who had summoned up the last of his energy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The woman looked familiar to me. Yuuki&rsquo;s secretary&mdash;she must have been the possessed form of the Demon Lord Kazalim. Her name was Kagali, and the last time I saw her, she had been under the control of Lieutenant Kondo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t know what had happened to her, but she seemed to have regained her free will. No, the current problem was not that, but rather the gigantic fireball that the enemy was about to unleash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Strengthened by an ultimate skill, its heat and destructive power had been increased to such an extent that it could shatter even the spirit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, it would even destroy the soul.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And it had already been unleashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I would be safe. My &lsquo;Void God (Azathoth)&rsquo; could eat up the power of destruction, so I was well protected against the release.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Naturally, Benimaru was also under its influence, so there was no need to worry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Yuuki and the others, who were exposed to the gigantic fireball and took the direct hit from the front, had already been damaged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then, they were already&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;No. If you eat them with &lsquo;Void God (Azathoth),&rsquo; or&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Do it!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Before I could even finish listening to the entire explanation, I gave the order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In no time at all, Ciel-san took action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet, however&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The result was a huge explosion that blew away the castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yuuki was swallowed up by the light and disappeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so did Laplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The large explosion that distorted space was largely suppressed by my power.

Of course, that meant that the backwards-compatible &lsquo;Melt Slash&rsquo; would be useless as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In that case, one might think that slashing at the body would be enough, but this was not so easy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because this Feldway guy was quite skilled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I crossed swords with him, I felt that Feldway&rsquo;s abilities were considerable.

I&rsquo;d say that he was on par with Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since I had become a True Dragon race, my physical abilities had increased greatly. It was not a metaphor, but I was now able to move several times faster than before. In addition, I thought that my skill with the sword had also improved, but I still couldn&rsquo;t get to Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In my case, I was able to deal with it because I had been cheating in many ways and could even ask Ciel-san to take my place if I had to, but I really felt that I had no chance in a fair and serious fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In such a situation, the best thing to do was to switch to using magic attacks, which swords could not receive. However, large-scale magic would cause a lot of damage to Leon&rsquo;s kingdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, the only other option was to use magic for individuals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Abyss Annihilation&rsquo; that I just mentioned had a destructive power that could affect the entire planet, so it couldn&rsquo;t be used anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, I used it as an example because it was one the highest classes of magic in terms of power. When it came to anti-personnel magic, I couldn&rsquo;t really think of anything that could surpass it. &lsquo;Disintegration&rsquo; was barely comparable to it, and anything else would just be guessing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The simple anti-personnel nuclear magic: Nuclear Cannon, was not nearly as powerful as Disintegration&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even if an ultimate skill was used to increase the power, it could be dealt with if the opponent also had an ultimate skill. Even without it, there was no way to make it hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fortunately, Feldway was keeping a wait-and-see attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he started to fight back, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to afford it. At the moment, it seemed that the best thing to do was to try to find a way out of the situation through conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I started talking so as not to let him know how irritated I was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a harmless slime.

However, the same was true for Feldway who was not receiving damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway seemed to be defending himself with some kind of skill, but since he was only defending himself, the fatigue appeared to be minor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One strategy was to use a sword technique that Feldway could not catch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To be perfectly honest, I had another secret technique up my sleeve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was an improved version of Benimaru and Carrera&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hyakka Ryouran,&rdquo; and could not be used without Ciel-san&rsquo;s full support.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was hesitant to use it because it was a technique that exceeded my current skill-level and made me feel like I was cheating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But now was not the time for such things, and I considered using it when the opportunity presented itself&mdash;but I just couldn&rsquo;t picture it succeeding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was something ominous about it all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It seemed that Ciel-san agreed with me, and I decided to give priority to finding out Feldway&rsquo;s secrets for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">That&rsquo;s why we were currently in an indefinite battle</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c1">, but when I thought about it more deeply, it was also a good time to calmly check the other battle situations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was also concerned about the safety of the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While keeping my eyes on Feldway, I focused on my friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Benimaru was the one I was worried about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His opponent seemed superior in all aspects, so I tried to observe the situation with &lsquo;Universal Perception&rsquo; without looking at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hm?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jahil was wielding a ghastly blood-colored spear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had no idea when or from where he brought it out, but I could feel a tremendous power coming from that spear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&laquo;It seems that the spear is called the Origin Blood Spear. </span><span class="c6 c16">&ldquo;This spear, given to me by the Divine Ancestor, will pierce you through!&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he said.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">O-Oh, I see&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unlike me, it seemed that Ciel-san was already aware of Benimaru&rsquo;s situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, it&rsquo;s true that we couldn&rsquo;t be too careful, but we weren&rsquo;t necessarily in a bad situation.

In any case, I wanted to aim for a more effective timing, but right now didn&rsquo;t seem to be the right time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The situation was severe, but we were still in equilibrium. I felt that if I overreacted now, I might end up putting us all in danger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I would continue to wait and see about Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I was making such a decision, I received a complaint from Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, I understand that you can afford to do so, but I&rsquo;m in a really difficult spot here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How unusual, for Benimaru to be complaining&mdash;well, I guess it was understandable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A power difference of more than four times was too severe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really bad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was fortunate that Jahil specialized in flames because it gave Benimaru an advantage in terms of compatibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He would have been defeated long ago otherwise, so even the current situation was miraculous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now then, what to do&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The battle would be decided once the equilibrium was broken, but even I didn&rsquo;t have the strength to do so.

However, their opponent, Vega, had an existence value of more than ten million, and the difference in their abilities was too great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Misora, the Duke-class commander, was very talented as Raine&rsquo;s second-in-command. She was always looking after Raine, who tended to slack off, and she possessed a broad perspective with good leadership.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But even so, there was no room for effective leadership when some of them had been crippled by Vega&rsquo;s attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In spite of this, the battle line did not collapse thanks to Misora&rsquo;s efforts. And it was Maetel&rsquo;s restoration magic that desperately supported this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Normally, these proud demons were very individualistic, but with the cooperation of all five of them, they managed to maintain the front line, even making full use of illusion magic to deceive. However, when Ulrich and Alban fell at the same time, the burden on those who remained increased. Maetel&rsquo;s recovery magic could not keep up, and total annihilation was imminent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was at this critical moment that Ranga intervened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What the hell, you dog! You dare to interfere with me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega was on a high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that he had so much power, he believed himself to be invincible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why he decided that one more monster wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was a mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ranga&rsquo;s existence value was less than half of Vega&rsquo;s, but his combat experience was not to be underestimated. Because he was always lurking in Rimuru&rsquo;s shadow, he had witnessed many battles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is why Ranga was able to flexibly adapt his tactics to the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This time, the strategic victory would be to get through this without any casualties. By understanding that, his role became more clear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Use me as a shield and regroup. Reinforcements will definitely come. My lord will not be defeated!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wagging his tail, Ranga assured them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that alone, Misora and the others understood that Rimuru had arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Misora accurately read Ranga&rsquo;s intentions and figured out what the best course of action would be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I shall take your word for it. Maetel-dono, please concentrate on Ranga-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And with that, the tactics were swiftly rearranged, and the battle changed with Ranga as the focal point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From this point on, Vega&rsquo;s high would come to an end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was because Ranga, whom Vega had initially dismissed as inferior, performed better than expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Without thinking, Vega attempted to eliminate Ranga. By using his Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka&rsquo; to the fullest extent, he tried to subdue him with pure power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Ultimate Skill, &lsquo;Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka,&rsquo; was a skill acquired after Vega&rsquo;s upbringing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega was descended from the &ldquo;magical inquisitors,&rdquo; one of the Rosso&rsquo;s research achievements. He was a monster that possessed both monster and human characteristics, and could recover from any injury as long as he was fed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">It was a secret that Yuuki had modified him to become a kind of imitation slime</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega&rsquo;s whole body was a collection of miniscule magical bacteria. Therefore, he could regenerate freely, and as long as a single part of his body remained, he could be revived without any problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was able to mimic the structure of living organisms, and depending on the probability, he could even acquire the Skill of the opponent after Predation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was precisely because of this that Vega was able to acquire the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The true value of this skill was that it absorbed the power of the eaten target, just like the Vega&rsquo;s essential nature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a power very similar to Rimuru&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth,&rsquo; and was an aggregation of terrifying abilities such as &lsquo;Ultraspeed Thought,&rsquo; &lsquo;Parallel Thought,&rsquo; &lsquo;Analyze and Assess,&rsquo; &lsquo;Organic Domination,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mass Reproduction,&rsquo; &lsquo;Skill Absorption,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Multilayer Barrier.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It had an extremely high performance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If the victim had a physical body, it&rsquo;s information could be read using &lsquo;Organic Domination&rsquo; and its racial abilities could be acquired.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even if the victim was a spiritual life form, it was possible to steal away its energy using &lsquo;Skill Absorption&rsquo; and even make its Skills their own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On top of that, as long as there was an organic body to use as a material, the user could mass-produce and manipulate &lsquo;replicas&rsquo; of themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka&rsquo; was a skill that, if it could be mastered, could help the wielder become as strong as they wished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If it could be mastered&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, Vega hadn&rsquo;t had that much experience since he was born.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had grown at an alarming rate, and his power had only increased, but he had yet to master his own powers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega could only use &lsquo;Organic Domination&rsquo; to strengthen his body, &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; to understand his enemies&rsquo; weaknesses, and &lsquo;Skill Absorption&rsquo; to weaken his enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He also used &lsquo;Ultraspeed Thought&rsquo; unconsciously, so he was able to make good decisions, but unfortunately, he could not use &lsquo;Parallel Thinking,&rsquo; and was unable to claim victory despite having an overwhelming advantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Vega himself was enjoying his strength so much that he didn&rsquo;t even realize that he had missed his best chance&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;And with a vicious power, Vega&rsquo;s fist pierced through Ranga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Hm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega wondered at the lack of response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He should have pierced through him, but he couldn&rsquo;t feel anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Let alone stealing energy, he could not even use &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; on the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The reason for this was that Ranga was using his own abilities to the fullest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Ranga&rsquo;s ultimate skill, &lsquo;Stellar Wind King Hastur,&rsquo; had the effect of transforming his body into a magical</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;wind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Physical attacks would not work against Ranga, who had turned into a terrifying &ldquo;demonic wind&rdquo; that contaminated everything it touched. In fact, the moment something touched Ranga, it would be damaged by the &ldquo;death-calling wind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The current Ranga was magic itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The logic was the same as that of Karion&rsquo;s Burst Roar; He maintained his regular form and mass but was transformed into a willful particle of destructive energy not unlike a spiritual life form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even a simple physical attack would become an attack of great destructive power. One did not need an explanation to understand how terrifying this was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Furthermore, unlike with Karion, this was not Ranga using a special move, but rather undergoing a change in state. Naturally, the rate of energy consumption would be higher, but there would be no restrictions placed on him just for entering a &ldquo;magical wind&rdquo; state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was the power of someone who could utilize their Skill to the fullest extent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although Vega was superior in terms of existence value, Ranga was the winner in terms of ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, that fist doesn&rsquo;t seem to work on me, does it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Actually, Ranga was surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had expected Vega to be stronger and had been wary of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because Rimuru was always so cautious, Ranga learned to imitate him. That is why he never let his guard down against Vega, who possessed more than twice the amount of energy as he did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the contrary, he even suspected that this was a trap of some kind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn you! You have no respect even though you&rsquo;re just a dog!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And after Vega tried to hit him, he realized for the first time that the other party was an idiot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he had hit Ranga, who had turned into magical wind, without thinking, the result would have been the same as hurting himself. Vega would have taken the damage on his own, and Ranga was left dumbfounded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this case, the correct answer was to wrap your fist in a skill-enhanced aura and then hit him. The same applied to attacking with weapons. Skills could only be dealt with by skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he was a spiritual life form, he could be as effective as an ultimate skill by increasing his energy, but Vega did not take any of that into consideration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he had mastered his Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka,&rsquo; he would not have shown such a disgraceful appearance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You fool. I thought you were playing a trick on me, but it looks like you were actually serious. In that case, I shall make my move at once.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as Ranga announced this, he began to run at full speed. He became a jet-black wind that tossed Vega around, leaving the sound behind and filling the space with afterimages from the earth to the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then, it became a howling that reverberated inside the space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Ranga amplified his own speed and destructive power through the &lsquo;Sound and Wind Domination&rsquo; of the &lsquo;Stellar Wind King Hastur,&rsquo; and then created a force field using &lsquo;Spatial Domination&rsquo; while running at full speed. After that, he created a &lsquo;Death Storm</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span class="c6">&rsquo; within the force field by using &lsquo;Weather Domination&rsquo; for the final blow&mdash;this eventually lead to the &lsquo;Apocalypse</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rsquo; that destroyed everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">This technique was called &lsquo;Apocalypse Howling.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was the most powerful individual attack technique that Ranga had devised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, if one made a howling roar, they could also fire it as a directional beam. Normally, that would be the simpler and more correct way to use it. However, if one wanted to cause more damage, it was better to use a beam that was confined to a certain space, as was the case in this situation. By confining the target, there was no waste of energy, so a greater effect was to be expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega took a direct hit from this, but surprisingly, he survived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although he was not able to use the &lsquo;Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka&rsquo; properly, he was still subconsciously affected by the skill in his body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Moreover, Vega could be characterized by his stubbornness</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt38" id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although he was not left unharmed, he was able to regenerate his own body in time before being killed by activating &lsquo;Organic Domination&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mass Reproduction.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His magicule count was not to be underestimated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega took a deep breath and bellowed with all his might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shit, shit, shiiiiiiit&hellip;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then he glared at Ranga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega took a deep breath to calm himself down, and then spat out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it! It&rsquo;s been a long series of continuous battles, and it looks like I&rsquo;m tired too. I&rsquo;ll call it a draw for today, so prepare yourself for the next time we meet! See ya.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega&rsquo;s cowardice was the only reason why he was so good at sensing danger. Realizing that the situation had become disadvantageous for him, he immediately decided to run away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ranga had no objections.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From the fact that he had withstood his own strongest move, he could see that Vega was superior to him in terms of existence value. He understood that he could not defeat Vega unless he was able to finish him off with that current blow. In that case, there was no need to push himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His tactical goal was to buy time, so if he could force Vega to retreat, then that would be considered a success. Therefore, Ranga&rsquo;s decision to not engage Vega was the correct choice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus, the battle against Vega, the fiercest of the battlefields, came to an end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now then, everyone was pleased by Ranga&rsquo;s support, however&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Misora thought to herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">This Ranga fellow is the pet of the Demon Lord Rimuru-sama, isn&rsquo;t he? So then why is he so strong?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That strength was just illogical.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Misora had a rough idea of how large or small Vega and Ranga&rsquo;s energy values were. This was because a good fighter could not survive if they were unable to measure the strength of their enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In Misora&rsquo;s perspective, Ranga was a serious contender, but Vega still seemed to be a more formidable opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet, Ranga had been the overwhelming victor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She had planned to use Ranga as a shield and reconfigure her tactics, but now she felt like she had been let down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">&ldquo;You know, Misora, there are some extraordinary beings in this world. Once you take a good look at Rimuru-sama, you will understand how I feel right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Misora remembered the words of her boss (Raine).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see now&hellip;just by watching his pet, one can understand the caliber of the owner. I did not doubt Raine-sama&rsquo;s words, but now I understand them wholeheartedly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Misora couldn&rsquo;t help muttering, and the four remaining demon peers nodded their heads in total agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And White Knight Maetel, who had almost run out of mana, was left dumbfounded that he had no part to play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was as if they had escaped reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">I like dogs, and I&rsquo;ve always wanted to have one. They&rsquo;re just so dependable. After this battle, I&rsquo;ll have to rush to the pet store to buy one!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a complete abandonment of thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By the way, pet stores in this world did not sell pet dogs. They sold animals and monsters that were trained by a tamer and could really fight, at a high price.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Later on, Maetel would buy a forest wolf and give it the name &lsquo;Ranga II,&rsquo; but that was another story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Red Knight Fran and Yellow Knight Kizona were struggling against Oria.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The word &ldquo;struggling&rdquo; was an understatement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If Oria had seriously intended to kill them, the battle would have instantly been decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuh, she&rsquo;s just too strong&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fran muttered, biting her lip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kizona, who was exposed to Oria&rsquo;s attack, agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just toying with us. Now it&rsquo;s a mace? It was a short-sword earlier, but she&rsquo;s making the weapons weaker and weaker, testing their performance on us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kizona&rsquo;s point was correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">At first, Oria was holding a morning star.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With one blow, Kizona&rsquo;s full body armor had been shattered. The next blow would have killed her, but Oria&rsquo;s next move was to switch weapons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kizona felt as if she was being taken for a fool, but it was also true that she felt lucky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgraceful to be ridiculed like this, but I guess it can&rsquo;t be helped since there&rsquo;s such a large difference between our abilities&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s think positively. If we keep stalling for time, I am sure that Leon-sama will come to help!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fran and Kizona were determined to not give up and face Oria with an unrealistic hope. They both understood that such hope was an illusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Their master, Demon Lord Leon, must be in an even more treacherous situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Otherwise, Leon would not have abandoned his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, all they could do was try to stay alive until help arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was long overdue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The disparity in their abilities was too great. Not even ten minutes had passed since the battle had started, and they were already wounded to the bone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And Oria was also satisfied after testing her abilities to some extent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Is that enough?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oria spoke and transformed her weapon into the &lsquo;Trident.&rsquo; It was the main weapon of a woman who had once been named Orca.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fran and Kizona also understood that Oria&rsquo;s presence had changed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">So this is it&hellip;I did my best, but I regret that I couldn&rsquo;t complete my mission&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fran was despairing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kizona was more materialistic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">I wish I could have eaten some cake in the end&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They waited for everything to end while thinking to themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, the end never came.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Instead, what came was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You seem to be in some trouble. I thought it would be tactless of me to intervene, but I will leave that matter to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kumara, who had transformed herself into a beautiful woman, stood before Oria as if to protect Fran and Kizona.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus, the battle between Kumara and Oria began, and once again, it was a one-sided affair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But this time, it was Oria who was completely outmatched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way, why?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A startled cry escaped Oria&rsquo;s mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oria&rsquo;s Ultimate Enchantment, &lsquo;Multiple Weapons,&rsquo; was the power to create mythical-grade weapons of any performance. The full-body armor she wore was also mythical-grade, as it should be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet, the nine-tailed punches that Kumara was unleashing by manipulating her tails were damaging Oria without any regard to her mythical-grade armor. It did not shatter the armor, but the impact still penetrated and reduced Oria&rsquo;s physical strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty weak, aren&rsquo;t you? If that&rsquo;s the case, I don&rsquo;t need to send out the Eight Legions</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt40" id="ftnt_ref40">[40]</a></sup><span class="c1">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kumara had wondered if she should send out a Tailed Beast to gauge the enemy&rsquo;s strength, but after one battle, she had decided that there was no need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oria was a top-notch warrior and a formidable opponent who could even control advanced magic. However, her movements did not deviate from the realm of human beings, and she did not stray from Kumara&rsquo;s expectations in any way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For Kumara, who had experience with strong opponents such as Karion and Frey, this opponent was unsatisfactory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Oria&rsquo;s armament that should be of concern, but that too was not a threat to Kumara.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because Kumara had evolved even further.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">From a Nine Tails to a Fox Djinn.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt41" id="ftnt_ref41">[41]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kumara&rsquo;s power had increased greatly once she took on divinity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of course, Oria had a seraph in her, so she also had divinity. Moreover, when comparing the existence values between them, there was not much of a difference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kumara had grown a little, but still had an existence value of less than 2 million, while Oria had an existence value of a little more than 2 million. By numerical values alone, Oria had the advantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oria, with only her experience as a human, had too narrow of a range of uses for her power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">When they were humans, Oria&mdash;Orca and Aria</span><span class="c6 c16">&mdash;</span><span class="c1">had been the most senior executive members of the Mixed Corps under Yuuki. They had been as strong as the Imperial Knights, the most powerful group in the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The souls of these two women mingled and awakened as undead elves, and even gained the power of the seraphim. On top of that, the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative,&rsquo; given to them by Michael, had been transformed into &lsquo;Multiple Weapons.&rsquo; She was convinced that there were no enemies worth noting on earth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After experimenting with Fran and Kizona to confirm this, Oria was convinced that her power was the strongest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The weapons created by her skill were second to none for any existing mythical-grade equipment. As proof of this, Fran&rsquo;s and Kizona&rsquo;s attacks had not worked on Oria at all. They couldn&rsquo;t even touch her body, and the two had been repelled by her mythical-grade armor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her weapon could shatter the enemy&rsquo;s weapon with only a light swing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oria had become overconfident in her own power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was why she refused to acknowledge the current reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do not take me for a fool! I&rsquo;ll be getting serious from here on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that the experimenting was over, Oria swung her &lsquo;Trident&rsquo; around with all the skill she possessed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The magic that Aria had been so good at transformed into a purple light. Even Kumara would have been mortally wounded if she were to be hit by the spear that Orca was unleashing with her brilliant skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nine tails, cloaked in a divine aura, moved freely to block the &lsquo;Trident.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At this point, the difference in ability was obvious to everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just as it was natural for people to differ in power even when they had the same physical abilities, there was a difference between those who had studied martial arts and those who were still amateurs&mdash;perhaps even greater than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even Fran and Kizona, who had only been watching the fight between the two women, could clearly see the difference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s amazing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, is that person one of Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinates?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure she&rsquo;s on our side.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How should I put this&hellip;I think I&rsquo;ve come to realize that we should never become enemies. I mean, even the people we don&rsquo;t know about are so powerful&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up. I agree with you even if you don&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were admiring Kumara&rsquo;s brave figure while talking about her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kumara, the bewitching beauty herself, was standing gracefully without moving an inch. Once one realized this fact, it was like being shown that there was not any point in arguing about who was better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, are you ready?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kumara asked, her smile deepening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t accept this. That&rsquo;s right, I won&rsquo;t. I&mdash;we have acquired the strongest power. This power exists only to serve the great Michael-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, I see. But it won&rsquo;t work on me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kumara ruthlessly replied to the angry Oria.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was an obvious fact, but it was still enough of an insult to make Oria angry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly! I am Oria, the one who defeats Michael-sama&rsquo;s enemies!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oria took pride in herself and attacked Kumara with all her might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was just reckless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A suicide attack without a plan was nothing but a meaningless attack to Kumara.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oria&rsquo;s spear was flicked away by Kumara&rsquo;s tail, and her limbs were restrained by four tails.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The dull sound of shattering joints echoed through the air&mdash;A merciless ending for Oria.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My &ldquo;name&rdquo; is Kumara. Kumara the &ldquo;Chimera Lord.&rdquo; Receive this as a souvenir for the dead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kumara finally announced her name as she slammed her tails into the immobilized Oria.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios had mastered the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Punishment King Sandalphon&rsquo; and was overwhelming the Blue Knight Oxian and Mizeri&rsquo;s lieutenant, Kahn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">The bastard sword</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt42" id="ftnt_ref42">[42]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;that Arios held was also a mythical-grade sword borrowed from Oria. He had grown in strength and power beyond what he could have ever imagined as a human.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why Arios had put off killing them. The two inferiors were just the right playmates for him to test his strength on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Both Oria and Arios knew that it was not an honorable thing for the strong to bully the weak. Unlike Vega, both of them had common sense and would not normally get involved in personal affairs in the middle of a mission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But this time, the situation was different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They both believed that if they didn&rsquo;t test out their powers, which was very different from what they were used to, it would be a hindrance to their future battles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was also a necessary task for a first-class warrior to grasp what they could do and to what extent they could push themselves. Therefore, he had taken this opportunity to allow himself a certain amount of play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oxian and Kahn were aware of Arios&rsquo; intentions. It was humiliating for the two proud men, but this time it was convenient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The victory condition was to buy time, and it was difficult for them to achieve that with their abilities alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, even though they knew they were being toyed with, they had no choice but to face Arios desperately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Aside from the intelligent Oxian, the old demon, Kahn, was boiling like magma on the inside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">I&rsquo;ll kill him. I&rsquo;ll never forgive him!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kahn was the leader of Mizeri&rsquo;s subordinates and was normally a calm and collected person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, his patience was not as strong as Misora&rsquo;s. He was always in awe of his colleagues, wondering how they could endure under someone like Raine-sama.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So now, after being humiliated like this, Kahn&rsquo;s fury was at an all-time high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, there was still a cruel wall between him and Arios.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was not so much a difference in skill-level. In fact, Oxian and Kahn were probably better than him in that aspect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But even so, the reason why it was so one-sided was that there was a large gap between their existence values by several times. Moreover, Arios possessed the fearsome &lsquo;Punishment King Sandalphon.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Aside from a mythical-grade weapon, nothing could even compete with the ultimate skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It had been a long and painful time, but that was coming to an end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They could tell from Arios&rsquo; expression that his stance had shifted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh, that&rsquo;s enough. You guys were pretty strong, right? Well, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun, so I&rsquo;ll kill you easily without causing you any more pain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Having tested his strength enough, Arios must have decided that it was time to stop fooling around. He told Kahn and Oxian as such.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was nothing they could do about it, Oxian had decided.<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">I will have to leave the rest to Leon-sama. I shall apologize in the afterlife for being unable to complete my mission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oxian apologized inwardly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kahn, too, etched anger into his soul.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Even if I die here, I will never forget my grudge. Arios&mdash;I will remember that name. I will definitely come back one day and kill you!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For a demon, death was merely a change of state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As long as the core was left intact, they could be revived over time. Depending on the amount of damage, it might take hundreds of years or more, but no matter what, they could always be revived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is why Kahn swore to take revenge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, it was necessary to interfere with the spirit in order to damage the mind. As represented by &ldquo;Disintegration,&rdquo; the &ldquo;information particles&rdquo; could not be reached without destroying the spirit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that Arios had the &lsquo;Punishment King Sandalphon,&rsquo; he should be able to destroy the core if he was aware of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Kahn was not so worried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios&rsquo; swordsmanship, physical ability, and Skill were all first-rate, but his spirit did not deviate from that of humans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t seem to have much experience in dealing with non-humans, and he didn&rsquo;t seem to know how to deal with demons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was why Kahn believed that he could get out of this situation by pretending to be dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios&rsquo; sword was held up to Oxian, and the gun in his hand was pointed at Kahn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kahn&rsquo;s body was already at its limit. Now that Arios was serious, there was no way he would be able to continue fighting any longer. Although he felt bad for Oxian, Kahn&rsquo;s strength was his ability to keep a cool head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">So this is it for now. I&rsquo;ll have to successfully withdraw&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As Kahn was thinking this, Arios took one look at Kahn with a broad smile and put his finger on the trigger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hyahaha! I&rsquo;ll start with you first&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;The best I can do is smile for now&rsquo;&mdash;Kahn thought, but then his eyes widened as something caught his eye.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Behind Arios, someone jumped out from the shadows at his feet and swung a sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At this point, the crisis was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kahn recognized this person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He remembered that he was a subordinate of the Demon Lord Rimuru, and that he had called himself Souei.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oxian also noticed him at about the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Souei-dono, so the reinforcements arrived in time?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oxian shouted with joy, to which Souei replied bitterly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn, I thought that I&rsquo;d kill him with one blow, but I guess that was a little naive. He&rsquo;s still alive, so don&rsquo;t let your guard down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although Souei was a gentleman in front of Rimuru, he was more of a self-confident and self-centered person at heart. Aside from perhaps the head of state of another nation, he would never defer to a senior executive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In addition, this was an emergency, so he had taken the initiative to take control of the situation, placing Oxian and Kahn under his command.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, Arios, who had been suddenly ambushed, was still alive as Souei had said. He was coughing up blood, but somehow still managed to regain his position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Arios had just barely noticed the deadly blow from his blind spot that also carried Souei&rsquo;s &lsquo;Insta-kill&rsquo; ability&mdash;&lsquo;Assassinate</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt43" id="ftnt_ref43">[43]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rsquo;&mdash;he narrowly avoided the attack that would have pierced his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bastard, now you&rsquo;ve really done it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your reaction time is impressive. However, I won&rsquo;t miss the next time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s all that was said before they rushed into battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios was arrogant, but he still had a cautious personality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Before being reborn as a Y&#333;ten (Heavenly Demon/Spirit)</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt44" id="ftnt_ref44">[44]</a></sup><span class="c1">, he had been a powerful otherworlder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had been involved in assassination missions and had learned all kinds of skills. He was an expert in interpersonal warfare and had learned all the manner of ways to be careful when being targeted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is why he never let his guard down under any circumstances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even while he hunted down Oxian and Kahn, he had not neglected being vigilant to his surroundings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was what saved his life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was all it did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, so your strength is greater than mine. That&rsquo;ll be tough to beat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what will you do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A battle of competing forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And a fight for one&rsquo;s life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios felt that he was very much alive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Already, his injuries had healed. His life force had been strengthened to an extraordinary degree, and he now possessed the power of the seraphim. It was just that he still hadn&rsquo;t broken free from the conventions of being human, but Arios has long since entered the realm of the non-human.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">With this power that surpasses even a demon lord, no matter who you are, you&rsquo;re no match for me!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was proud of himself and looked forward to Souei&rsquo;s next move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios was already aware. As Souei had said, he was more powerful than him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He did not doubt his victory, as he felt that he was not that far behind in terms of skill-level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He did not let his guard down&mdash;However, he was much too arrogant in dealing with Souei.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From the very start, Souei had not intended to compete with Arios.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The battle must be won.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No matter how good the battle was, a loss was game over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is why Souei did not care about how he won.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From the very beginning, he had kept his &lsquo;split body&rsquo; hidden and watched for Arios&rsquo; to leave an opening. In this way, while fighting a close battle, he gradually made Arios feel that he was going to lose, so that Arios would be caught off guard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While making it seem like he was doing his best, he stripped away at Arios&rsquo; moves one by one, and built a solid path to victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then came the decisive moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hyahaha! You&rsquo;ve been a tough opponent. I&rsquo;ll give you that. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll kill you with my best move!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that said, he unleashed &lsquo;Judgment,&rsquo; the sure-kill move of the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Punishment King Sandalphon.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It pierced right through, and Souei&rsquo;s &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; fizzled out. Seeing this, Arios was convinced that he had won.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was understandable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Judgment could only be fired once a day, but it was the strongest means of attack. It was less powerful than the one that Lieutenant Kondou had fired, but it was still a blow that could not be broken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was understandable that he believed Souei&rsquo;s death to be certain, but that was exactly what Souei was waiting for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Thousand-Hand Shadow Kill.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wa&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A shadow stretched out and grabbed Arios.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-Wait!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Souei blocked Arios&rsquo; movements and pierced through his heart with the twin swords in his hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Feldway&rsquo;s words that changed the stalemated situation of the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;It&rsquo;s about time to move on. It appears that further battles are meaningless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I heard that, I thought to myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I should have made my decision sooner.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If I could corner him here, that would be the best. But unfortunately, I felt that we were at a disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If we continued fighting like this, I was pretty sure that we would get support, but to be perfectly honest, I wasn&rsquo;t certain. Ranga and the others wouldn&rsquo;t lose, but I couldn&rsquo;t deny the possibility that we were being too optimistic. There was a hint of danger in the castle, so I was worried that they might be struggling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Basically, I only wanted to fight battles that I could definitely win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But this time, I had not been prepared enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t anticipate that even the communications would be cut off, and I had come to the battlefield without properly analyzing the enemy&rsquo;s strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had a few expectations because of Dino&rsquo;s report, but when we actually fought, I found that the enemy forces were much stronger than expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For Jahil to overwhelm Benimaru as he did was a foul play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had been expecting Benimaru to quickly defeat the enemy as usual. And yet, the situation had been so unbelievable that it was even a wonder that he hadn&rsquo;t been defeated&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, if he was going to retreat here, I had no intention of stopping him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had no intention of stopping him&mdash;but I would not forget to fan the flames as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoa, you&rsquo;re not thinking of running away now, are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Silvia-san, who was dealing with Leon, turned her attention away from him when she heard that. She was glaring at me as if to tell me to mind my own business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Unlike El-tan, she wasn&rsquo;t proficient in conversational implicature.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For this kind of thing, the one who hides their true intentions is the winner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In times of distress, the rule is to deceive your opponent by saying the opposite.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, I&rsquo;ve accomplished my goal of bringing Leon, the owner of the &lsquo;Purity King Metatron,&rsquo; into the fold, and I&rsquo;ve also identified and eliminated the traitor in my way. On top of that, I was able to determine the extent of your abilities. It&rsquo;s a good result overall.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hmm, as expected, he didn&rsquo;t take this kind of gossip lying down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was the main purpose, wasn&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By saying something pitiful, the other party will feel good about retreating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For me, it would be more annoying to hear them say something like, &ldquo;yeah, I quit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">So, while thinking </span><span class="c6 c16">&ldquo;go home, go home, hurry up and go home!&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on the inside, I continued to urge Feldway on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re scared, huh? Well, my people will be coming for you soon. Once they do, we&rsquo;ll win, so I can understand why you&rsquo;d want to run!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While saying that, I launched a fierce attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perhaps my words had upset him a little, but Feldway&rsquo;s sword slowed for a moment. I felt my sword graze his body, but Feldway was unharmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Was I mistaken?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, no, I feel like I had grazed him a few times before&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As Noir&rsquo;s master, you sure are a cocky little bastard. The next time I see you, I&rsquo;ll crush you with a desperate fighting power, so be prepared.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my line! Since you seem to have such an issue with Diablo, I&rsquo;ll let him deal with you next time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I spat out a line, sounding as if I came straight out of some crappy manga, Feldway looked mortified. I didn&rsquo;t miss the look of disgust on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was the secret technique, &ldquo;leave it to someone else!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, it worked so well this time that I was planning to force it on Diablo even if he didn&rsquo;t like it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, reading the atmosphere and observing other peoples&rsquo; reactions are essential skills for working people. If you watch people carefully, you will eventually learn what makes them happy and what makes them uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On top of that experience, I had previously worked for over ten years in the construction industry, where socializing was very important, and I was very good at harassing people like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was obvious from Feldway&rsquo;s behavior that he had a problem with Diablo. I thought that I might be mistaken, but I was relieved to see that I was correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You really are a jerk, you bastard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am honored by your praise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Damn it, you really are getting carried away. Jahil, Leon, we&rsquo;re leaving.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway escaped from the argument with me and announced his retreat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A victory in spirit&mdash;that was a joke, but this was, in fact, a tactical victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to settle this here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah. It&rsquo;s a command from Michael-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Well, that&rsquo;s fine. I owe you a debt of gratitude. My body doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in the best of shape, so I&rsquo;ll just do as I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jahil had overwhelmed Benimaru, but he grudgingly agreed. To be perfectly honest, I thought it would be troublesome if he had insisted on continuing, so I felt relieved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or at least I did&mdash;Benimaru then started to agitate Jahil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, are you running away? I almost had the chance to win, but it was my inexperience that stopped me from finishing you off. I&rsquo;ll win next time though, you can be sure of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I wondered what in the world he was doing, but I couldn&rsquo;t complain since I was the one who started this in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;What the hell is wrong with you guys?&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Silvia-san&rsquo;s painful glare seemed to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I could understand that feeling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From a third person&rsquo;s point of view, I would have thought that we were idiots, too&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know your place in the world, you worm!! If you continue to taunt me, the Great Magician, then I&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jahil, that&rsquo;s the slime&rsquo;s right-hand man. If you lose your composure, then you&rsquo;ll lose a battle you should be able to win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thank you for that misunderstanding!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">I think he misunderstood by a spoonful or two</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt47" id="ftnt_ref47">[47]</a></sup><span class="c1">, but if he took things that way, I was happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For the very first time, I felt that Feldway might be a decent guy. It was probably due to my usual demeanor, but I think I was successful in making him more cautious than necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;that&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ll allow this bastard to save face this time. There won&rsquo;t be a next time, you brats.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jahil seemed short-tempered, but he was surprisingly thoughtful. He had been all ready to go on another rampage, but he followed Feldway&rsquo;s lead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And Leon, being manipulated as he was, did not argue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Having reached a consensus, the three of them flew away from the broken ceiling and into the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After seeing them off, Benimaru and I sat down on the spot, our strength gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I personally thought that it was better to be aggressive in a fight, but this time I had gone too far. I would have to be more careful next time, or it might have the opposite effect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just as I was thinking about this, Benimaru turned to me, exhausted and complaining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, it was too dangerous to stir things up in that situation!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was full of pent-up emotions that should have been said earlier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have no right to say that! We were just about to settle things, but then you goaded Jahil, and I was left wondering what was going on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I was just following Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s lead. If my lord is not ready to retreat, then I cannot pull the plug myself. Besides, well, I&rsquo;d feel like I lost if I didn&rsquo;t do so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I saw Benimaru&rsquo;s nice smile, I felt like I was seeing his real intention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I noticed Silvia-san staring at us with a dumbfounded expression, but Benimaru and I just acted as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega, who escaped from Ranga, did not think that he had lost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega&rsquo;s fault was that he never reflected on himself, but his positive attitude was still something to learn from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega arrived at the battlefield where Kumara and Oria were fighting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He hid his presence and observed the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The conclusion of the battle came quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oria had been fatally damaged by Kumara&rsquo;s tail barrage. Fortunately for Vega, she was blown to the vicinity of where he was hiding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">How lucky. It&rsquo;s as if the heavens are telling me to eat this thing!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega thought selfishly. He had no sense of camaraderie, so there was no honorable moral that urged him to help others. This was especially true if the person in need was worthless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega licked his lips and crept closer to Oria.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, you look good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ve-Vega? Thank goodness, that person is stronger than I expected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like it. But don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll take care of the rest and avenge you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oria wondered if Vega had a soft side, but she was mistaken, and was forced to realize it by the intense pain she felt immediately afterwards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega&rsquo;s gentle touch burned Oria&rsquo;s skin. He then began to erode and eat Oria.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gah, wh-what are you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat your soul, so give me that Skill of yours, too. That right, with that, I&rsquo;ll be able to take out those small fry bastards easily.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way, Michael-sama will never forgive you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up! This is a world of survival of the fittest, right? I&rsquo;m sure that Michael bastard would be more than happy to see me get stronger!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega shouted as such, laughing vulgarly. He then accelerated the erosion, without showing any mercy to the suffering Oria.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It eventually reached her neck as he ate Oria to death with a sickening crunch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just what you&rsquo;d expect from the work of a brute&hellip;how very ugly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To me, that&rsquo;s a compliment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, even if eating Oria and her comrades was considered an atrocious act of cruelty to others, for Vega, it was merely natural means to sustain his life. He followed his instincts and utilized the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a result, Oria was completely decomposed by &lsquo;Organic Domination&rsquo; and became Vega&rsquo;s flesh and blood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wonderful, how wonderful! This power, I can feel myself getting stronger and stronger!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega was ecstatic and tested out the power he had inherited from Oria.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The mythical-grade armor covering his entire body, which had been recreated by &lsquo;Metal Manipulation&rsquo; of the Blue Dragon Spear he had taken in, glowed in the color of blood. Even his hands, feet, elbows, and knees, were armed like the fangs and claws of a beast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was at this moment that Vega&rsquo;s majin form evolved into something even more hideous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kumara, who had witnessed such a Vega, was highly alert from the start. The reason why she had thrown Oria out of the fight without finishing her off was because she had lost control when she sensed his persistent gaze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To a certain extent, Vega&rsquo;s evil presence could not be concealed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a result, Oria was dead, but Vega had been strengthened. He seemed to have been wounded when he first came here, so this could be considered a complete failure on Kumara&rsquo;s part.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">I&rsquo;ve failed, haven&rsquo;t I? What matters is not the quantity, but rather the quality of enemies. I cannot face Rimuru-sama if I allow the enemy to grow stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Inwardly breaking out in a cold sweat, Kumara thought about how to recover.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Having been defeated by Karion and then Frey, Kumara was not overconfident in her own abilities. It would have been best if she could have killed Vega here and now, but she knew that it was beyond her control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When one meets a strong opponent, it is necessary to assess their strength. If they failed to do so, the only thing that awaited them was defeat&mdash;In other words, death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kumara sincerely understood that this was unacceptable. Now that she had been taken out of the deathless labyrinth, she could not make the mistake of getting herself killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For that reason, although she felt ashamed for allowing Vega to grow stronger, she was able to avoid being dragged into a situation where she might have caused an even bigger mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One single decision could make all the difference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If Kumara had lost her temper and attacked Vega, she would have been beaten back and &lsquo;Predation&rsquo; would have been the result. However, Kumara&rsquo;s decision to wait and see allowed a third party to intervene in the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We have been ordered to withdraw. Vega, the battle is over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A figure suddenly appeared on the scene and stopped Vega, who had been ready to attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That person was Mai Furuki, who had been standing idly by until then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway ordered her to retrieve everyone, so she had used &lsquo;Instantaneous Movement&rsquo; to arrive at Oria&rsquo;s positional coordinates. However, Oria hadn&rsquo;t been there, and she had stopped Vega&rsquo;s outburst by chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega obeyed quietly. He had just gained a great deal of power and instinctively understood that he would not be able to absorb any more food.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus, Kumara&rsquo;s crises ended, and the battle was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Mai retrieved Vega and went to the place where Arios was dying. His heart had been destroyed by Souei, and Arios was doomed to defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">However, Arios and the others who had become &ldquo;Y&#333;ten</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt48" id="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup><span class="c6">&rdquo; would not die even without a heart. It was not blood that flowed through their veins, but rather mana, or divine power</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt49" id="ftnt_ref49">[49]</a></sup><span class="c1">, that was the source of their strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If they became skilled enough, they would be able to control the power at will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, there was no doubt that being without a heart was a critical situation because it prevented them from exerting any great power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the case of Arios, the remnants of his human life had not yet been shed, and he was fatally weakened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If nothing was done, he would have been dealt a crushing blow and would have died.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Souei, who had jumped back as soon as he sensed the presence, spoke to Mai.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Vega who answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;My name is Vega.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt50" id="ftnt_ref50">[50]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;You should remember this and be grateful that I gave it to such small fry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Upon hearing this, Souei wondered if his facade would slip away.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt51" id="ftnt_ref51">[51]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In all honesty, Souei was aware that he was prone to losing his temper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, that was a demerit for a covert agent, so he had learned how to separate his head from his heart and turn his anger into energy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Normally, he would be angry, but would also smile coolly and then calmly torture his enemies. This time, however, it seemed to be difficult to do so, because Souei understood at first glance that Vega had become abnormally strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">This person is&hellip;one of the leaders of Cerberus, Vega of Power. What happened in this short period of time that he became so different from the previous findings?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this world, it was possible for one&rsquo;s power to drastically increase to the extent that they became almost like a whole other person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rimuru, Souei and the others&rsquo; Lord, had also experienced the aforementioned &lsquo;super-enhancement&rsquo; such as with his demon lord awakening and the True Dragon conversion. Therefore, Souei also had an understanding of such cases.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, that did not mean that he could so easily accept this. Souei believed that it was necessary to answer the question of what had happened with Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that opportunity was lost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Mai did not want to waste time talking and had quickly withdrawn from the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;That woman, appearing without any sign and disappearing without any warning&hellip;she may be a more troublesome opponent than Vega.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Souei muttered to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kahn nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That was probably a form of &lsquo;Instantaneous Movement.&rsquo; Whether it&rsquo;s magic or a Skill, a preliminary step is required to cross through space. To be able to ignore that and jump instantly from the spot without leaving any trace is something impossible even for the primordials. Although it is theoretically possible, it is a dream-like feat that has yet to be achieved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As he walked up to Souei, he gave his reasoning for what Mai had done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Despite his wounds, Kahn&rsquo;s demeanor remained dignified. As a high-ranking demon of the demon realm, he continued to express his gratitude for Souei&rsquo;s help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oxian came over and thanked him along with Kahn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is need to thank me. I was merely following Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even though the two men had thanked him, Souei was not satisfied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For Souei, allowing the enemy to escape was a huge loss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Besides, we failed to eliminate that Arios guy. Because of that, we now must assume that our information has been leaked to the enemy, and a harder battle will have to be fought the next time. We&rsquo;ve achieved our tactical goal of survival, but I don&rsquo;t think we can be too happy about this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While Souei responded with his usual matter-of-fact manner, Kahn and Oxian looked at each other. From their point of view, they were just grateful to have survived this moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Souei could not afford that luxury, so it was natural for him to be wary of what might happen next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At any rate, just like their opponents, they had obtained information about the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Based on this information, Souei thought it necessary to rethink his strategy for the future, and while reflecting on his failure, he changed his mindset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The battle was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The forces that had been fighting outside the castle withdrew as soon as Feldway had, and they all left the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why we were all gathering to meet in the conference room where it was now safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Benimaru and I participated, along with Souei. Diablo as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The knight captains of Leon&rsquo;s forces were also there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And Guy and the other demons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was also the mysterious helper Silvia-san, Elmesia&rsquo;s mother, who joined in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Not to be forgotten was the important witness, ex-demon lord Kazalim, aka Kagali. I succeeded in using &lsquo;Isolation&rsquo; on her at the very last moment, so she was not seriously injured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Teare, who had been protecting Kagali, was badly injured. Because the recovery potion was not working on her, Maetel-san, the leader of the White Knights who specialized in recovery, was currently taking care of her in the hospital room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The only way to overcome an attack of the ultimate level was through one&rsquo;s own will. I could only pray for Teare&rsquo;s recovery.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, I was worried about Teare, but there was not much I could do about it. What mattered now was the future, which was why we were here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Each of us would report to the others and share any information about the enemy. The goal was to review our strategies for the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as our eyes met, a certain someone came right at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-kun&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">He seemed to be holding a grudge against me for ignoring him on the battlefield, and I was positive he only had complaints, so I decided to use my &lsquo;It-never-happened&rsquo; Skill</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt52" id="ftnt_ref52">[52]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;to the fullest and cover it up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You bastard, how dare you ignore me that time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-No, I didn&rsquo;t! I have no idea what you mean by ignoring you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were looking right at me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-I didn&rsquo;t notice you at all. More importantly, I&rsquo;m just glad that everyone&rsquo;s okay!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t just change the subject. Besides, Leon&rsquo;s been taken away, so there&rsquo;s no way that everyone&rsquo;s okay!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But still, we had already taken that into account, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, now, things are still on schedule with Leon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You mean the plan that you were talking about before? I can&rsquo;t help but think you&rsquo;re just pushing off the problem, are really you sure about this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy glared at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Regarding Leon, I had actually thought of a plan beforehand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As Ciel-san had suggested, using &lsquo;Predation&rsquo; on Leon, and destroying the &lsquo;control circuit&rsquo; itself was a surefire countermeasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The main reason I didn&rsquo;t do that was not because I believed in Leon&mdash;rather, I didn&rsquo;t like the idea, physiologically speaking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was not a joke&hellip;but there were other reasons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The first reason was to avoid alarming Michael.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By leaving Leon here, I wanted Michael to think that there was nothing we could do against him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The second reason was the &lsquo;hope for the best&rsquo; strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But you agreed when we discussed it, didn&rsquo;t you? If Leon, who is under the enemy&rsquo;s control, comes back to his senses after attacking, we can turn the power gap upside down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yeah. I agree that it&rsquo;s a reasonable plan, assuming that Leon is safe. If we can get to the point where Leon is attacking, that alone would give us an advantage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what I was thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was right about me pushing off the problem, and there was still the question of whether or not I&rsquo;d be able to conveniently get there, but if this went well, we could easily take out one of the enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Regardless of the number of troops, if we could replace Leon&rsquo;s strength with our own, the battle would be as good as won. As soon as Ciel-san suggested that, I had made up my mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In any case, the die had been cast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that Leon had been taken, I had no choice but to act with faith in the success of the mission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um, is Leon-sama going to be okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Alrose asked, and I gave him a big nod in response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We have the means to free him, so don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would be bad if he was suddenly executed, but I didn&rsquo;t think Michael would do such a nonsensical thing. That was also why I had approved Ciel-san&rsquo;s plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Either way, we are out of options. Let&rsquo;s trust His Majesty Rimuru. So then, here&rsquo;s the plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude-san spoke and re-established the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy still seemed dissatisfied, but this achieved my goal of diverting the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Never mind Leon, then. But Rimuru-kun, you definitely made eye contact with me back then, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Damn it, this guy&hellip;he just won&rsquo;t let it go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um, what are you talking about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare play dumb with me! You bastard, I was having such a hard time dealing with Velzard, and you just ran away without even pretending to help me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t run away. I trusted you, you know!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah? As always, you&rsquo;re such a smooth talker. The point is, if you had just quickly come to the rescue, we wouldn&rsquo;t have had to go through all that trouble!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hold on, none of that was my fault.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, what are you saying when you&rsquo;re the ones who didn&rsquo;t contact us? We were on alert and responded as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah? Isn&rsquo;t that what the magic transfer circle was for?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t activate! I mean, shouldn&rsquo;t you have been able to make a call with this ring under any circumstances?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, I was told that the Demon&rsquo;s Ring, which I had received upon becoming a demon lord, would allow me to contact the others under all circumstances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet, neither Guy nor Leon had contacted me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If Dino hadn&rsquo;t told me, the response might have been delayed even further. I hoped that he would consider that a bit more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s right. That ring was made by Velzard, so she could easily sabotage it. Sorry, I forgot about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Uh, well if he says that so openly, I can&rsquo;t really say anything back&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um, yeah. Well then, let&rsquo;s just say that it was both of our faults this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It would be a problem if there was any conflict between us, so let&rsquo;s stop fighting right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s what we did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were still a few things I wasn&rsquo;t clear on, but honestly speaking, it was too much trouble to argue further. I would just be the adult this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But enough of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;So, why are these people sitting on the floor</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt53" id="ftnt_ref53">[53]</a></sup><span class="c1">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The people I was staring at were Raine and Mizeri.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For some reason, they had been forced to sit on the floor the moment they were called into the room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, Leon&rsquo;s castle was made of stone, so the floor was completely covered with marble. It was difficult to sit upright even on tatami mats, so sitting upright on the floor in such a place seemed quite strenuous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, those guys. Do you want to hear about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you ask me if I want to hear about it, I&rsquo;ll only feel troubled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy&rsquo;s eyes were kind of scary, and I didn&rsquo;t want to get involved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not interested in&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, these two dumbasses were having fun drinking while we were all fighting desperately. I&rsquo;m also a little pissed off, so I&rsquo;m trying to figure out what to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I said I wasn&rsquo;t interested in hearing about it, but I think Guy just wanted to complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or rather, did they seriously do that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that really true?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I asked, not to Guy, but to Raine and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Mizeri remained distant and silent, but Raine appealed to me with tears in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s a tragic misunderstanding, Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as I heard that, I understood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was not a misunderstanding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to her. You&rsquo;ll soil your ears.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay. We don&rsquo;t have much time anyway, so let&rsquo;s just hurry and exchange information.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I jumped in at Guy&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The others, who had been watching our conversation, seemed to be silent on the matter. Diablo was the only one who shook his head in disgust, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to want to interfere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, we left Raine crying and Mizeri looking like an idiot and got straight down to business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was now time to listen to everyone&rsquo;s opinions in order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although there had been a tangent in the middle, the report went by smoothly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, the aforementioned tangent was the exchange made by Kahn and Misora when they reported.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When it was their turn, Kahn and Oxian stood up, but then Kahn had turned from everyone and bowed to Guy to relay his wish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Under normal circumstances, I understand that it would be an unforgivable sin to speak to our master, the Red King (Rouge). However, I beg of you to listen to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was so sincere that Guy allowed him to speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In response, Kahn requested, &ldquo;Can you please forgive my lord Mizeri-sama&rsquo;s iniquity?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I agreed with him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She had been sitting upright on the floor for the entire discussion. She was probably okay because she was a demon, but I was still wondering when it would be time to let her go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, it wasn&rsquo;t Guy who became enraged, but Mizeri, the one who was being punished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kahn! You fool. It is unforgivable&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She tried to reprimand Kahn with great force even as she was sitting on the floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Guy who stopped her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, hold on a minute. You&rsquo;ve grown up, Kahn, for being able to talk to me. Fine then. For that, I&rsquo;ll let Mizeri off the hook this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">True to his word, Guy forgave Mizeri and ordered everyone to have a drink.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was all well and good, but then came a new problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As you can imagine, Raine, who was still sitting on the floor, did the same thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now it was Misora&rsquo;s turn to stand up and speak, and like Kahn, she wished for her master Raine to be released.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But Guy wouldn&rsquo;t allow it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It didn&rsquo;t seem to be for a petty reason, such as it being the &lsquo;second version.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m also pretty good at reading the atmosphere, so I could tell that Guy was annoyed. I think Misora noticed it too, and when he said no, she quickly backed off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Knowing when to back off was a sign of competence. It made me think that Misora was a very capable person, unlike what I&rsquo;d expect from Raine&rsquo;s subordinate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There are also people who can&rsquo;t read the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why is that, Misora?! Why do you give up so easily when you&rsquo;re so much better than Kahn? You have to try harder to help me! Why am I the only one sitting on the floor while Mizeri is free? I don&rsquo;t get it!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And on and on she went.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was convinced. As I thought, Raine possessed the unconstrained self-indulging trait of the youngest child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Misora admonished Raine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please give up. If you continue committing more crimes&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Finally, Raine seemed to have calmed down after being told that much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She glanced at Guy and seemed to understand that she was in a bad position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You should be a little more sincerely sorry, you know. Do you understand what you did wrong in the first place?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Guy asked her about it, Raine tilted her head with a blank expression. It was cute, but now that I had seen her true nature, all I could sense was annoyance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy spoke to Raine with a deeply tired expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time for this, but I&rsquo;ll be the one in trouble if I let you get away with your misdeeds. Those empty bottles lying around the igloo, they&rsquo;re rare and expensive liquors, aren&rsquo;t they? How did you get them? It doesn&rsquo;t look like you stole them, or did you mug one of your subordinates again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Um, if she&rsquo;s even doing that, then she&rsquo;s definitely a bad child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or rather, why would a demon even mug someone?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even without committing such petty crimes, she didn&rsquo;t seem to have any money troubles&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While I was thinking about that, Misora interrupted me, as if she couldn&rsquo;t stand to watch anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;May I be allowed to speak?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You may.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With Guy&rsquo;s permission, Misora defended Raine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even our lord, as expected, she is not that clever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-Not that clever&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Raine was about to say something, but everyone ignored her. This incident reminded me of the importance of daily conduct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But at the very least, she is someone who does things for a reason, so you can trust her on that point.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In the first place, it wasn&rsquo;t money that Raine-sama needed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm? Then how did this guy&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although he didn&rsquo;t listen to Raine&rsquo;s words, he was taking Misora&rsquo;s plea seriously. Seeing him like that made me feel that Guy was surprisingly decent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then something strange happened here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, now, that should be enough of that, correct? We are in the middle of an important conversation about the future, and Raine&rsquo;s punishment is insignificant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then Diablo took Raine by the shoulders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was so blatantly unnatural that not only me, but also Guy, was staring at Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can still believe in Diablo after all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Raine&rsquo;s eyes were sparkling as she spoke, as if she was impressed, while the others were just confused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Something is going on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My gut was telling me so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s suspicious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy seemed to agree, muttering to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Diablo, it&rsquo;s not good to keep secrets, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Kufu, kufufufu. Rimuru-sama, I would never hide anything from Rimuru-sama.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt54" id="ftnt_ref54">[54]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;However, that person seemed so pitiful that I felt that I should offer a little help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, no, no, you don&rsquo;t have that kind of personality&mdash;I almost said that out loud, but I held myself back and swallowed it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Instead, I just stared at him. This was very effective in such situations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And sure enough, Diablo&rsquo;s eyes began to waver.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had thought that he was a demon with a weak mind, but it turned out that I was right. He immediately became flustered and told the truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, that fine liquor was actually a gift from me to Raine&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s crazy. No matter how much of an agreement you two came to, why would you give Raine something when you&rsquo;ve been in conflict until not too long ago?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was absolutely correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, but now I knew why Diablo confessed so easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As long as we had the finished liquor bottle as physical evidence, we could quickly determine the distribution route. Souei was here as well, so he must have decided that it would be impossible to keep quiet about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was all well and good, but the real problem was the relationship with the culprit (Raine).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While Guy and Diablo were quarreling, I gave Souei a look. He understood what I was asking and promptly secured the evidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">I saw empty bottles of magic black rice amazake,</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt55" id="ftnt_ref55">[55]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;traditional Japanese sake, black rice refined sake</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt56" id="ftnt_ref56">[56]</a></sup><span class="c1">, and many other products, all of which had increasingly higher alcohol content.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A person couldn&rsquo;t buy this stuff even if they paid a lot of money, because it was not available on the market. It was only available in our country, so even if it wasn&rsquo;t Souei who was investigating, one could easily identify the culprit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I mean, come on&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, you mentioned that you were having a drink earlier, did you actually drink this much?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s only natural that I was mad, right? You have to do something about them, Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, of course that would make someone angry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you kidding me?! Everyone else is working, and we&rsquo;re the only ones&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d end up feeling sorry for Guy, but it was the boss&rsquo;s job to clean up after his subordinates. I was actually surprised that Guy was so forgiving, only making them sit upright on the floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet, Raine was making excuses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong. This was a necessary item for advanced psychological warfare, and we weren&rsquo;t trying to have fun on our own!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Psychological warfare?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. I went through a lot of trouble to acquire these items so that Pico and Gracia would speak up. In fact, I think I deserve a pat on the back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This kid was incredible. Even in this situation, she was insisting that it was all her own achievements&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s a primordial demon, after all. Her mental strength was nothing to sniff at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo also seemed to adhere to the theory that as long as you didn&rsquo;t admit defeat, you hadn&rsquo;t lost, so I guess they were similar at heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Diablo, I&rsquo;m curious as well. I don&rsquo;t think you would give something to Raine for free, so what kind of a deal did you make?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I would leave it to Guy to judge Raine&rsquo;s claim, and I would pursue Diablo&rsquo;s involvement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-Well, that&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He seemed to think that he couldn&rsquo;t lie to me, and was slurring his words, but that didn&rsquo;t last long. After all, Souei was there, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Get on with it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Souei&rsquo;s words were enough to make Diablo give up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He confessed that he had been supplying the items in question in return for Raine&rsquo;s share of paintings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, so the unknown artist who was distributing my paintings was Raine&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That makes sense&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was why we couldn&rsquo;t trace her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But it seemed that my wild guess, that Diablo could be an accomplice to the portrait crime, was wrong. I couldn&rsquo;t blame him if he was only supplying goods because it was a valid act.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, I didn&rsquo;t intend to leave my portraits unattended, so I let Souei deal with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please rest assured. I have already ordered Souka to search Diablo&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a bit excessive?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. It infringes upon his publicity rights and is a serious crime deserving of punishment. A search warrant has already been issued, so there are no problems.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What quick work!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As expected, it could only be Souei.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo was crumbling in shock, but I pretended not to see it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While Souei and I were solving the mystery, Raine was finishing her explanation to Guy. It was both annoying and surprising because it was really useful information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She told us where the enemy&rsquo;s base was, and about the forces that had been gathered. Although I was not sure how much of it could be trusted, she seemed to have gleaned quite a bit of useful information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Above all, the information she provided at the end was very important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even I, who had just been listening to the conversation, turned to Raine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;&mdash;That&rsquo;s how I got the information out of them! Then, it seemed that the battle was over, and Pico said, </span><span class="c6 c16">&ldquo;Oh, I was contacted by Feldway. He&rsquo;s leaving now,&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;so I ended the girls&rsquo; party&mdash;no, I mean, I ended the interrogation!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Putting aside the fact that her true feelings were obvious, Raine&rsquo;s story was too important to ignore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Pico&rsquo;s reaction that was important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a result of Michael&rsquo;s complete control, Leon had fallen to the enemy. Diablo&rsquo;s report also confirmed that Zalario had been taken over in the process.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet, Pico and Gracia were not under control. Otherwise, it would be difficult to explain why they had been enjoying the girls&rsquo; party until the very end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This brought me to a conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael&rsquo;s control might not be effective in &lsquo;Isolation.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was very reliable information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perhaps, whether it was through visibility or &lsquo;Magic Perception,&rsquo; the control was effective only when the object was recognized. In that case, if the controlled person left Michael&rsquo;s sphere of control, there was a high possibility that he would not be able to recognize whether the control had been established or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he periodically issued orders via &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; and checked whether the orders were carried out properly or not, he might not have such suspicions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, if Leon was secretly released on the battlefield where Michael was not present, it would be possible to decide the outcome of the battle before the enemy knew about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I glanced at Guy, who was also looking at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think Raine&rsquo;s achievements are significant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I said that, Guy nodded reluctantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. She&rsquo;s a dumbass, and is useless during crucial times, but she also does things in ways I don&rsquo;t expect. I hate to admit it, but that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s done this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t like to admit it either, but there are just some people in this world who are good at what they do. Even when they look like they&rsquo;re fooling around, they still end up getting results.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">These were the so-called &lsquo;genius&rsquo; types, and recognizing the work of these people would always be a test of ability to those who were in charge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Taking away the achievements of others would be a problem, but otherwise, they should be evaluated properly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Raine was listening to our conversation, but her eyes were moistened, as if she realized that she was going to be saved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I could even feel her gratitude towards me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s Rimuru-sama for you&rsquo;&mdash;I could practically hear the voice of her heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, she was talking about it out loud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;After all, I knew that Rimuru-sama would understand the real me. Rimuru-sama, if there is anything you need from me in the future, please let me know!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even if she was saying that with such a firm expression, the moment was ruined because she was still sitting on the floor like that. That kind of thing was no good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I realized once again that Raine was a no-good child, even if that wasn&rsquo;t literally true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make Guy angry if you keep acting like that. You should reflect on yourself more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t help but give her my sincere advice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, I still had to admit that an achievement was an achievement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Raine&rsquo;s actions were not praiseworthy, but she did produce results. In that case, there was no need for further punishment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;&lsquo;Sure punishment or reward&rsquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt57" id="ftnt_ref57">[57]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;is what they say, so why don&rsquo;t we just let her go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I guess I&rsquo;ll let it go this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I nodded to Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus, Raine&rsquo;s freedom was decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After being released from her floor sitting, Raine was being congratulated by Misora and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Mizeri, who had brought tea, spoke to Raine in a dumbfounded tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I admit that you are a child capable of many things, but I wish you would change your usual attitude a little more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Raine was proud to hear that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufufu. How about that, Misora? Even Mizeri praised me. A capable woman like me, even when I try to hide it, my abilities can&rsquo;t help but come out in full force.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I listened to this exchange, I thought to myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This kid, she&rsquo;s no-good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy seemed to agree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c6 c16">&lsquo;A child capable of many things&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is not a compliment, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He spat out gravely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Until recently, I had thought she was an excellent maid from the first few times I saw her, but she really must be a big deal to make Guy feel so troubled&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While we were left feeling resigned, Raine and her subordinates were having a great time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well done, Raine-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Why does this Misora girl always stir things up?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is why Raine is always getting carried away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was getting a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu&hellip;it was that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was just like how Treyni-san was with Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She must have grown up to be a no-good child because she was always being spoiled like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As for Raine, it seemed to be too late to correct her, even if we re-educated her from now on. So, at the very least, I decided to educate Ramiris so that she would not become like Raine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, we went off on an unexpected tangent, but the discussion itself went smoothly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, I will summarize what we learned about the enemy situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega, who was supposed to be one of Yuuki&rsquo;s friends, seems to have gained power and become much more powerful. Ranga intervened just as Misora and the others were in danger, and somehow managed to fight him off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Vega had eaten the enemy named Oria that Kumara defeated, and rapidly healed his injuries and improved his fighting ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The exact numbers were unknown, but if we compare only the existence values, he seems to be stronger than both Ranga and Kumara.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He apparently had a vulgar character, flattering to the strong and intimidating to the weak. However, he also seemed to have excellent survival instincts, having survived to this point and acquiring great power, despite all odds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My impression of him was that he would be a very troublesome opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, Oria had apparently been able to create mythical-grade equipment with her own Skill. Unlike Velgrynd, Oria seems to have only materialized her weapons, but they hadn&rsquo;t disappeared when she was eaten by Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was the testimony of Fran and Kizona, the Knight Captains under Leon, and I also checked with Kumara, so I believed it to be correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, Vega must have inherited the &lsquo;Weapon Creation&rsquo; Skill. This kind of problem was the type that became more dangerous if left unattended, so I thought that it would be better to deal with him as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I, myself, am a similar type of person, so this was something I felt with a real sense of reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The warrior whom Souei defeated by surprise was named Arios. Unfortunately, he had escaped before he could be finished off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a rare mistake for Souei, but it seemed to be unavoidable after hearing his story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, there was a user of &lsquo;Instantaneous Movement&rsquo; on the enemy side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kahn also testified to this. It was not magic, but a Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The ability to jump through space without any preliminary movement was troublesome because it was difficult to measure the strength numerically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If she had mastered this Skill, we might be caught off guard. The fact that we had found out in advance that there was such a person on the enemy&rsquo;s side was a big gain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The girl&rsquo;s name was Mai Furuki, and it seems that we would have to rethink our strategy to take her skill into account.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So far, those four people were the weakest of the enemies, but they still had given us a lot of trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Some of them, like Raine&rsquo;s drinking buddies Pico and Gracia, had been reluctant to follow, but it seems that Michael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ultimate Dominion&rdquo; had turned them into our enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, I&rsquo;m sure Ciel-san would be able to something about it, but that would require a certain procedure. There was still the possibility that the control could be broken by one&rsquo;s own will, so we would have to carefully assess the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then there were the serious enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velzard, Zalario, and Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no other word to use for them but threatening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had actually fought Feldway, so I understood how strong he was. He didn&rsquo;t seem like he was serious about it, so I really thought it would be best to leave it to Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, I would postpone my talk about Feldway for later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, Guy-san, is Velzard-san going to be okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bastard, you didn&rsquo;t even come to help. You&rsquo;re talking as if you&rsquo;re somebody else&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, no, that was more of a lovers&rsquo; quarrel, and I didn&rsquo;t think a third party was needed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Quit screwing around!</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt58" id="ftnt_ref58">[58]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">You know what they say, &lsquo;not even a dog will bite into a lovers&rsquo; quarrel!&rsquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt59" id="ftnt_ref59">[59]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If I say this out loud, he might get seriously angry, so I told him so in my mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I asked him what he really thought about everything, he replied as if he was fed up with it all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not completely out of your mind. It feels like she&rsquo;s full of pent-up resentment, and her main goal is to harass me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It seems that Guy had been desperately trying not to let this country disappear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Normally, I&rsquo;d create an &lsquo;alternate space&rsquo; and fight there, but even I can&rsquo;t control Velzard. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if she agrees to it, it&rsquo;s impossible for me to impose something of my own convenience onto her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Indeed, I didn&rsquo;t think that the &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; used at Walpurgis was going to be able to control Velzard. I&rsquo;m sure there were more powerful techniques, but Guy seems to have decided that it was still too difficult.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, I guess Guy-san&rsquo;s role will be a tough one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, wait&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much for us to handle, so for this, we&rsquo;ll let Guy-san show us what he&rsquo;s made of!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy was about to say something, but I ignored him and went on with the conversation. My instincts told me that if I didn&rsquo;t, I would surely be caught in the middle of it all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was worth it, because Guy seemed to be convinced, although he was glaring at me resentfully. I was relieved to see that and switched my thoughts to the next enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Diablo. How did it go with Zalario?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufu, to be honest, Zalario is a strong opponent. If we compare on simple strength alone, he might even be better than Feldway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Feldway will come to you if you encourage him, but Zalario is a cold-hearted warrior. Psychological warfare does not work on him. He&rsquo;s a very uninteresting opponent, but that is why we have to play to our strengths.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy agreed with this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Zalario&rsquo;s always been strong, unlike Cornu and the others. He was quite useful in the fight against the &ldquo;World-destroying Dragon&rdquo; Ivarage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I see. So, he&rsquo;s a solid opponent who is hard to upset. No matter the world, I guess it&rsquo;s common knowledge that the strongest are those whose minds can remain undisturbed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If an opponent runs away as soon as they are about to lose a battle, they are not a threat no matter how strong they are. On the other hand, an opponent who does not give up no matter how difficult the situation is troublesome because you cannot let your guard down against them until the very end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In that sense, Cornu was the former, and Zalario was the latter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Especially in the case of Cornu, he had a good lieutenant whom Guy paid more attention to than Cornu.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that Cornu and his team had been wiped out, there was no point in talking about them here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In any case, it&rsquo;s clear that Zalario was a threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then, Diablo started saying something interesting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, right after Feldway reappeared, his movements became monotonous. Something must have happened to him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo was suspicious and had kept a watchful eye on him. As a result, he concluded that it was not a trap but some kind of anomaly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What was interesting was the fact that it was just after Feldway&rsquo;s move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What was Feldway&rsquo;s purpose in the first place?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t participate in Kagali and the others&rsquo; battle, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s correct. As soon as I saw Feldway, I was put under Michael&rsquo;s control, but Feldway himself kept a watchful eye on me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Benimaru and I looked at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If Feldway had entered the battle earlier, we would not have made it in time and Kagali would have been killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If that had happened, Silvia-san would have been in danger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was unnatural that he didn&rsquo;t make a move, and unless he had no intention of doing anything, there was no need to go to the place where Kagali and the others were fighting&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So then, why did he need to move?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There must have been a purpose, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose so. I mean&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. One possibility is that our speculation was correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as I thought of it, Guy nodded, looking convinced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I hated to admit it, but that was the only explanation I could think of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose we should assume that Feldway can also use the Ultimate Dominion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Diablo who said this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy was not happy, as if Diablo had said it before he could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Silvia-san who asked, but Kagali seemed to be thinking about it as if she had something in mind. After pondering for a while, she opened her mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um, I don&rsquo;t expect for you to believe my opinion, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kagali seemed to understand that she was in a delicate position and started the conversation in that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Guy denied it outright.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I believe you, Kazalim</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt60" id="ftnt_ref60">[60]</a></sup><span class="c1">. So don&rsquo;t hold back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy seemed to have recognized Kagali as the ex-demon lord Kazalim at first glance. And yet, he was ready to listen to her without a care in the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">In a way, this was the moment when I realized that Guy was a big deal.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt61" id="ftnt_ref61">[61]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still as confident as ever, Guy. I&rsquo;m not a demon lord anymore. So, I&rsquo;ll just be Kagali.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With a small smile, Kagali began to speak her thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To summarize Kagali&rsquo;s story, she had free will before Feldway&rsquo;s arrival, and she had made plans to betray him after consulting with Leon in secret.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After walking a tightrope of a battle, Feldway showed up just as she was about to jump into the &ldquo;magic transfer circle.&rdquo; Immediately after that, she was taken over without even being allowed to resist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The timing was so bad that it could only be described as bad luck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yuuki had apparently regained his self-awareness, so it would have been a perfectly happy ending if they could have escaped to our country. However, it was meaningless to talk about that now, as it was a hypothetical story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In any case, there was no doubt that there was a close relationship between Feldway and the domination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, the credibility of Diablo&rsquo;s reasoning had increased, but I didn&rsquo;t like to admit that, so I presented a negative possibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The problem is the condition for triggering the Ultimate Dominion. Michael seems to be able to transfer certain powers, and it may be possible to activate it from a distance as long as someone can see you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In my case, I was able to exert a certain amount of power over the area I could see through the Argus spell. This was one of the secret techniques that I wanted to keep secret as much as possible, since it allowed me to take people by surprise from a great distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, I should have realized that what I could do, others could do as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what I was thinking, but Guy denied it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. It&rsquo;s possible, but if it&rsquo;s a spatial power, or even a power that affects the mind, I think the conditions for activating it would be more severe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was convinced that was the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I had said many times, &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo; required one to know the positional coordinates of the destination. If you could get that information, then you could influence the area around the coordinates as an application.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or, if you know the positional coordinates, it is easy to activate the spell. When I think about it, it makes me feel vain that I was so happy when I said it was a secret technique.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the first place, Feldway was not the only one who was Michael&rsquo;s &ldquo;eye,&rdquo; and it was strange that Kagali was free when Michael gave her the power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, it is probably because of Obera&rsquo;s betrayal that Michael became more cautious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he had been able to activate the &ldquo;Ultimate Dominion&rdquo; when he became more alert, he would not have needed to rely on Feldway. But since that was not the case, there must be a reason why Feldway was Michael&rsquo;s &ldquo;eye.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then&hellip;was Feldway given the Ultimate Dominion, as Diablo said?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&laquo;This is a speculation, but Michael has taken in Velgrynd&rsquo;s dragon factor</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt62" id="ftnt_ref62">[62]</a></sup><span class="c1">. If so, it would not be surprising if he was able to utilize her &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; ability.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ah, so that&rsquo;s a possibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had thought that a certain level of control could be lent to him, but I hadn&rsquo;t expected him to have duplicated all of the abilities. Nevertheless, I could not ignore Ciel-san&rsquo;s opinion, and now it really felt as if I was dealing with Michael.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In that light, it certainly explained why he could use the Ultimate Dominion. On the contrary, he could even use Castle Guard, so it was no wonder that my attacks were completely unsuccessful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had been bluffing when he blocked my sword, and he actually hadn&rsquo;t even needed to defend himself. I was really relieved that I didn&rsquo;t show off my secret techniques.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What Guy says is correct, but if Feldway can use the same powers as Michael, doesn&rsquo;t that explain what happened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? So Michael was ceding his power to Feldway?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, not that. I&rsquo;m saying, as much as I hate to admit it, that both of them can utilize the same powers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? What the hell are you talking about&mdash;no, so it&rsquo;s that! Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parallel Existence?!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s Guy for you. He understood what I was trying to say so easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy and I both frowned at that unpleasant speculation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was hoping to be mistaken, but that was also why I definitely thought it to be the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like they weren&rsquo;t all taken over at the same time, so that&rsquo;s fortuitous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The fact that the effects of control did not occur at the same time was obvious from the fact that there was a time lag between Zalario&rsquo;s domination and the domination over Leon and Kagali.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In addition, the extent of the influence of control was also limited. This was evidenced not only by the difference between the inside and outside of the castle, but also by the fact that Pico and Gracia, who had been in Isolation from the outside world with the igloo, were not taken over until later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Leaving aside the pros and cons of the &lsquo;igloo,&rsquo; this information was valuable. That was because it confirmed that domination could not be achieved unless it was recognized by some means.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah. Raine and the others slacked off, but it was still a worthwhile achievement. It proves once and for all that you must be able to recognize your opponent in order to dominate them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy seemed to agree with me and said so in a dissatisfied tone. The reevaluation of Raine certainly seemed to be a touchy subject.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But, well, this allowed us to correctly evaluate the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um, I can&rsquo;t keep up with this conversation at all&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I briefly explained to Silvia-san, who raised her hand in a reserved manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">El-tan was terrifyingly sharp, but Silvia-san didn&rsquo;t seem to be the same way. Or perhaps I was comparing her to the wrong people. Leon&rsquo;s knight captains didn&rsquo;t seem to be able to follow our conversation either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To begin with, Leon&rsquo;s subordinates were a different story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It didn&rsquo;t matter how smart they were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the first place, without an Ultimate Skill, it would be impossible for one to understand this conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As one could see from the fact that El-tan had founded a country as the celestial emperor, it meant that Silvia-san&rsquo;s daughter had a certain savvy over her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, while Silvia-san is said to be stronger than El-tan in terms of strength, El-tan is said to be more insightful and adaptable. It went without saying that El-tan had the political strength, so they were able to share their roles properly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, while explaining the situation to Silvia-san and others, I tried to sort out the situation in my own way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was likely that Michael was duplicating his powers and giving them to Feldway. So, in effect, Feldway could not be defeated without breaking through the &lsquo;Castle Guard.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And because he could probably utilize not only the Ultimate Dominion but also the control system, it was impossible for anyone but an Ultimate Skill user to defeat him. In that case, the number of people who could take on Feldway and Michael would be limited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not all bad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My attacks didn&rsquo;t work at all against Feldway, but I feel better now that I understand why. Moreover, Velgrynd told me that the ability is fueled by loyalty to the master. When Rudra used it, he was invincible as long as there were Imperial subjects, but that has nothing to do with Feldway. His subjects are probably Phantoms, so it makes me feel a little less guilty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Killing innocent people in the Empire was honestly too much for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, actually, if that was really the only way, I guess I had to accept that the happiness of the many would come from the sacrifice of the few&hellip;I thought I was prepared to do it, but I wasn&rsquo;t completely sure if I would. I think I may have just been bluffing with Michael, but I didn&rsquo;t think I could have actually done it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Phantoms are invaders, so they must be prepared to die. Therefore, it would be polite for me to resist with all my might, and my conscience would not be hurt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I expressed my feelings straightforwardly, Guy was taken aback.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ha! Are you still talking so naively? Well, it&rsquo;s true, but if you overthink things, you&rsquo;ll be the one who dies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I even got some friendly advice from him, but I thought that Guy was surprisingly lenient to his people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that we had discussed the main enemies, there was still one left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, who is this Jahil?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the guy I had been dealing with. To be honest, I thought I had gotten pretty strong, but that guy was surprisingly powerful. I barely survived because we shared the same attributes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I brought up the question, Benimaru took a stab at it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He has always had a cool personality, yet he was praising Jahil, his enemy. Well, he wasn&rsquo;t&rsquo; praising him exactly, he was just accurately analyzing the enemy&rsquo;s strength&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rare for Benimaru to honestly admit defeat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t lose though? It&rsquo;s just that I can&rsquo;t easily say that I&rsquo;ll win the next time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I wondered about that, but was relieved to see that Benimaru&rsquo;s confidence was still intact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, if there was more than a fourfold difference in the estimated existence value, a slight difference in ability will not be enough to overturn it. Benimaru had gone through a lot of training to reach his current level of skill, so it was unlikely that he would grow rapidly from here&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;&hellip;&hellip;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, as long as he didn&rsquo;t lose heart, he could stand up and face them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the other hand, I had to be careful not to let Benimaru do anything rash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Guy, for example, seemed to like Benimaru, and said, </span><span class="c6 c16">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Then, as if remembering something, he suddenly muttered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm? Come to think of it, what was the name of the bastard who summoned me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was answered by Mizeri and Raine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;It was a lowlife bastard who called himself the Great Magician Jahil,</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt63" id="ftnt_ref63">[63]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;the head of state of the Great Magic Empire.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt64" id="ftnt_ref64">[64]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;That ba</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt65" id="ftnt_ref65">[65]</a></sup><span class="c6">&mdash;he was a high human created by the Divine Ancestor</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt66" id="ftnt_ref66">[66]</a></sup><span class="c1">. I think even the Divine Ancestor considered him a failure because of his mental problems.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s said that he was killed after summoning Guy a long time ago, and he was mentioned in various grimoires and history books.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The books I saw in Ingracia didn&rsquo;t mention him by name, but his reckless misfortune made him quite famous as a fool who unleashed the worst demon onto the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That demon was the primordial&mdash;that is, demons like Guy and Diablo and the others, so it was understandable that El-tan and Gazel were wary of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But now, it was no use worrying about them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The worst of them, Guy-san, has become one of us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Also, the said fool&rsquo;s name was Jahil, which couldn&rsquo;t be a coincidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While I was pondering over this, Kagali said something surprising.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&hellip;that Jahil, he was definitely my father.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She said that Feldway had protected Jahil, who had lost his body and had become a wandering soul and had incarnated him in Footman. According to her conversation with Jahil, there was no doubt that he was Kagali&rsquo;s father.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Silvia-san objected to this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, that can&rsquo;t be right, can it? He admitted that he and I are colleagues. He was the first highborn brother of the Divine Ancestor, and I was the third. By the way, Luminas-chan was the second.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jahil is the ancestor of the high humans created by the Divine Ancestor. And naturally, the true ancestor of the vampires is Luminas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, the ancestor of the high elves is Silvia-san, I guess?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s said that there were other highborns, but they are not known to exist now. They are said to have disappeared into history like Jahil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, Gazel&rsquo;s grandfather, Gran Dwargo, the first Hero King of the dwarf race, was a kind of ancestor who inherited the blood of the High Dwarf and was a close friend of Silvia-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For long-lived species, even historical figures were acquaintances. Silvia-san and Guy were like living witnesses of such history. I didn&rsquo;t think it was wrong to say that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh? My father was definitely a high elf&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kagali was puzzled, but she understood that her perception was more unreliable. She was trying to figure out why there was such a discrepancy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And the conclusion arrived at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My father, by Jahil was&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He was taken over by Jahil, then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, what can I say, that guy was a lowlife bastard. It&rsquo;s no wonder Raine and Mizeri couldn&rsquo;t get rid of him, but that seems to have caused a problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is what Kagali, me, and Guy had to say about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With the three of us in agreement, Jahil&rsquo;s identity had been confirmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So then, my father is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kagali muttered, leaning back in her chair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unsure of what to say to her, we decided to leave the room quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then, it was night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy and I moved to another place to have a drink together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By the way, the drinks being served were the ones I kept in my &lsquo;Stomach.&rsquo; It was the result of Guy&rsquo;s forceful insistence that I prepare the same drinks that Raine and the others had been enjoying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I wanted to tell him to shove it, but I was a sucker for things that would last.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was too tedious and tiring for me to defend myself against Guy, so I decided to give in and sell him the favor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo, Benimaru, Souei, Raine and Mizeri were also present at the party.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Another person, Silvia-san, was also present, and the secret late-night meeting proceeded quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What would we do with this country now that Leon was gone?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was the content of this secret discussion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since we had been able to ascertain the enemy&rsquo;s strength during the daytime meeting, we were now reconfirming our future plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The damage to the town was not too bad, but Leon&rsquo;s castle was badly damaged, and there were people who had nowhere to go. It was a problem that there was no place to receive the refugees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The general consensus of the knight captains was to stay in the country and rebuild the town and castle, but if the Aggressors were to target this place, it would be difficult to deal with it. They would not be able to stop them from overrunning the place because they did not have enough forces to fight them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that Leon was gone, the probability of this place being targeted was low, but even so, I didn&rsquo;t think we should do nothing about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re going to stay, why don&rsquo;t we just let them do what they want?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was Guy&rsquo;s opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m the one who was against it because it was dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But you know, there&rsquo;s no point in just talking about ideals, right? You can ask El-chan, but I don&rsquo;t think Sarion will accept them, either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The total population of Leon&rsquo;s country was less than 20 million. It would be impossible to prepare enough food to feed such a large number of people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, they could endure for a few days, but if they didn&rsquo;t know for how long, there was nothing they could do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The people of the Golden Land El Dorado would be psychologically disheartened if they were to be sheltered without working. To be away from one&rsquo;s work for a long period of time was enough to make one feel uneasy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The idea of evacuating to another country was unrealistic, as was pointed out earlier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the other hand, having someone stay behind to guard them was also&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, Guy, you won&rsquo;t be staying here, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I guess it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s no good. As I thou&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, it&rsquo;s not like we have a choice. This place is of little importance anyway, but even so, there&rsquo;s always the possibility that they&rsquo;ll take it out on them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No way, is this a joke?!<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I hadn&rsquo;t expected Guy to agree so openly, so I was at a loss as to how to respond.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t expect the terribly ruthless and cruel Red King (Rouge) to be such an understanding demon&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The peoples&rsquo; rumors sure were unreliable, Silvia-san was surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I agreed with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you bastards trying to pick a fight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way!

Have you settled down yet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, it was so long ago that I don&rsquo;t even remember the details now. There is no point in getting oversentimental about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kagali replied as such, but it was clear that she was trying to be tough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Mizeri had thoughtfully prepared a seat for Kagali. Kagali thanked her and sat down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, is there something you wanted to talk about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Guy who asked directly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I think that was one of Guy&rsquo;s strengths.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perhaps Kagali felt the same way, and she opened her mouth with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just thought I&rsquo;d tell you everything I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Looking at Kagali&rsquo;s refreshed expression, I thought to myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is going to be a long story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although I had listened roughly to the discussion during the day, I felt that what I was about to hear would include Kagali&rsquo;s private life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, I wanted to first ask for confirmation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s okay for us to hear about this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I am grateful to Rimuru-dono, so if you don&rsquo;t mind, I would love to do so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If she was putting it that way, then there was no reason to refuse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We listened to Kagali&rsquo;s story in silence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a personal story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It summed up Kagali&rsquo;s long life as a princess of a great nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The guilt she felt towards Milim, the fear she felt towards Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her resentment towards Leon and its sublimation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Listening to Kagali&rsquo;s story, I almost felt guilty for having killed Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, the Clayman in Kagali&rsquo;s story was a kind and caring man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I could tell from Kagali&rsquo;s tone of voice that he was loved by his friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, he had been distorted by his role as demon lord, and in the end, he was used by Lieutenant Kondou. As a result, he became the cause of many misfortunes, and was abandoned by demon lords, particularly Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And I was the one who had killed Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About Clayman, well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, there is no need to apologize. It was I who devised the plan, and Rimuru-dono was just better than I was. After all, this is a world of survival of the fittest, and there is no need to show mercy to the loser.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was also true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the first place, Clayman had been completely evil from our point of view, and if I hadn&rsquo;t eliminated him, we would have suffered a great deal. Even if you say that there was another side to him, it can only be said to be true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, there were some things that I should think about regarding the fact that he was probably being manipulated, and I might have even developed some sympathy for him in an unorthodox way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I decided to tell Kagali something that I had been holding back, wondering whether I should tell her or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, I wanted to talk to you about Teare&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Teare was another one of the Moderate Clown Troupe members who had been giving us trouble. She wasn&rsquo;t as bad as Clayman or Footman, but that didn&rsquo;t change the fact that she had been a nasty enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But now that we have an agreement, we were no longer enemies. It was natural for us to help her as an ally, if not as a friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I rescued Teare when she was about to be killed by Jahil, but she had been seriously injured while protecting Kagali. She was still resting in her hospital room, but Ciel-san was helping her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;&lsquo;Isolation&rsquo; of the &ldquo;information particles&rdquo; that constituted Clayman&rsquo;s &lsquo;heart&rsquo; has been completed. Would you like to combine them together to make up for Teare&rsquo;s missing components?&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I was asked this question, I agreed to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Looking back on it, I had swallowed Clayman&rsquo;s end whole. I thought I had absorbed all of him as energy, but it seems that the residue had been placed in &lsquo;Isolation.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t want to leave such a thing behind, and I thought Clayman would be happier to return to his friends rather than to remain in my body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perhaps, Ciel-san could have revived Clayman completely. It seemed to me that the success rate would have been reasonably high if the Emulated Soul had been inhabited by the information particle residue and given a temporary body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But I never heard the answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Clayman was dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is why I wanted to help him as a part of Teare from now on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was completely my own decision and ego, and I had not been sure if I should tell Kagali and the others. But now, I thought I should tell them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Is that so&hellip;that kid, with Teare&hellip;thank you.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt68" id="ftnt_ref68">[68]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kagali muttered and smiled wistfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought I was just doing it for my own self-satisfaction, but I&rsquo;m glad Kagali seemed to be happy too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would have been better if the conversation had ended there&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, Rimuru-kun, I&rsquo;ve been listening to you, and I think you&rsquo;re being too selfish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed&hellip;even the Divine Ancestor didn&rsquo;t do such a crazy thing as collecting the residues of the dead and transplanting them into others!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I forgot these guys were here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would have been better if I had just ignored them, but I took the bait.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When did you guys become such good friends?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? We don&rsquo;t really get along. It&rsquo;s not bad though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right! From my point of view, I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s incomprehensible when you just casually chat with the Lord of Darkness, who is synonymous with fear!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It doesn&rsquo;t matter even if you say something like that, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, Guy was a little more open-minded than I initially thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t get angry over trivial things, so as long as you kept in mind the things you should pay attention to, he was easier to get along with than you might think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I knew Rimuru-kun was strange. Even more so than what El-chan told me. To begin with, I thought Guy Crimson there was a horrible demon who became a demon lord after killing my brother Jahil in seconds. If it were that easy to get along with him, no one would have any trouble, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t have the chance to interrupt her as she rambled on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Seeing us like that, the person in question spoke with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s quite brazen of you to say that in front of me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ah, Silvia-san seems to have taken a liking to Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guy has a tendency to give respect to those who don&rsquo;t fear him. This seemed like a nice start to a good relationship for the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In any case, I thought I had gotten away from the subject, but that was not the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Rimuru. What did you do with the Clayman residue?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, Guy hadn&rsquo;t forgotten, so I had no choice but to explain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, it just sort of happened, you know? It really was just a coincidence when I was saving them from Jahil&rsquo;s attack&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I just let it slip out of my mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a little sad that I had gotten used to this, but telling the truth was out of the question. I had no intention of revealing my abilities, and if the situation arose, I intended to keep silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s suspicious&hellip;are you hiding something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Talk to him more. He always keeps his mouth shut about the important things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sh-Shut up, you guys! There&rsquo;s a lot of things I don&rsquo;t understand, and I don&rsquo;t know why it happened this time either!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Actually, it was Ciel-san who did it, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t know anything about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, I don&rsquo;t want others to get involved in it either&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rather, Guy and Silvia-san had never met before, yet somehow, they were in perfect harmony. Today was the first time we had met too, but Silvia-san looked just like El-tan, so it didn&rsquo;t feel like it was the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, unexpectedly, the late-night secret meeting became friendly and lively.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Following the flow of the conversation, Silvia-san broke the ice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way. Kagali-san, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should ask this, but I was wondering if you could tell me about your friends?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no mockery in her manner, but rather an air of determination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kagali, who responded, was also puzzled to see Silvia-san like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But then, as if remembering something, she opened her mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have an idea of what you want to ask me, so it&rsquo;s fine. Also, you don&rsquo;t have to address me with &lsquo;san,&rsquo; so you can just drop the honorifics.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you. Then you can call me Silvia as well. Now, I know it may seem sudden, but&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Laplace, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. You heard about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Laplace was reacting to your voice when you called him Sarion. Sarion&hellip;if the Sarion from the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Dynasty is Laplace&rsquo;s real name, then I&rsquo;ve got a hell of a person on my side&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Their conversation continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had no idea what they were talking about, but they seemed to be talking about Laplace&rsquo;s true identity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Or rather&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh? Laplace is an ex-Chosen Hero?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. And by the way, he&rsquo;s my husband, and El-chan&rsquo;s papa.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Seriously?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dead serious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I looked at Kagali in astonishment, and she nodded back calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She seemed to have already sorted things out in her mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And the same could be said for Silvia-san, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It must have been a long time ago, but she didn&rsquo;t show any sign of resentment towards Kagali, even though she should have resented her more for the fact that her husband, who she thought was dead, had been turned into an undead elf.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I don&rsquo;t blame you for hating me, but I&rsquo;m still glad that I met Laplace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to hear that, too. It makes me believe that he didn&rsquo;t change his character even after he died. The way he defended you at the end made me realize that the man I loved is gone&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">According to Silvia-san, Laplace could have escaped if he had wanted to. But he didn&rsquo;t do so, perhaps because he was proud to be a member of the Moderate Clown Troupe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, there was no way of knowing the truth now&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not necessarily true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t mean to comfort her, but those words came out of my mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was selfish of me, but I couldn&rsquo;t give up hope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ciel-san had told me that the chances of them being alive were not zero. That&rsquo;s why I decided to believe that Yuuki and Laplace were still alive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the first place, Yuuki had always given me a lot of trouble, but as he was also Japanese, and a disciple of Shizu-san, I expected to be more shocked at his death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The reason why I did not feel sad was because I suspected that his death was a lie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, it&rsquo;s true that he had disappeared right before my eyes without a trace, but I couldn&rsquo;t trust him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because I had been deceived by him many times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s alive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As long as I thought that, there was no need to be sad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. The boss is really stubborn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Sarion has been alive all this time and hasn&rsquo;t even contacted me, so he really is a no-good person. He just reincarnated as an undead elf and lost his memory, leaving me alone. It&rsquo;s no use worrying about such a no-good guy, so I&rsquo;ll change my mindset!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Apparently, my words were not in vain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was worried that my words might have been inappropriate, but if I could lighten Kagali&rsquo;s and Silvia-san&rsquo;s feelings even a little, then I had done a good job.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, the late-night conversations continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overcoming today&rsquo;s sorrows to win tomorrow&rsquo;s battles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><ol class="c11 lst-kix_list_1-0" start="4"><li class="c5"><h1 id="h.1fob9te" style="display:inline"><span class="c15">Interlude<br>The Army of Justice</span></h1></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Feldway returned to the Heavenly Star Palace, Michael had just returned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like you got beat up pretty bad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah. Something unexpected happened. I went out to purge the defector Obera, but my &lsquo;Castle Guard&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? I didn&rsquo;t have a problem&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably why. These powers are one at their core. Since you&rsquo;ve set your loyalists as phantoms, I&rsquo;m guessing that there&rsquo;s no one who knows about me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu, that&rsquo;s against the basic principles of the skill. It&rsquo;s natural for your allegiance to be nullified.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The two reported each other&rsquo;s situation as if they were having a casual conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a surprise to Feldway that Michael could not use the Castle Guard. However, because he was able to figure it out without sustaining serious damage, it was okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What he was more concerned about was what Obera, the traitor, would do and how it would end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what happened with Obera?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Unfortunately, she escaped. Obera&rsquo;s subordinates were admirably loyal and successfully protected her from the rest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael stated matter-of-factly that it was a shame to have lost such valuable assets. Even though he had killed them all himself, his attitude was like that of someone else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The soldiers under Obera&rsquo;s command were excellent. It&rsquo;s a shame to have lost such a force.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even Feldway&rsquo;s reply was so indifferent that it was hard to believe that it came from the heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, Obera&rsquo;s subordinates were loyal only to Obera and had no relation to Feldway. That is why he did not consider this a great loss to him. It would not affect the Castle Guard in any way, so he decided that it was not a problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This callousness was the reason why Feldway was not well-liked. However, Feldway did not care about this and continued his rationalism to the utmost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was different in the past, but there was no trace of that time left in the present Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael changed the subject.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He looked at the newcomers, Leon and Jahil, and confirmed that their forces had decreased since before the battle. He nodded his head and began to speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think we need a chain of command for our forces. Feldway, since you are the Supreme Commander, I think we should consider who should be placed under you, what do you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When asked, Feldway nodded with a &ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right. Now that we&rsquo;ve talked to the last person we were negotiating with, we should decide on what to do before we start the full-scale invasion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus, once again, the main members of the Celestial Realm, excluding Zelanus&rsquo; forces, gathered in the audience hall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">First, Feldway presented the results of the current operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael nodded in agreement, but since he had already heard the story, this was just a formal exchange for Dino.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, so Oria was killed in action.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino spoke absent-mindedly. In truth, she had been eaten by Vega, but such an explanation was omitted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino had never really known her, but she was still a friend. He closed his eyes and prayed for Oria&rsquo;s soul, thinking that he should be allowed to mourn for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino was followed by Pico, Gracia, and Mai, while the rest of them kept blank faces. No one seemed to wonder about the tenuous relationship, and the meeting began without further discussion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway took over as the moderator of the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael, not wanting to interfere, remained silent and watched the proceedings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The topic of the meeting was the appointment of positions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The purpose was to clarify the hierarchy so as not to interfere with the full-scale invasion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega was the only one with an ambitious look in his eyes, while the others were indifferent. Dino, for his part, seemed blatantly unmotivated and shrunk back to avoid being forced to take any responsibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Under such circumstances, Feldway&rsquo;s announcement began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">There was Michael as Supreme Leader</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt69" id="ftnt_ref69">[69]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Feldway himself was named Commander-in-Chief</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt70" id="ftnt_ref70">[70]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;and Chief Executive Officer.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt71" id="ftnt_ref71">[71]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velzard was the advisor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The decision was made to leave her free to roam, as she alone would be a fetter to block Guy&rsquo;s movements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of the remaining people, only nine were strong enough to be commanders, most notably Zalario.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, there was one more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The last one, who was not here, was an old acquaintance and friend of Feldway&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Including him, there were ten of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Normally, a commander would need to have a tactical mindset, but on a battlefield where individual strength was important, strength was all that mattered. Feldway&rsquo;s idea was that as long as the hierarchy was set, the rest could be left to the discretion of the commander.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was completely wrong, but it had worked so far. So, without any hesitation, Feldway set the hierarchy of strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The strongest, along with himself, was the old friend who was not here. He was followed by Zalario and Jahil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Feldway decided to appoint these three as the new &ldquo;Three Phantom Commanders.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt72" id="ftnt_ref72">[72]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;First of all, we will establish the new &ldquo;Three Star Commanders</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt73" id="ftnt_ref73">[73]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo; to replace the position of &ldquo;Three Phantom Commanders.&rdquo; As generals of Veldanava-sama, I want you to exert your power to the fullest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The reason for the name change was that there were two people other than the phantoms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The star, of course, referred to the &ldquo;Star King Dragon.&rdquo; It was a title intended for one to serve as a general with the purpose of reviving Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cornu is dead, and Obera has betrayed us. In place of these two, I will appoint Jahil. The other one is expected to enter the war soon and will be appointed at that time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as he announced this, there was a murmur of discontent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey now, you&rsquo;re appointing some random bastard to be a supreme general of the Heavenly Army instead of me? That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This time, Vega, empowered by eating Oria, was getting carried away again. He was a very unfortunate man who appeared to have lost the concept of remorse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The only person who could handle Vega well was Yuuki, but Feldway didn&rsquo;t care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up. My decision is final. If you make another comment, I&rsquo;ll have you executed. Are you prepared for that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Feldway didn&rsquo;t have any idea how to utilize human resources.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt74" id="ftnt_ref74">[74]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He possessed a very clear mindset that all that mattered was whether someone was useful or not. Anyone who was not useful would be discarded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is why he was not well-liked, and Feldway did not care about that. Next time, if Vega disobeyed him, he would seriously dispose of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega, with his superior survival instincts, could sense this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Vega who had been feeling all-powerful after his growth, found Feldway&rsquo;s strength to be on a different level. He knew that he was not yet a match for Feldway, so he had no choice but to retreat quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn, I&rsquo;m sorry. I wanted you to think more highly of me, so I interrupted you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He made up for the mistake and pushed down his dissatisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, he smiled once he heard Feldway&rsquo;s next comment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so rotten about it. I think highly of you as well. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m giving you the lead position of the &lsquo;Seven Angels of Death.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;Seven Angels of Death&rdquo; was also the name of the group that was supposed to consist of the ultimate skill holders of the angelic lineage. But alas, there were not enough of them. Feldway, who did not care about details, designated the remaining main force as the &ldquo;Seven Angels&rdquo; in order to make up the numbers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Originally, he had planned to appoint Kagali and Obera as part of the &ldquo;Seven Angels,&rdquo; and Vega was going to be included as one of the &ldquo;Four Star Commanders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Mai and Oria were going to be assigned as auxiliaries, to serve as support. Unfortunately, from the very beginning, the plan had been drastically modified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In any case, he decided to assign Zalario, Jahil, and one more person, as the &ldquo;Three Star Commanders.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Seven Angels&rdquo; consisted of Leon, Dino, Pico, Gracia, Arios and Mai Furuki, with Vega at the top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, the &ldquo;Three Star Admirals&rdquo; were to command their respective corps, while the &ldquo;Seven Angels&rdquo; were to engage in single and multi-personal operations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then, the main strategy was discussed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that we have Leon amongst our ranks, it can be said that we have broken one of the demon lords forces. This means that we have one less point to attack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At Feldway&rsquo;s words, Mai projected a miniature version of the Cardinal World and lit five points of light on the ground. One of them, the white dot on the continent controlled by Leon, disappeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Only four spots remained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But then, Feldway pointed to a point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Mai changed the color of the spot from white to red.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need this place either. My friend has promised to help me, rather than Guy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The extinguished spot of light displayed the far west, Dagruel&rsquo;s territory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you saying that Dagruel has switched sides?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Leon who asked that question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The one who nodded in agreement was the third member of the &ldquo;Three Star Commanders.&rdquo; He was a slender man with an exceptionally large physique.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have arrived, Feldway. You&rsquo;ve done a bold thing, releasing me from the seal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The man was not Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His long, shaggy hair was green. It was not the same as Dagruel&rsquo;s dull blue hair. His eyes shined like jade, which was also different from the blue-eyed Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, they were vaguely similar in appearance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">The man&rsquo;s &ldquo;name&rdquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt75" id="ftnt_ref75">[75]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;was Fenn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">He was the younger brother of Dagruel, the &ldquo;Continent&rsquo;s Wrath,&rdquo; and was known as the &ldquo;Mad Fist&rdquo; titan</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt76" id="ftnt_ref76">[76]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;who had been sealed away by Veldanava during a rampage in ancient times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The first to react to the sight of Fenn was Dino, who was normally laid-back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be, you released the Gleipnir that was binding Fenn?! Even though Dagruel has been so vigilant, Feldway, what the hell are you thinking?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And, quite unusually, he questioned Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was still surprised, and his tone had become rough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, don&rsquo;t worry. Fenn and I are friends. Our interests are aligned, and&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway insisted that Fenn&rsquo;s abilities were tremendous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn&rsquo;s magicules, which he was not trying to conceal, were leaking out as a supreme energy that overwhelmed the others. In terms of existence value, it exceeded sixty million, and was so vast that it could be said to rival the True Dragons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, there were other people besides Dino who were uncomfortable with Fenn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn, an evil deity sealed away in ancient times. He&rsquo;s the kind of tyrant that even I wouldn&rsquo;t want to deal with, let alone the Divine Ancestor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jahil spat viciously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He did not know the man directly but had heard about him from the Divine Ancestor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">According to him, he was an evil deity who had been sealed by Veldanava for his destructive acts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In Jahil&rsquo;s mind, he was the second most evil incarnation after the &ldquo;World-destroying Dragon&rdquo; Ivarage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That legend was now standing in front of him. Faced with this fact, Jahil was disgusted to the point of nausea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But Fenn didn&rsquo;t care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Smiling, he put his arm around Jahil&rsquo;s shoulders and whispered in his ear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Hey now, we&rsquo;re all friends, right? Let&rsquo;s get along. I heard about it. Like you, I was appointed as one of the &lsquo;Three Star Commanders.&rsquo; Unlike the rest of those small fry, you&rsquo;ve got something to offer.

I forgive you for now. I don&rsquo;t intend to end up like this either, but I&rsquo;ll leave things alone for now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And with that, he agreed to work for Fenn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that that was out of the way, they were wondering about the reaction of the remaining Zalario, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to have any intention of fighting in the first place. This was not just because he was under the control of the Ultimate Dominion, but also because Zalario, as a warrior, understood his own strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Whether he could win or not could only be seen in actual combat. However, an all-out battle would cause enormous damage to both sides and would undoubtedly affect the future of the war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would be pointless, to say the least.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is why Zalario decided to end the situation by giving in himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus, Fenn was appointed as the leader of the &ldquo;Three Star Commanders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With all the actors in place, all eyes turned once again to the miniature Cardinal World.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Feldway. What do you mean that Dagruel&rsquo;s not a problem? I understand that Fenn-dono has joined our ranks, but that&rsquo;s not the end of the matter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn replied to Jahil with a smirk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey now, that&rsquo;s just sad. Are you underestimating my abilities? If you know me, then you should understand, right? Dagruel is certainly my big brother, but I&rsquo;m more powerful than him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jahil replied bitterly to Fenn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need that kind of boasting. If you really have no problem with it, just show me the results.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jahil was arrogant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even though he recognized Fenn&rsquo;s ability, he did not intend to give up his pride as an emperor to follow him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn seemed to like Jahil and smirked at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even though you know me, you still have that attitude. That&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;ll live up to your expectations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn smiled happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to talk to anyone ever since he had been sealed away in Veldanava so long ago. Despite this, scenes of the world had still been flowing into his mind as if he were dreaming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was because he was connected to his brother, Dagruel, and his other brother, deep in his soul.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">That is why he was aware of the world situation to a certain extent. He understood that they were at the verge of the beginning of the age of civil war,</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt78" id="ftnt_ref78">[78]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and that this was an environment where he could be violent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway was the only one who had visited Fenn when he was sealed up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As for Feldway, he had only been taking care of Fenn because Veldanava entrusted him to do so. At some point, they became friends, exchanging small talk and consulting each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway had no relatives to talk to because he was the leader.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn, too, had come to realize that solitude was lonely after being sealed for so long.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In a sense, it was inevitable that they had come to trust each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And now, Fenn had been given a place to play, and a friend to show off his power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no reason for Fenn not to be excited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t not that Fenn was less violent than he used to be, it&rsquo;s just that he had learned to value his friends more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn was more than happy to have friends. That is why he was grateful to Feldway from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn had announced that he would take care of Dagruel, but Dino was still not satisfied with this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, wait, wait! Hey, are you seriously okay with this, Feldway? If we let Fenn go, won&rsquo;t we lose the reason why Dagruel is guarding the Heaven&rsquo;s Tower?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Heaven&rsquo;s Tower was the stairway to the Heavenly Star Palace. Those who did not have the key to open the main gates had no way to enter the Heavenly Star Palace except through the Heaven&rsquo;s Tower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Dagruel who guarded it, and his reason for doing so was to keep Fenn from being unleashed upon the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino was saying that if Fenn were to attack, there would be trouble depending on the outcome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even though he was under the control of the Ultimate Dominion, Dino&rsquo;s thoughts were free. It would be different if he were under a stronger control, but he could still say what he wanted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, the same was also true for Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His actions were constrained, but his thoughts remained unchanged. That is why, even in the battle with Silvia, he was able to minimize the damage by not attacking extensively.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In addition to that, he had also sent signals with his eyes, but unfortunately Silvia did not understand them. It was not because Silvia was not perceptive enough, but because she had been very busy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">However, even if she had been able to understand the signals, the information would have been limited to </span><span class="c6 c16">&ldquo;Leon still has free will,&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">so it wouldn&rsquo;t have been very meaningful anyway&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In any case, at the moment, the Ultimate Dominion only restricted his actions, but still allowed him to think freely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For Feldway, however, this was more convenient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He couldn&rsquo;t have a strategy meeting without flexible thinking, so Dino&rsquo;s comment was welcome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good point. So, what do you think we should do to alleviate this anxiety?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, well, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino&rsquo;s momentum dissipated as soon as he was asked the question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had been so surprised that he spoke up, but when he thought about it, it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;d be at a disadvantage. He was back to his normal self, wondering what he&rsquo;d even gotten upset about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-No&hellip;even if you ask me such a difficult question, well, it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s a problem, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At any rate, as safely as he could, Dino tried to sit down as if his role was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But Feldway would not allow it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I believe in Fenn, but Dino&rsquo;s concerns are justified. So, I think the best solution for this situation is to send some other people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;You were planning to do that all along,&rsquo; Dino thought. Saying it out loud might sound like Feldway didn&rsquo;t trust Fenn, so Dino&rsquo;s comment must have been a blessing in disguise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">More importantly, in this case, Dino, the speaker, might be forced to participate&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino&rsquo;s prediction came true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re worried about it, aren&rsquo;t you Dino? In that case, you should see for yourself how strong Fenn is with your own eyes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, no, I&rsquo;m not&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t be shy. You won&rsquo;t be able to have a turn, but if you want to see how strong I am, I won&rsquo;t stop you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He wasn&rsquo;t planning to do that anyway, but now it was too late. Dino gave up and nodded reluctantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Th-That&rsquo;s true. Then, I guess I&rsquo;ll take your word for it and participate with Pico and Gracia.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wha&mdash;hey, Dino! Don&rsquo;t drag us into this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously, I really don&rsquo;t want to. I just had a fight to the death with Raine. Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s cruel to ask me to fight again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino&rsquo;s companions were furious, but Dino ignored them. He figured out that they were probably slacking off anyway, and forcibly involved them to distribute the work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway had no objection to this and approved it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was true that he trusted Fenn, but Dagruel was also a powerful man. He was not to be taken lightly, and Dagruel also had another brother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The story of the three giants who rampaged in ancient times was well known. As someone who knew the truth of that legend, Feldway was prepared to make the best move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leon, please join them. In addition to Fenn, there will be four of the &ldquo;Seven Angels&rdquo; attacking the Heaven&rsquo;s Tower. I think that should be enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus, the members being dispatched to the next target had been decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The meeting seemed to be ending, but instead of that, everyone moved on to the next topic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s determine the next attack point.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh? Isn&rsquo;t it time to go on the offensive?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah. We&rsquo;re planning a simultaneous invasion, taking full advantage of the aggressor&rsquo;s capabilities. Rather, with all due respect to Fenn, you are the decoy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Decoy&hellip;then who&rsquo;s the real target?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino was not interested in the mission, but he wanted to ask. He thought it might make himself feel a little better if the other locations sounded more difficult.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides, if he could successfully meet up with Rimuru, he might be able to ingratiate himself with some useful information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even though it was not in his character, he asked Feldway the question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The first thing I want you to remember is our purpose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was the answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino wondered what the purpose was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It must have been something ridiculous, like bringing back Veldanava. Of course, Dino would be happy if Veldanava was revived&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Doesn&rsquo;t Veldanava-sama have his own reasons? Maybe Feldway became too much trouble for him, or maybe he wanted to back off until the humans had matured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino thought that it would be more ignorant for them to make selfish assumptions about Veldanava, the creator and transcendent being.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Those who speak for the god are the most troublesome. They can distort your opinion without your permission when you openly state a different interpretation. It seems that Luminas had a difficult time with this, and that&rsquo;s why she said she stopped appointing humans as the Pope&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even if they hear the exact same words, there are differences in the perceptions of those who receive them. Because people believe only what they want to believe, they are reluctant to admit when they are wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As an actual example, Luminas had never said that she was the &ldquo;one and only God.&rdquo; Yet, for some reason, her followers had come to believe that Luminas was the only god. It seemed that this was more convenient for Luminas, so she did not deny it, but the fact that the truth changed when people intervened in the interpretation of the truth was troublesome if it was handled in the wrong way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After observing the human world for a long time, Dino had come to understand this. And yet, his colleague was setting a bad example, and he felt like giving them a break.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Only the Veldora factor remains as a necessary element to revive Veldanava-sama. But there&rsquo;s one more obstacle we mustn&rsquo;t forget. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Is that so?&mdash;Dino wasn&rsquo;t involved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet, Feldway&rsquo;s eyes were on Dino.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">Whoa, whoa, whoa, it&rsquo;s me?!</span><sup class="c4 c16"><a href="#ftnt79" id="ftnt_ref79">[79]</a></sup><span class="c6 c9">&nbsp;Give that to someone else!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As he looked around, he saw that everyone had kept a serious, blank expression on their faces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Zalario seemed to be holding on to the fact that he was dominated and was ready to ignore Feldway completely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Leon had just arrived and did not seem to be following the conversation, nor did he seem interested in it in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The same went for Fenn and Jahil. Fenn and Jahil did not know the answer to the question, because it was still new to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Pico and Gracia didn&rsquo;t seem to know either. They were hiding behind Dino, looking down for good luck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The other members of the &ldquo;Seven Angels&rdquo; were not Feldway&rsquo;s friends, but useful pawns. They were not the ones he wanted to ask for opinions, and Dino was the one who had to deal with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Is this a joke?! Because Kagali and Yuuki are gone, I&rsquo;m being put in charge of the thinking?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; Dino thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That should have been Zalario&rsquo;s job. Dino finally realized that he had unwittingly drawn the short straw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that didn&rsquo;t mean that he could do anything about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t want people to get their hopes up, so he decided to play along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you want to hear about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He smiled and replied in a suggestive manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At that, Feldway nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">I knew it. He&rsquo;s too smart for his own good and doesn&rsquo;t want the others&rsquo; opinions. I thought I could make a conversation with him if I just praised him!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino nodded back, thinking it was a good thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Dino is correct, we must get rid of this irregularity, Masayuki. In the unlikely event that Rudra is resurrected through Masayuki, there is no guarantee that it won&rsquo;t affect Michael-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything,&rsquo; Dino thought, but he was careful not to show it on his face. He nodded his head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He knew that the logic was warped, but he wasn&rsquo;t so good-natured as to point it out here, so he was inclined to let people do as they pleased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The others were similar, and none of them expressed their opinions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway continued his explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that Veldora is deep in that troublesome labyrinth, our next target is Masayuki. If we start with that and reduce their strength one by one, he&rsquo;ll have no choice but to come out of his hole.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t come out, we&rsquo;ll just cut off his other forces,&rsquo; Feldway said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m pretty close with Masayuki,&rsquo; Dino thought, but he wasn&rsquo;t paying attention. He wanted to tell Masayuki that he was being targeted somehow, but he couldn&rsquo;t think of any way to do so now that Michael&rsquo;s control had been strengthened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even the &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; with Rimuru could not be carried out, as this would be a clear act of betrayal. The only thing left to do was to hope for a great coincidence there, but that seemed impossible, so Dino gave up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The only thing left to do was pray that he would get away safely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, do you know where Masayuki is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good question, Dino. Regarding that, Velzard&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, yes. From Velgrynd&rsquo;s presence, I have a rough idea of his location. There are several locations inside the Empire, and one in the Kingdom of Ingracia, where the girl is responding. The haki is completely hidden, but my eye cannot be deceived.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was the Frost Dragon Velzard&rsquo;s cognitive ability, equal to or greater than Milim&rsquo;s &lsquo;Milim Eye.&rsquo; She had no trouble detecting the presence of her siblings, let alone other people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd appeared to be using &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; to fortify the empire. At the same time, it was assumed that she was also guarding Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In response to Velzard&rsquo;s comment, Mai manipulated a miniature light spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Following the west end ruled by Dagruel, the central west area ruled by Luminas changed from a white light to a red light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway pointed to the red light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This means that Masayuki is here, in Ingracia. I will leave it to you to attack there, Vega. What do you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was not a question, but an order. He was only saying that to lift Vega&rsquo;s spirits a little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega, being a simpleton, did not see it that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He grinned and nodded happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me. It&rsquo;s a former home, with many hidden passages that no one knows about. I&rsquo;ll sneak in and take care of this Masayuki kid.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Hm,&rsquo; Feldway nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had planned to let Vega run amok as a diversion and have Arios kill Masayuki while he was at it, but he wondered if that was possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Either way, he intended to go to Ingracia&rsquo;s capital himself. Therefore, Feldway decided to let Vega do as he pleased and watch the enemy&rsquo;s movements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of course, that was not all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Zalario, you are to lead the entire army to our support. Find out what Luminas is up to, and if she moves, stop her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And if she doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stand by. If I give the order, launch an all-out assault on Ingracia&rsquo;s capital.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway&rsquo;s orders were absolute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Zalario nodded meekly, keeping his frustrations to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Currently, Jahil was the only one who hadn&rsquo;t been ordered to do anything yet. There was no way Feldway was going to leave his &ldquo;Three Star Commander&rdquo; force idle, so Jahil waited for Feldway&rsquo;s words while preparing himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Also, let&rsquo;s be careful. Jahil, you&rsquo;re the support.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt80" id="ftnt_ref80">[80]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll leave you in charge of my subordinates, and you&rsquo;ll do what you can to help Fenn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, isn&rsquo;t that a bit much? I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s necessary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that Fenn. It&rsquo;s just a precaution. Once you take control of Dagruel, you&rsquo;ll have an army of your own, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But as long as Dagruel is alive and well, there will be times when the Titan&rsquo;s army will get in the way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s my job to stop them?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn boasted that it was unnecessary, but Feldway was correct in this case. As for Jahil, it didn&rsquo;t matter to him either way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If Fenn is active, he can just watch him, and if he is in danger, he can sell him a favor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides, he didn&rsquo;t even need to be in a hurry to succeed, because the opportunity to play an active role would eventually come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph! It&rsquo;s a shame that they&rsquo;re not the ones I trained, but it can&rsquo;t be helped. As soon as I see Fenn&rsquo;s victory, I&rsquo;ll attack from the west to the center, do you mind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sure, do as you like.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as he heard that, Jahil went silent, implying that the conversation was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jahil was an ambitious man. He owed a debt of gratitude to Feldway, even if it meant doing his bidding. Considering the difference in strength, he thought it would be wise to follow him for the time being.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, Velzard reported directly to Michael, so Feldway had no authority to give her orders. The current policy was for Feldway to let her do as she pleased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this way, everyone&rsquo;s roles were defined.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Once the plan was settled, Michael spoke up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have one more thing to say. Regarding the labyrinth in the Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s domain, it is not a good place to be trapped. I think it would be better to lure them out, as Feldway said. Therefore, I&rsquo;ve decided to hand over Demon Lord Milim&rsquo;s sphere of influence, centered on the former Eurazania, to Zelanus. As for the capital of Ingracia and the territories of Milim, Demon Lord Rimuru will not be able to ignore any war that breaks out in his land. Be sure to defeat the reinforcements that he will send. If we do, our victory will be unquestionable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael&rsquo;s words were full of conviction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, that was the greatest advantage for the aggressors. The destruction of the enemy&rsquo;s forces through individual assaults. Repeatedly doing so would guarantee victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In addition, once the bases other than the capital &ldquo;Rimuru&rdquo; were eradicated, the siege formation would be complete. There were many mysteries in Ramiris&rsquo; labyrinth, and it was possible that there was more than one way in and out, but being able to stop the operations was significant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It may be possible to bring in strategic supplies, but once separated from the world, it would be easy to reduce their influence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, since the ultimate goal was to capture Veldora&rsquo;s dragon factor, they couldn&rsquo;t simply wait and see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That being the case, Michael decided that it would be best to bring the situation to that point and then slowly devise a strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This may have been the right strategy, but Dino was not convinced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, Milim is the daughter of Veldanava-sama, you know? Do you understand that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He complained, as if expressing his indignation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But Michael remained aloof.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Are there any problems?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He asked Dino, his cool expression still intact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are there any problems? No, no, I&rsquo;m just wondering if it&rsquo;s going to result in Veldanava-sama&rsquo;s displeasure&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was a natural question from Dino&rsquo;s point of view.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would be an act of betrayal to Veldanava to touch Milim. So, what was Michael thinking?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Michael&rsquo;s reaction was very calm, and he seemed to think that there was no problem at all. The same was true of Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dino, I am aware. Demon Lord Milim is the daughter of Veldanava-sama, however, she is no different from us in that she was created by him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was doubt of that being Michael and Feldway&rsquo;s true thoughts. Their respect and loyalty seemed to be directed only to Veldanava, with not even a shred of affection for his daughter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jahil seemed to agree, sniffing and scowling at Dino with a mocking gaze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Having been destroyed by Milim&rsquo;s wrath in the past, he was feeling a sense of pleasure at the Eurazania invasion operation. Dino&rsquo;s opinion, which might interfere with it, was not interesting to Jahil either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Hey now, this is why Obera betrayed us! They really have a bad way of thinking&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino thought to himself as he looked back at Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he didn&rsquo;t do something, he would be branded a traitor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway spoke to Dino.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Dino. If my actions are wrong, then he will come back to correct them. If his beloved daughter is in danger, he will surely come to her aid. That is why my action are correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that he had said that, there was nothing left for Dino to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His old friend was dead. If only he had realized this sooner, he would have been able to escape&mdash;Dino regretted it even now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">And so, the outline of the Tenma Great War</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt81" id="ftnt_ref81">[81]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;was decided and carried out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And on that day&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The world was thrown into a whirlpool of chaos by a great calamity that would drastically change the course of the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><ol class="c11 lst-kix_list_1-0" start="5"><li class="c5"><h1 id="h.3znysh7" style="display:inline"><span class="c15">Chapter 2<br>The Beginning of the Great War</span></h1></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After the discussion that night, it was decided that Kagali and Teare would remain in my country&rsquo;s custody.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Teare was still unconscious, and it was safer to take care of her in the labyrinth. We could get detailed information and find out if there was any malicious intent at work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, it was only natural that Kagali would come with me. I accepted the two of them without any complaint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Silvia-san returned to Sarion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She would&rsquo;ve been a great help as a warrior, but what was most important to Silvia-san was Sarion, where her daughter was. I couldn&rsquo;t just force her to do anything I wanted, so we promised to cooperate with each other if anything happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I also gave her a cell phone, just in case. El-tan had one, but I decided that it would be better for Silvia-san to have one as a backup.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The communication function of the Demon&rsquo;s Ring was not universal, and it was best to have as many means of communication as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After this trouble was all over, we could use them for fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After exchanging our contact information, I saw Silvia-san off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And now, I was in my office.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was so much paperwork that I almost felt as if my daily life had returned to normal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just by looking at them, my anger towards Feldway seemed to increase by about 30 percent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Look, I wasn&rsquo;t just playing around either. And yet, there were piles upon piles of proposals that needed my approval, and a mountain of meeting notes for various measures that were being taken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For the time being, I was putting off the meeting notes. I didn&rsquo;t need to rush to look at them because they had already been done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I looked through the new projects that needed approval and quickly decided whether they were acceptable or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was busy, but it couldn&rsquo;t be helped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, the day after tomorrow, the world conference would be held in Kingdom of Ingracia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, a world conference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This would be the first such event in history.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The participation of the Emperor of the Eastern Empire in the Western States Council, which was regularly held in the West, was an unprecedented event.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Actually, I was supposed to meet up with Myourmiles in the Kingdom of Blumund and go with him. But then some idiot decided to invade Leon&rsquo;s country, and that&rsquo;s why our plans were thrown off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a mistake that I was now forced to fill in the gaps with these documents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was all over now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All I had to do now was to sip some tea and relax.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I would try to calm down and collect my thoughts before the show.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, here&rsquo;s your tea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Diablo, not Shuna, who brought me the tea. He was working hard as a secretary, probably because Shion was away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you. You should take a break with me, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I said as such, encouraging Diablo to sit face-to-face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo was thrilled and looked at me to say something like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m honored,&rdquo; but I ignored it and started talking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what kind of guy is Feldway, from your point of view?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From my point of view, he seemed to be surprisingly unpopular.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he wasn&rsquo;t, Dino wouldn&rsquo;t have betrayed him so easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Anyway, what I needed now was information about the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you know what kind of character they have, you will be able to judge to what extent they can bluff or not in case of emergency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I understood well enough that he was cautious, so I thought I would ask if there was anything else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo thought for a moment and then answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a serious guy. He is hard-headed, inflexible, or whatever you wish to call it, but once he has made up his mind, he will not ben his will. He has a personality that doesn&rsquo;t consider other people&rsquo;s opinions even as a reference, so his peers were divided in their evaluation of him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, for a yes-man, he is an easy boss because they only have to do what they are ordered to do, and for a talented and creative person, he is an uninteresting boss who ignores their own opinions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It can be very stressful if your opinion is not accepted. If there is a good reason that is explained to you, you will be satisfied, but if there is just a rejection, you might be left with a grudge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is there anything else?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I asked, Diablo began to worry, muttering, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then he responded with an &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain about this,&rdquo; and went on to tell me something more important than I had expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To put it simply, it was about how to get to and from their base and this world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They&mdash;the Aggressors, were the altered versions of those banished from this world by Veldanava and the angel legions that were their watchers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Their base, of course, was in the Otherworld.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The connection between the Otherworld and this place, the Cardinal World, was a special force field called the &ldquo;Underworld Gate,&rdquo; and there were several of them around the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were guarded, or rather controlled, by the demons. Surprisingly, they were expanding their sphere of influence around the &ldquo;Underworld Gate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The only one known to exist was the &ldquo;Underworld Gate&rdquo; guarded by Carrera, not too far from Leon&rsquo;s territory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The other gates guarded by Testarossa and Ultima had disappeared due to a major battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re better off without them. If you go to the Otherworld with your body, it will be contaminated and transformed. Those who come here from the other side are almost certainly Aggressors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He told me bitterly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In short, it would be easier to destroy the &ldquo;gate&rdquo; itself since it only brought chaos in this world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa and Ultima didn&rsquo;t approve of that. They had been guarding the gate for a long time, but when Diablo went to scout for them, the gate was broken, so they had been easy to recruit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought to myself, &ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be true, right?&rdquo; but I didn&rsquo;t say it. As proof, the gate that Carrera had guarded appeared to be broken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At present, it seemed that the gates had been left unattended because one could not come and go without great power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I secretly thought that the correct answer was that it was broken on purpose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But back to the main topic, what Diablo was wondering about was how Feldway and the others had come to this world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo speculated that perhaps a new &ldquo;gate&rdquo; had appeared somewhere in the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Or maybe they&rsquo;ve restored the gate that Testarossa used to guard?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I cannot deny that possibility. However, it doesn&rsquo;t match the time when Feldway appeared in the Empire, so it is certain that another &ldquo;gate&rdquo; exists.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, that made sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So then, you&rsquo;re assuming that the Aggressor&rsquo;s base is inside the Empire, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, I confirmed as such, but Diablo&rsquo;s concern was something else entirely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not all. From what I heard of Kagali&rsquo;s story, there is no doubt that Feldway has opened the gates to the Heavenly Star Palace. One would need a &ldquo;key&rdquo; to open it&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;Heavenly Star Palace,&rdquo; also known as the place of beginnings, and the birthplace of Veldanava, I believe. As Kagali had explained, Feldway&rsquo;s base was adjacent to every world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, Diablo&rsquo;s concern was about how to get the key&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is no point in worrying about how they got it. What matters is that if you pass through the gates of the Heavenly Star Palace, you can come to the Cardinal World with the body that exists in the Otherworld.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oops, I&rsquo;m glad that I didn&rsquo;t put that into words because it was way off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even so, what did he mean by the body that exists in the Otherworld?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Of the Primordials</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt82" id="ftnt_ref82">[82]</a></sup><span class="c1">, only Feldway was given a body by Veldanava-sama. The current one is only inhabiting a temporary body, so there is no point in killing it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is this something like Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parallel Existence?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s different from that. It&rsquo;s not like they are connected all the time, but rather they&rsquo;re splitting their consciousnesses. He&rsquo;s probably synchronizing his memories periodically, so there are no inconveniences&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why it was so troublesome, Diablo explained to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From what I could understand, Velgrynd was like a set of synchronized computers connected to the internet, and Feldway was like a set of computers disconnected from the internet, with only the data being transferred from the terminals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;That seems to be the correct understanding. In other words, &lsquo;Spacetime Continuous Attack&rsquo; will not be able to reach the main body, so he is a very troublesome opponent.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I see, very troublesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So then, unless we go to the place where the main body is to defeat Feldway, you can&rsquo;t defeat him. It&rsquo;s certainly troublesome&hellip;but, huh? If the main body is going to go out of its way, isn&rsquo;t that convenient for us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rather than searching for someone we don&rsquo;t know where he is, it would save us a lot of trouble if he came to us. That&rsquo;s what I thought, but it seems that it was not that simple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. However, he is simply quite strong. It&rsquo;s possible that his main body&rsquo;s fighting ability could surpass that of Guy&rsquo;s. That is why I wondered if we needed to be prepared for any eventuality.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The body Veldanava had given him was a treasure to Feldway. That&rsquo;s why Feldway was always inhabiting a temporary body to avoid damaging it. But we also had to consider the possibility of him reversing that belief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I think that was correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The situation should not be turned upside down by a single idea from the other party. And even more so when it was a force that couldn&rsquo;t be ignored.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A serious Guy is on par with Velzard-san. That means that Feldway is also comparable to a True Dragon, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, that is correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo says that Feldway was pretty bad back in the day. Compared to the &ldquo;Insect Lord&rdquo; Zelanus, and the &ldquo;World-destroying Dragon&rdquo; Ivarage, he was a bit of a letdown, but in reality, that wasn&rsquo;t really the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even the existence value measured in the labyrinth was not accurate if it was not the main body. So, Feldway&rsquo;s true power was unknown&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it to you, but you&rsquo;ll be okay, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I planned to leave Feldway to Diablo. I was surprised to hear that Feldway&rsquo;s true strength was that of a True Dragon, but I knew Diablo would be able to handle&mdash;No, isn&rsquo;t it impossible as expected?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But as soon as Diablo heard my words, he replied with a big smile on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I am deeply moved</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt83" id="ftnt_ref83">[83]</a></sup><span class="c1">, Rimuru-sama. I will continue to strive to live up to your trust!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oh, this, it looks like it&rsquo;s okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo may be overconfident, but he does not take on things he cannot do. He may or may not be able to win, but he seems to think it&rsquo;s possible to deal with Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If so, it would be foolish for me to worry about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">It is always better to have a trusted subordinate fight against an opponent who&rsquo;s fight may turn out to be an indefinite battle</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt84" id="ftnt_ref84">[84]</a></sup><span class="c1">. So, I decided to let Diablo to do his best, as I had originally planned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that I understood how bad Feldway was, I was curious about the next target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How do you think he&rsquo;ll make his move?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s right&hellip;it&rsquo;s hard to predict, but based on Feldway&rsquo;s personality, I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s most likely planning to go after Masayuki-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The unexpected answer took me by surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But it was certainly an opinion I could not ignore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought there was no point in going after Masayuki, but then I reconsidered the possibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Why was Masayuki targeted in the first place?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They had probably suspected that he was the reincarnation of Rudra and wanted to kill him. And this was proven by the fact that Velgrynd loves Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway was probably more wary of Rudra than Masayuki. The reason for this was unclear, but it was certainly not surprising that Masayuki would be a target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In the first place, I don&rsquo;t think the reason is important. I don&rsquo;t mean to be insistent, but Feldway is a hard-headed man who won&rsquo;t admit to his own mistakes. He is not the kind of guy who would give up just because he failed once.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo said it just like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was even more convinced in that case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then the next meeting might be dangerous. Velgrynd-san will be escorting him, so unless something goes wrong, I think we&rsquo;ll be fine, but you should be on the lookout as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please rest assured. I am always perfectly prepared for anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s the kind of thing I can trust in Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Regardless of his personality, he is an excellent worker. His rival, Shion, was also on a business trip right now, so there was no need to worry about him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo and I were continuing our detailed conversation, identifying any concerns, when we received some shocking news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;There&rsquo;s been a huge problem, Rimuru!!&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The call came from Milim, full of a hint of trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Actually, Obera has escaped.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Oh?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;She said that she was caught betraying Feldway and got into a fight with Michael.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was not something one should talk about on the Telepathy Net via Demon&rsquo;s Ring. And so, I decided to go to Milim&rsquo;s place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Milim&rsquo;s castle was under construction, but there were still some habitable parts that were already completed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was also a medical facility in one such corner, and Obera was lying in one of the rooms there. When she had first escaped to this place, she had been in a serious condition, to the point of unconsciousness, but now she was awake, and her upper body was upright on the bed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It seems that she had been asleep for a long time, and we hadn&rsquo;t been able to hear what happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nodding my head, I greeted Obera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Rimuru, Tempest. I&rsquo;m a demon lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since it was our first meeting, I started by introducing myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Frey-san, who appeared to have grown more attractive, looked at me as if she was taken aback.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It may be impolite to say this to the Demon Lord Rimuru, but don&rsquo;t you think you should learn to show a little more dignity? It is one thing to able to do your duty during an emergency, and another to be able to do so duty in your everyday life. The difference is obvious to anyone who sees you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I immediately received a complaint, but from Frey-san&rsquo;s point of view, it was probably because she was worried about the negative influence on Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because Rimuru was&mdash;because Milim was always making excuses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was probably it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was like a mother worrying about her bad friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile because it was so funny.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Seeing me, Karion smirked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s tough having Frey on your radar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hey now, don&rsquo;t say that just because you got a new ally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Both Karion and Frey-san, while they might say a lot of things, treated me casually when nobody else was watching. I had asked them to do so and was grateful to them because I didn&rsquo;t have to be so formal that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even so, the atmosphere around the two of them had changed significantly. Benimaru had reported it to me, but now that I was seeing them in person, they were like different people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I heard about it, so you&rsquo;ve taken full ownership of the power you&rsquo;ve awakened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh yeah. Tell Benimaru that I owe him for his help the other day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Karion was good friends with Benimaru. He liked Benimaru when he picked a fight with him during their first meeting, and they had been friends ever since.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even though the power relationship between them was now reversed, the fact that Karion didn&rsquo;t mind at all, and even boasted that he would soon catch up to overtake him, proved how big of a person he was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The same was true of Frey-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful to you for that. Now I can be of more use to Milim than before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She smiled and thanked me, but that didn&rsquo;t mean that it was easier scold Milim now, did it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I suspected as much but accepted her words of gratitude as it went without saying that I would need her strength to survive the Great War.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even so, Ramiris&rsquo; labyrinth is a foul play. I never realized that there was such a use for it, even though we had been together as demon lords for such a long time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for sure. I thought she was just Guy&rsquo;s favorite, but I&rsquo;m surprised the little pipsqueak</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt85" id="ftnt_ref85">[85]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;had that kind of power hidden.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she wasn&rsquo;t hiding it. It&rsquo;s just that no one noticed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I knew about it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Knowing about it is useless if you are unable to do anything with it. That labyrinth made me understand that. That&rsquo;s why, Milim, don&rsquo;t be a sore loser.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The know-it-all Milim was being chided by Frey-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Laughing at this, Karion expressed his opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But well, I can&rsquo;t laugh at Milim. We look like idiots too. But, hey, it makes sense, doesn&rsquo;t it? When it comes to treating others well, no one can match Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. In that sense, we are also the ones being used.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Frey-san nodded, but I hadn&rsquo;t expected that about Ramiris&rsquo; labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">I initially thought I would just try and make use of it, and after asking, I couldn&rsquo;t help going, </span><span class="c6 c16">&ldquo;What? Is that really possible?!&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I was surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And through trial and error, the current labyrinth was born.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since I had not envisioned it from the beginning, their opinion was an overestimation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But well, just by the results, the labyrinth really was amazing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The fact that you can come back to life even if you die in the labyrinth is a foul play, no matter how you look at it. The labyrinth was perfect for training, and from a defensive point of view, it was just too impregnable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a wonder that Ramiris had been underestimated, and it felt like my own achievements were practically nonexistent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, I felt that it was wrong to talk about it, so I just laughed and covered it up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, let&rsquo;s finish our greetings and get down to business, shall we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Frey-san&rsquo;s words changed the atmosphere of the hospital room into a serious one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">At this point, Obera, who had been looking at us with a wide-eyed look</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt86" id="ftnt_ref86">[86]</a></sup><span class="c1">, tightened her expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Finally, she said a few words of greeting to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nice to meet you, Demon Lord Rimuru-sama, I am Obera of the former &ldquo;Three Phantom Commanders&rdquo; and head of the anti-cryptid forces.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera began by saying so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She spoke with a mysterious look on her face, but there was no hint of a lie. Just as Milim and the others believed, my intuition was telling me that it was true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But just in case, I decided to poke my head in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just for the record, you do understand that betrayal on the eve of a major war can lead to suspicion of espionage, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. I have no way of proving my innocence, but I will tell you everything I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The expression on Obera&rsquo;s face was sincere, without a single trace of cloudiness. She explained what had happened, even though she wasn&rsquo;t in the best of shape yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After she had finished her discussion with Milim, she returned to Feldway and the others. It was good that she received a physical body there, but at the same time, she also acquired an angelic skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Sensing that she could be in trouble, Obera considered the possibility that she might be controlled by this power. She then discarded the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Salvation King Azrael&rsquo; that she had acquired before Feldway could take control of her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Silvia-san taught me this technique of separating the mind from the Skill. I was impressed by her knowledge, but when I thought more about it, I wondered if her betrayal had been exposed because the enemy had sensed Obera&rsquo;s abandonment of her Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a result, Silvia-san and Kagali and the others had a difficult time, but it might be wrong to put the blame on Obera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I would just dismiss it as an unavoidable situation and pretend that I didn&rsquo;t notice it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What was more important was the truth or falsity of Obera&rsquo;s story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Quite frankly, I found it credible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;I agree. The story was coherent, and she even talked about information that normally should have been hidden. If she&rsquo;s willing to go this far, it&rsquo;s not worth the price of espionage.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She spoke fluently to us about being attacked by Michael, and about his power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She told us that Michael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Castle Guard&rdquo; had not been activated, that he had used both Velgrynd and Velzard powers as a matter of course, that his power had destroyed Obera&rsquo;s army, and so on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was interesting to examine the information from the perspective of whether there would be any merit should it be false. That is why I had always searched for the opposing opinions of information on the Internet and tried to find out whether the information was for or against, and what the source was, and so on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This method was also effective on Obera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If Obera had been deceiving us, she would have lied about Michael&rsquo;s powers, but this information was too true. Even Ciel-san&rsquo;s verification result showed that it was true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s more, Obera had agreed to accept my &lsquo;Analyze and Assess.&rsquo; If I did this, I could almost certainly confirm the existence of her skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The result of this also came out clean.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was determined that Obera did not have the &lsquo;Salvation King Azrael&rsquo; and was not being controlled by Michael.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all this, believing in Obera was the correct answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I gave Obera recovery medicine and honey and asked her to try to recover as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was decided to leave Obera to Milim and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The information obtained from Obera was shared among the demon lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was no longer a time to be afraid of leaking information. We all agreed that it would be too late to explain anything after something had happened to someone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Two days passed by in a hurry, and just like that, the day of the World Conference had arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Benimaru was staying back home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As commander-in-chief, I entrusted him with the protection of Tempest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For my escort, I had Ranga and Souei lurking in the shadows, and Diablo as my secretary. With this group, I was sure to be able to deal with things even if Feldway himself attacked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Boss! I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much I can do for you today for the big event, but please let me know if you need anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Youm greeted me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Myuran was not in sight, apparently staying at home. Instead, Gadra was there as Youm&rsquo;s escort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We greeted each other briefly and promised to meet up later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After today&rsquo;s events were over, there would be a buffet party. After that, some of us were planning to go to Ingracia&rsquo;s capital for a drink in a relaxed atmosphere with people we knew well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I went to the assembly hall with a bit of excitement and met up with Masayuki at the square in front of the hall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since Masayuki was the main character of the day, I welcomed him as an acquaintance and an intermediary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, have you grown taller?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had grown a bit taller since I became a True Dragon. I used to be able to look Masayuki in the eye, but now we were back to the same height difference as before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can tell? I think I&rsquo;ve actually grown up a bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki smiled happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Upon closer inspection, his hair was also a bright blonde.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your hair too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s completely discolored. I&rsquo;ve gotten used to it, but it was a bit disconcerting at first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At this point, I wondered if it was some kind of anomaly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had thought it was an exaggeration, but Rudra might actually be coming back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But then again, Masayuki was still Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I stopped worrying about it, and we went into the chamber together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the large circular venue, which I had already visited several times before, the heavyweights from various countries had already arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was noisy and bustling in its own way, but as soon as they saw us, it all went quiet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All eyes were focused on us, but we were used to it by now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki seemed to be the same, and he didn&rsquo;t appear to be nervous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve become more dignified.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. When I was enthroned in the Empire, there were so many people below me that I could barely see them all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The experience of declaring his accession to the throne from the castle balcony to all his subjects seemed to have helped him grow strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was wonderful, Masayuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd-san said as such as she recalled it with a wistful expression on her face. Velgrynd-san had come as Masayuki&rsquo;s chaperone, but she herself had a powerful presence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Not to mention her good looks, she looked great in her military uniform. Velgrynd-san must have been the one who drew most of the attention of the attendees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the midst of all this attention, Chairman Leicester, with his bushy white beard, came running up to us and led Masayuki and me to our seats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As befits a leading role, we were in the front row.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was seated face-to-face with Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I could also see Testarossa at the moderator&rsquo;s table.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With the arrangements in place, the historic reconciliation between the Western Nations and the Eastern Empire would go off without a hitch as long as there were no interruptions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When thinking about something like that, red flags were bound to appear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This time as well, that law would come into effect, but I didn&rsquo;t realize at the time, and simply waited quietly for the meeting to start&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Kingdom of Ingracia, the Great Underground Maze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a secret passage that had been dug for over hundreds of years. It was a facility prepared in case of the invasion of angels and was widely known as a maze because of its intricate complexity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were several large open areas in the levels near the surface which could be used by anyone as a place of refuge in case of emergency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, that was only on the surface. At the lower levels, there were secret places that only a few people knew about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was the dark side of the Royal Capital, an evil research facility that could never be revealed to the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The research there was controlled by magical inquisitors, and the content of their research was the method of incorporating the monster factor into the human body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The results of their research were still quite impressive, including muscle strength ten times greater than that of normal humans, skin tougher than steel, and skeletons to support those muscles. The result was their own bodies, but the king&rsquo;s judgment was that it was not enough to face the supernatural existence of the demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Another failure. This one&rsquo;s a little more fragile than I thought.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Khihihihihi. If we want to incarnate a greater demon, we have to make a stronger body. I heard that the Empire was developing a weapon called the Battle Chimera,</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt87" id="ftnt_ref87">[87]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and the concept is similar to ours.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. There&rsquo;s a difference between modifying the human body directly and using it as a synthetic beast.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The existence of a drug that could induce medical skills had been a closely guarded secret and was not widely known. Therefore, the researchers here believed that the synthetic beast (Battle Chimera) was the perfect weapon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, they believed that strengthening the human body directly was quicker than using synthetic beasts, and that they were superior to them. That is why, without any sense of repulsion, they were repeating experiments that would seem forbidden to ordinary people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But it was still not enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were not satisfied with the results.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Currently, they had exhausted the factors of capturable monsters, and had succeeded in extracting some factors (essences). The reinforcement rate was steadily increasing, and the model was being upgraded, but this time the vulnerability was not a physical issue but rather a mental issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It is said that a sound mind resides in a sound body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If this is true, then a strong body should be accompanied by a strong mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With this in mind, the researchers began to search for a way to fuse spiritual life forms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The quickest way to do so, they argued, would be to tap into the power of demons. The reason for this was that it was easy to obtain a body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the north, there were repeated skirmishes with demons, and lesser demons and greater demons were procured by capturing weaker ones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Such demons were lodged into dead bodies and incarnated. Thanks to these demons, they had succeeded in analyzing their composition, and discovered some interesting results.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What is the mechanism of demon incarnation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The answer to this question was that the magicules eroded human cells and transformed them to be compatible with magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, this was only the case when the demon took the initiative, and forcibly taking in the demon&rsquo;s power was nothing but a poison to the human body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was a given.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Energy intake through food, sleep, and even breathing would become unnecessary, and even life span would disappear. It would be like being reborn as a completely different life form, and to control that by human will would be the ultimate form of recklessness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides, the magical inquisitors were mistaken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They focused only on strengthening the body, while the important thing was the power of the will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They thought that only the physical body should be trained, because the mental aspect was strengthened by the demon&rsquo;s power, and so the experiments were repeated in the wrong direction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And one more thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This misunderstanding was fatal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By cultivating the cells incarnated by the demon, a factor (essence) is extracted. They thought that by injecting it, the subject would also possess the demon&rsquo;s power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was a big mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A demon took the incarnated body as its own with the power of its will. No change would come from a cell without will, only a poison that would consume the subject.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, the torturous experiments were being repeated with no hope of success.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For the subjects, this environment was hell itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is why the subjects selected were not the best people, but rather orphans and slaves who would not cause a fuss if they were disposed of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then there were the criminals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Those who had committed serious crimes were secretly executed and brought to this laboratory&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner was breathing heavily and repeatedly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Despair and fear occupied his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had fallen from the honorable position of Commander of the Knight Order of the Kingdom of Ingracia, to the status of a disposable experiment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Many of Reiner&rsquo;s beloved subordinates had been killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At first, he was angry at the injustice, but soon his heart was broken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The help he had expected did not come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner&rsquo;s family home was destroyed, and the Knight Order abandoned him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was only natural.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner had acted outrageously at a previous council meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He used Elric, the first prince of the Kingdom of Ingracia, as a motive and fought against Demon Lord Rimuru and Holy Knight Commander Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he had won, he would have been a champion, but he lost easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In such a case, Reiner had to be charged with treason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Naturally, all the people involved in Reiner&rsquo;s crime were executed. In other words, he was used as an experimental subject in this laboratory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The help that Reiner hoped for was never going to come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner understood this, and now he spent his days fearing when he would be used as experimental material.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Damn it! Why, why is this happening?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The only reason he hadn&rsquo;t completely gone insane was because his anger came back from time to time when he remembered. It was a complete resentment against Demon Lord Rimuru and against Holy Knight Commander Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">I&rsquo;ll make you weep! Even if you to beg for your life, I won&rsquo;t forgive you. I&rsquo;ll make you accept everything that happened, and then I&rsquo;ll torture you to death!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A fierce hatred was holding Reiner&rsquo;s heart together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moreover, there was another reason why Reiner had become that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was because, as of now, Reiner had only undergone physical enhancement surgery.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The plan was to strengthen him as much as possible, and then move on to the experiment of merging with the demon. In particular, Reiner was a precious specimen with an &lsquo;Over A rank&rsquo; value, so the researchers treated him with care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was doubtful whether one can could it a good fortune or not, but in any case, Reiner was still alive and well, and if one only looked at his power, it had reached Special A rank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then, on that day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A hope that was never meant to come appeared before Reiner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, I didn&rsquo;t expect it to be this easy to break in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The one who praised Vega was Feldway, who had half-heartedly entrusted Vega with guiding the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were four of them in the room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega was followed by Arios and Mai, and Feldway was at the back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After their strategy meeting, each of them made their own preparations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They all agreed not to start the attack at the same time, but to let the demon lords focus on the first attack and then hit the main target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This meant that Feldway and the others, who were aiming for Masayuki, would be a step behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn, a &ldquo;Three Star Commander,&rdquo; was to make the first attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was responsible for attracting the attention of the demon lords with his flamboyant rampage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He would defeat Dagruel, a member of the Octagram, and take control of his army. The impact would be so great that it would send chills to the hearts of the other demon lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jahil, a &ldquo;Three Star Commander&rdquo; was also assigned to assist Fenn. With this, they had assembled enough forces to bring down the west.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway and his group were the main contenders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Their goal was to go to the world conference in Ingracia&rsquo;s capital and dispose of Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In order to keep others out of the way, Zalario, a &ldquo;Three Star Commander,&rdquo; was sent to stand by in the sky to stop the Demon Lord Luminas if she made a move. Or, at Feldway&rsquo;s signal, he was to launch an all-out attack on Ingracia&rsquo;s capital.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In addition&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the same time as Fenn&rsquo;s attack was to begin, the forces of &ldquo;Insect Lord&rdquo; Zelanus were scheduled to attack the Demon Lord Milim&rsquo;s stronghold in the former Eurazania.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Currently, the six remaining &ldquo;eight stars&rdquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt88" id="ftnt_ref88">[88]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;were Guy, Rimuru, Ramiris, Milim, Dagruel, and Luminas. Since they were going to attack two of them at the same time, he hoped that it would upset the other demon lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, the Demon Lord Rimuru, who was as much a target to watch out for as Guy, was reported to be near Masayuki, whom Feldway and the others were targeting. The name had been on the list of participants for today&rsquo;s meeting, but he could not deny the possibility that this was a trap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is why Feldway was thinking of acting cautiously and responding flexibly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For this reason, he accepted Vega&rsquo;s advice and made use of the hidden passageways instead of entering the capital by force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was a good decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Located in the forest on the outskirts of the Royal Capital, was one of the exits to the passageway. By entering through there, it was very easy to get in without being affected by the Barriers that guarded the capital.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And that wasn&rsquo;t the only fortune.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, this laboratory is still active. I missed this place. I remember when they experimented on me here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega muttered such a thing, and indeed, there was a hint of human presence coming from the end of the passage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From Feldway&rsquo;s point of view, these people were all insignificant in power, but by human standards, they had a certain strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At first, he thought it would be troublesome to cause a ruckus here, but he soon realized that this was an unexpected blessing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I knew it. The people trapped in this cage are experimental subjects for our research here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As Vega explained this, he approached the cage unprotected. He then addressed the person in the cage in a friendly manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Hey, brother</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt89" id="ftnt_ref89">[89]</a></sup><span class="c1">. You doing okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The person he was speaking to was Reiner, whose heart was on the verge of breaking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&hellip;you&hellip;are not those damn researchers&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner noticed someone standing in front of the cage and cowered in fear. He looked up to see Vega, confused by the unusual situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the looks of it, you&rsquo;re pretty messed up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh, I&rsquo;m Vega. I guess you could say I&rsquo;m your senior.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Senior&hellip;you said?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m someone who was once used as a test subject here. I was lucky to escape, but it&rsquo;s still a bad memory that gives me nightmares.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Reiner became familiar with Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He felt a sense of camaraderie with Vega as someone who understood the harsh environment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are just like me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I am. So, how about I help you out?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega went off on his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway, who was listening to it all, didn&rsquo;t interfere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The mission was in Vega&rsquo;s hands, and until now, things had been going well. He thought it would be a good idea to leave things to him, and he would just keep an eye on things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides, there was another reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In addition to Reiner, there were many other prisoners here. Other experimental subjects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were nearly a hundred of them. Their bodies were similarly enhanced, and they seemed to be in good shape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, he wondered if he could use these experimental subjects for Yorishiro, a phantom who had not yet incarnated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While Feldway was pondering, Vega and Reiner continued their negotiations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner was puzzled by the unexpected news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If Vega was going to help him, then there was no way he could refuse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Vega and the others were too suspicious. He wondered if he could really trust them, though that was only for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, if he turned down their offer, all that awaited him was destruction. He would lose his mind in fear and despair and die in the not-too-distant future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would be better if he could pass away without suffering&hellip;when he thought more about it, it was much better to be deceived here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Help me. If you ask me to swear allegiance, then I will swear to give you everything I have! So take me out of here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Vega grinned and put his hand on the steel cage. Even strengthened by magic, it was easily twisted and torn apart by Vega&rsquo;s power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sheer power destroying the cage made Reiner realize the difference in rank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But what surprised him more was that there were several dead bodies of the magical inquisitors lying at his feet. They had been disposed of quickly and quietly by Arios.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner, who had been worried about the slow arrival of the patrol, turned pale when he found out the cause of the delay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">I can&rsquo;t believe that the secret forces of the Kingdom of Ingracia, to whom even I can&rsquo;t match up, were killed so easily. It&rsquo;s hard to believe, but these guys are truly monsters!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even as he was thinking this, he felt truly relieved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner knew that he had made the right choice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nice to be working with you, brother. If there&rsquo;s anyone else you want to help, let me know. I&rsquo;ll rescue all of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner&rsquo;s face flushed with joy at this unexpected offer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-Yes! All of them. All of them are my subordinates!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Only those who had been deemed to be able to withstand the enhancements were gathered here. The women and children had been sent to other experiments and were already dead. Reiner and the others who were being held here had been told this as part of their punishment. So, they chose to follow Vega without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, from now on, you&rsquo;re under my command. We&rsquo;re going to run wild in the capital up there. You&rsquo;ll follow us even if you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. Rather, it&rsquo;s a good order. We have a grudge against this country, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega&rsquo;s words were met with a happy response from Reiner. The knights under Reiner&rsquo;s command nodded with the same feeling of regret for their fallen comrades and families.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that their lives had been spared, their resentment against being used as test subjects in a horrible experiment had increased. At this moment, their anger was uncontrollable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And now, Feldway was giving them a boost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I will give you the power to do the same. Are you ready, Mai?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I have a hundred warriors from Jahil-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Following Feldway&rsquo;s wishes, Mai had already taken action. In this short time, she performed an &lsquo;Instantaneous Movement&rsquo; and had taken a selection of warriors from Jahil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jahil was not happy, but Feldway had given him an order. There was no way he could disobey, so the order was carried out swiftly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, deep underground the Kingdom of Ingracia&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The incarnation ritual was performed on Reiner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The being with the stronger will would take control of the body. In some cases, the egos would be merged, but Reiner accepted this as better than those inhumane experiments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am filled with power. Vega-sama, thank you for saving us and giving us the chance to take revenge.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem. I&rsquo;ll lend you this thing, so you can go wild!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner took the weapon from Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">It was a knight&rsquo;s sword embodied by the &lsquo;Multiple Weapons&rsquo; ability that Vega had taken from Oria. Needless to say, its performance was equivalent to a mythical-grade weapon, but Reiner, who had the power of a &ldquo;staff officer</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt90" id="ftnt_ref90">[90]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo;-class phantom, would be able to use it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The current Reiner&rsquo;s power was over a million in terms of existence value. With the addition of the mythical-grade weapon, he had been strengthened to the equivalent of two million.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner&rsquo;s subordinates had also been reborn with existence values ranging from 200,000 to 500,000, equivalent to Special A rank or higher.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega was in a good mood, having acquired an unexpected asset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway was also satisfied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">This was an unexpected pick-up. Now, go wild and do your best to help me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With a smile on his face, he watched as Reiner and the others left in high spirits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A huge tremor hit Heaven&rsquo;s Tower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">On that day, the &ldquo;Holy Void</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt91" id="ftnt_ref91">[91]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo; Damargania was on the verge of extinction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahh, that feels pretty dangerous. Could it be the one who ravaged the earth a long time ago?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hearing Ultima&rsquo;s murmur, Veyron and Zonda, who had been recalled, became tense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will go check with Dagruel-sama right away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right. We have to consider the worst-case scenario, so Zonda should run to Beretta-san&rsquo;s location now and make sure Shion-san is informed as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as they heard Ultima&rsquo;s order, Veyron and Zonda moved out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If this place were to fall, it was obvious that Lubelius with Shion would be the next target. It was natural to contact the headquarters, but it was also safe to inform Shion of the seriousness of the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perhaps because he understood this, Zonda did not argue with her at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The fact that he didn&rsquo;t say anything unnecessary such as &ldquo;why?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight with you&rdquo; was due to his absolute belief and fear in Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unlike the lower demons, those under Ultima&rsquo;s direct control understood. They understood their master&rsquo;s character.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ultima was unforgiving to those who disobeyed her, and she had no mercy for those who did not agree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And above all, Ultima&rsquo;s judgment was accurate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Zonda had tested it and found that the area had already been sealed off from magic. All means of communication had been jammed, and it was impossible to communicate with anyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of course, they were fully prepared for such a situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rimuru had instructed everyone to keep in constant contact with each other, as this was an issue that had come up during the previous attack on Leon. He told them to communicate with each other regularly, once every five minutes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This way, any point where contact was lost would be considered abnormal. So even if they didn&rsquo;t panic, others would know within five minutes that there was something going on, but Ultima must have decided that it would be too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If that was the case, then all Zonda could do was follow the orders to the best of his ability. Zonda was not so incompetent as to waste his precious time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Zonda took with the wind and disappeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ultima stood up and bit her nails.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, if my expectations are correct, should I consider running away?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ultima didn&rsquo;t want to do that, but she was determined to do so in the worst case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Rimuru-sama also believed in Dagruel. But at the same time, he had his doubts&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rimuru seemed to be a good-natured person, and it&rsquo;s true that he was gullible to a fault, but in fact, he was quite cunning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even Ultima, a king amongst demons, respected him for his calculating nature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Back then, Rimuru had muttered something casually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little curious that you&rsquo;re asking Veldora for support even after explaining the enemy&rsquo;s purpose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the Walpurgis&rsquo; banquet, Dagruel had constantly been asking Veldora to come to his aid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael was after for Veldora&rsquo;s dragon factor. Dagruel knew this, yet he still wanted Veldora to come instead of Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It made sense that it was because they knew each other, but he was still curious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s because they were familiar with each other&mdash;that was certainly convincing, but it had still bothered him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As for Ultima, she didn&rsquo;t think that Rimuru was overthinking it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After hearing Rimuru&rsquo;s story, she had finished all her thoughts about Dagruel. As a result, she had come to the same conclusion as Rimuru that the possibility of Dagruel betraying them was not zero.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">To begin with, Dagruel was born from the Mad King</span><sup class="c4 c16"><a href="#ftnt92" id="ftnt_ref92">[92]</a></sup><span class="c9 c6">&nbsp;of the Giants, wasn&rsquo;t he? He went on a world-destroying rampage, and was sealed up by Veldanava-sama&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t know the details, but could still guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To begin with, this land was adjacent to the area that was Ultima&rsquo;s territory. Naturally, Ultima knew more about Dagruel than anyone else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rimuru must have sent Ultima here in anticipation of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">It&rsquo;s easy to get excited when you think of the people who are counting on you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ultima thought of this, and upon arriving in Damargania, she had been studying Dagruel, investigating whether or not he had betrayed them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She found a clue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel was said to have three brothers, but only one younger brother was introduced to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She thought that the remaining one would be the key, but right now, a powerful presence was attacking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The presence resembled that of Dagruel and his brother, Glassord&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Mad King of the Giants.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ultima muttered, a fearless smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Veyron entered the throne room, it was filled with shouts of anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was understandable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The divine structure known as the &ldquo;Heaven&rsquo;s Tower&rdquo; had been restored to its former function. In other words, a door to the heavens had opened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Originally, the Heaven&rsquo;s Tower was a divine fortress that could protect them from any enemy. But this time, the Heaven&rsquo;s Tower had become a battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was inevitable that the people living in this land would be very upset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s more, the presence that came down from there was familiar to the old giants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even before they could see the enemy, the giants were disturbed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were many individual differences in the lifespan and abilities of giants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">First of all, there was no lifespan for the ancient individuals. They were times when they would be replaced by their successors by entrusting their memories and powers to them, but that was only a measure in case they were killed in battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Spares and replacement individuals did have lifespans, but these lifespans grew longer with each generation, and even the most recent generation had lifespans of several hundred years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And as for their abilities, the ancient individuals had powers worthy of being called gods.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Giants were huge, ranging from 2 to 2.5 meters at their normal size, but they grew several times larger in battle. The strength of their bodies was the true essence of the Giants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the case of Dagruel, the oldest of the Giants, the difference between his normal size and battle size was more than tenfold. In other words, he could grow to over 20 meters in size.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Among the Giants, there was one who was as strong as or even stronger than Dagruel. That was his younger brother, Fenn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel had three brothers, but his youngest brother was a tyrant who had lost control of his emotions while maintaining his intellect and reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was sealed away by Veldanava, and since then, Dagruel had kept the seal. That is why he had not been able to move from this land, even though his territory had been turned into a desert.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The place where Fenn was sealed was the Heavenly Star Palace. And there was only one way to get there, through Heaven&rsquo;s Tower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were other ways, but that was reserved for those who possessed the key.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, there was only one owner of the key.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Only Veldanava&rsquo;s sister, Velzard, was allowed to open the gates to the Heavenly Star Palace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel knew this, so the situation was not unexpected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel glared at the lower levels from the upper floors of the Heaven&rsquo;s Tower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It reminded him of the Walpurgis the other day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Selfish demon lords had been repeatedly asserting themselves while still being considerate of their opponents&rsquo; positions. They seemed to have no sense of cooperation, yet their opinions were strangely united.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In accordance with the terms of the agreement, Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinates had been busy coordinating the &ldquo;magic transfer circle&rdquo; until just the other day. They had now settled down, just in time for the final battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was impressed at how hard they worked, and they had done a perfect job. Dagruel was also very pleased and held a grand feast to thank the team for their hard work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now it felt a little lonely, since there was only Ultima and her friends left as their guests.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;magic transfer circle,&rdquo; which looked like an art form depending on one&rsquo;s point of view, shone brightly and sat in the center of the lower floor. However, it was its performance that was noteworthy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The purpose of the magic circle was said to be for allowing people to come and go in case of emergency, but in truth, there was no doubt that the creator had their eyes set on the distant future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although it was a makeshift project this time, Dagruel believed it to be a great enough achievement. If it could be used to move troops, it could also be used on a large number of merchants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Demon Lord Rimuru, huh. Someone who cannot be underestimated. By using the magicules in the air, he created such a complex magical device that&rsquo;s accessible to everyone. There may be a limit to the number of times one can use it but it&rsquo;s only a matter of refilling the magicule supply. It would be much safer than crossing through that magical desert.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this abandoned and dying land, it was all they could do to import enough food to satisfy their people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Giants could not live by eating nothing. They needed to eat enough food to keep up with their huge bodies, and the younger they were, the more energy they consumed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a sign of life, but in a sense, it was also a curse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They exported the materials of desert monsters and depended on the food supplies from other countries. To do this, young men and women became travelers, crossing the harsh desert over and over again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was the reality of the &ldquo;Holy Void&rdquo; Damargania.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, with this &ldquo;magic transfer circle,&rdquo; they would be free from such hardships.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Until now, it had been common knowledge that food and other things could not be teleported. But now, in the future, such problems would be solved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">It&rsquo;s scary. I never thought I&rsquo;d be able to find the solution to my problems so easily&hellip;if that&rsquo;s the case, we won&rsquo;t have to force ourselves on Lubelius.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was frightening for Dagruel to see how far off the Demon Lord Rimuru was looking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The demon lord named Rimuru, who possessed ideas that he had never thought of, was honestly amazing. He admired his recklessness and did not want to make an enemy of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, someone had come to interrupt Dagruel&rsquo;s excitement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All of a sudden, a voice echoed in his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;My friend Dagruel, it&rsquo;s been a long time. I&rsquo;m glad to hear you&rsquo;re well. I wanted to get in touch with you as soon as I got back here, but things have been crazy. I&rsquo;m glad I finally got the chance to speak with you.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel did not panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This situation had also been expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Hmm, so it&rsquo;s you, Feldway. I&rsquo;m happy that you call me a friend, but you and I are enemies now. I don&rsquo;t want to talk too long, so tell me what you want.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Upon hearing his reply, Feldway, the owner of the voice, seemed feel let down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a shame that you&rsquo;re being so cold. I was hoping to ask you to help me as well, you know?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel&rsquo;s reaction to Feldway&rsquo;s pompous tone was even colder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;The revival of Veldanava? I&rsquo;m not interested. I don&rsquo;t hold any grudge against him for sealing Fenn, and I am indebted to him for giving us this land and taking care of us, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I think it&rsquo;s right for me to help him come back.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the first place, Feldway and Dagruel were not on such good terms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rather, from Dagruel&rsquo;s point of view, he was even angry with Feldway when he heard that Michael had mental control over Dino, his true friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the time when he heard that Dino had betrayed them, he had wondered what kind of madness he had gotten into&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">To begin with, there was no way that that idiot (Dino) would voluntarily choose to betray us in such a troublesome manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And he was deeply convinced when he heard the story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why Dagruel brusquely turned down Feldway&rsquo;s offer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway was not amused by this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&lsquo;Hey now, has Dagruel the &ldquo;Rebellion</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt93" id="ftnt_ref93">[93]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo; been tamed after becoming a demon lord?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He tried to use Dagruel&rsquo;s temper to his advantage in the negotiations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">In ancient times, the &lsquo;Vicious Titans</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt94" id="ftnt_ref94">[94]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rsquo; had challenged the &ldquo;Star King Dragon&rdquo; Veldanava and had been sealed away. That was Dagruel and his two other brothers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A king of tyranny, spreading destruction across the earth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His tremendous powers of great destruction had turned many lands into scorched earth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel and the others were even called the worst gods of destruction, but they became quiet after obeying Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He lived quietly in territory he was given and guarded Heaven&rsquo;s Tower as his duty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, this did not mean that he had become quiet in nature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Even now, with his power having been sealed away by Veldanava, his rage had earned him the nickname the &ldquo;Continent&rsquo;s Wrath.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt95" id="ftnt_ref95">[95]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway thought it would be easy to provoke him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Sorry. Things are different now. I&rsquo;ve become more hopeful about the future. Considering that this is all thanks to Rimuru, I can&rsquo;t betray him.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The offer was rejected quite easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then, seeing that further negotiations would be meaningless, Dagruel said, &lsquo;The next time we meet will be on the battlefield,&rsquo; and unilaterally terminated the &lsquo;telepathic communication.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s beyond control&rsquo; Dagruel muttered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That Feldway, I can&rsquo;t believe that he unsealed Fenn. Is this because I refused to cooperate?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, Brother</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt96" id="ftnt_ref96">[96]</a></sup><span class="c1">. He is trapped in his obsession. Sooner or later, I&rsquo;m sure this would have been inevitable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Veyron looked at the brother, who was standing at ease, and expressed his displeasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey now, I can&rsquo;t just let that statement go. Has Dagruel-sama been in contact with the enemy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">This was an order from Lord</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt97" id="ftnt_ref97">[97]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ultima. Veyron pursued the matter, determined not to allow any excuses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, this ended up as a letdown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From the very beginning, Dagruel had no intention of hiding anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t be so hard on me. I&rsquo;ll admit you&rsquo;re a powerful man, but you&rsquo;re weaker than I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel replied without panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His brother, Glassord, followed suit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calm yourself, Veyron-dono. It is true that my brother received an offer from Feldway. However, he turned him down, and that is why we are here now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that admonition, Veyron nodded with a &ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had been aware of the situation to begin with because he had raised his voice to question them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The attitude of Dagruel and the others did not indicate any signs of lying, and he judged that they were telling the truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So then, why did they say something that would benefit the enemy during Walpurgis?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Our great king was concerned that Dagruel-sama&rsquo;s actions were questionable. I would like a clear explanation&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And just as Veyron was about to question him&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Well, I get it. You wanted to ask Rimuru-sama for help, didn&rsquo;t you, Uncle</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt98" id="ftnt_ref98">[98]</a></sup><span class="c1">? At Walpurgis, you wanted to make a statement that would arouse suspicion and show that you were involved with the enemy, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ultima, who had arrived late, asked Dagruel that question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or rather, it was not a question but an assertion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Dagruel smiled broadly and happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excellent! As expected of my old nemesis. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here instead of Carrera!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was Dagruel&rsquo;s true opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Carrera was too logical and wasn&rsquo;t as good at reading in between the lines.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If she had misunderstood that Dagruel was betraying her, it would have been very difficult for her to solve it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this respect, Ultima was a relief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She had been a long-time enemy of Dagruel, and he trusted her intelligence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With a big smile on his face, Dagruel told Ultima that she was right. By suggesting that he was involved with Feldway, he was suggesting that he and the &ldquo;Holy Void&rdquo; might be targeted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Like Dino, he did not want to be turned into a traitor through no fault of his own. If the possibility of that was not zero, he decided that he should tell them about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, he also felt that saying it as it was would only lead to misunderstandings, so he deliberately left it to a hint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. So that&rsquo;s what it was after all. Then, it was exactly as Uncle expected, right? Because Rimuru-sama understood exactly what was going on. Rimuru-sama is a cunning and all-seeing person, so this situation was probably part of his calculations. That&rsquo;s why, I think we can manage without worrying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ultima said with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel nodded widely and smiled with relief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You hear that, Glassord? My colleague is a remarkable guy. I knew that the man with the eye of god, who took Clayman by a storm, would see what I was up to!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ultima and Dagruel shared a heart-to-heart without Rimuru. It must have been a blessing for the both of them that they didn&rsquo;t realize that the reason for this was a complete misunderstanding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In any case, the reconciliation between the two was concluded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s do our best until Rimuru-sama comes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ultima-sama, I am at your command. I will destroy your enemies and bring them to your sight!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ultima and Veyron believed in Rimuru and went into battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, I guess I&rsquo;ll have a crack at him, too. It&rsquo;s going to be a bit of a challenge to take on Fenn, but I might be the only one who can stop him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you, Brother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Dagruel brothers were inspired by the spirit of Ultima and the others, who were supposed to be their guests.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Quickly, they all moved to intercept the attackers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Milim and her group was aware of the horizon beyond.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Karion was the first to mutter, as everyone&rsquo;s faces paled in silence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">The earth and sky were filled with swarms of insects</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt99" id="ftnt_ref99">[99]</a></sup><span class="c1">.

Even she was at a loss for words in the face of the abominable reality of those horrible insects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or perhaps she simply hated insects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Otherwise, she would not have asked Zalario to come forward to take charge of the more dangerous World-destroying Dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Regardless of such a backstory, now was not the time to be escaping reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Milim spoke up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Frey. Is it okay if I blow them up with &lsquo;Drago Nova?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Frey pondered, &ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t a bad idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera was looking at Milim expectantly, and it seemed like a good idea to allow it. If Frey had been uneasy with insects, she would have agreed to the idea without a thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Frey decided to wait.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She had no particular reason to oppose the idea, but she had a bad feeling about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose it is tactically possible to make a maximum attack on the first move. But I think it is also a good idea to expose your opponent&rsquo;s capabilities while they are still unknown.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Frey rejected Milim&rsquo;s idea, saying that it was too uncertain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With so many enemies, it would be tempting to have Milim wipe them out. However, she decided that the insectars should not be underestimated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The reason was that she knew Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Frey had fought &ldquo;Insect Queen&rdquo; Apito, but she had also observed Karion and Zegion&rsquo;s fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Apito, whom she had just barely defeated, was a fearsome majin, but to her, Zegion was like something from a whole other dimension.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This time, the enemy was the same species as Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honestly, maybe I&rsquo;m just overly concerned, but I don&rsquo;t think we should underestimate our enemy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No one laughed at Frey for being soft when she said this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the contrary, Karion agreed with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I agree with Frey. That kind of intuition is not to be taken lightly, and I myself feel that we should be cautious about what we do. I don&rsquo;t think Milim has anything to worry about, but let&rsquo;s go for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And Midley was the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, the problem is that there are so many of them, but their individual strengths are closer to B rank. If we destroy the A-ranked insects that appear to be the commanders, the rest will just be a ragtag bunch. Since the commanders&rsquo; strengths are distinct, it won&rsquo;t be difficult to find the targets. It might be easier than we think.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, he was saying something rash, based on his own brainless standards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;That is not a strategy&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Frey thought, but then she remembered that Midley&rsquo;s subordinates were used to such recklessness and swallowed her words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, we&rsquo;ll take care of the ones flying in the sky and leave the ground-crawling insectars to Midley-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Frey wrapped up the conversation as if she didn&rsquo;t care about anything else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t just leave it to Midley alone. I&rsquo;ll have my warriors take care of the commander-level enemies as well. The headless limbs will make a good training ground for the new army.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that would be very helpful. After all, it&rsquo;s not exactly right for a priest to be on the front lines.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Karion spoke as if he had no choice, and Midley agreed with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Seeing such an exchange, Obera thought to herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t just a little off, it was fundamentally wrong. But Obera wisely did not say what she thought, but only said, &ldquo;I will take care of Milim-sama&rsquo;s escort.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And finally, Milim declared with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wahahahaha! As my Four Heavenly Kings, I expect you all to do your best!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In a happy manner as always.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And again, the conversation became more relaxed, as if things were back to normal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, are you seriously saying the &lsquo;Four Heavenly Kings?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milim, you are influenced too much by Rimuru. Why don&rsquo;t you use a more normal title instead of the Four Heavenly Kings?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No! I like the Four Heavenly Kings! I&rsquo;ve always thought it was unfair that Rimuru was the only one with Four Heavenly Kings!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m fine with it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am as well. Milim-sama can do as she wants, and I will follow her wishes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As for me, I actually like it.

That&rsquo;s fine, then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the end, Frey finally broke from the line of agreements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the face of the enemies from the Otherworld, Milim&rsquo;s forces also deployed and waited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The total number of them had swelled to the largest in the Octagram, having combined three of the old demon lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Karion and Frey had evolved into the Million-class, and a reorganization was underway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Karion was appointed the General of the General&rsquo;s Army and was given command of the entire army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Frey, as Chief of the Guard, oversaw Milim&rsquo;s personal escort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Midley, as High Priest, was in charge of logistical support, leading the Warrior Priests.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera, who has recently joined the group, became the military advisor and was in charge of strategy planning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">These four were the Four Heavenly Kings of Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">The first group to be introduced was the main unit led by Karion&mdash;the &ldquo;Flying Beast Knights.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt101" id="ftnt_ref101">[101]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The leader was Suphia, and her second-in-command was Phobio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The former &lsquo;Beast Master&rsquo;s Warrior Alliance,&rsquo; a thousand members strong, was leading the remnants of Clayman&rsquo;s army and the warriors of the Beast Kingdom. The number of warriors had multiplied by a hundred, creating an army of 100,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Add to this Karion&rsquo;s command, and it made for a fearless army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Next to be introduced was &ldquo;Milim&rsquo;s Guards,&rdquo; a super-elite unit directly led by Frey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lucia and Claire acted as adjutants, providing support to Frey, the commander.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">The knights of the skies soared while riding the flying magic beasts (gryphons) that were Frey&rsquo;s tiger cubs. They numbered a little over 3,000. The team was led by Frey&rsquo;s close aides, the &ldquo;Heavenly Flying Group (Tensh&#333;sh&#363;)</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt102" id="ftnt_ref102">[102]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo; with each unit consisting of ten to thirty riders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although the gryphons were rank one magic beasts, their strength had been raised to rank by being trained by Karion. With the elite warriors of the Beast Kingdom and the &ldquo;Sky Queen&rdquo; elite guards from all over the world riding on them, their overall strength exceeded A rank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In addition, the &ldquo;Heavenly Flying Group (Tensh&#333;sh&#363;)&rdquo; members were all affected by Frey&rsquo;s awakening, and their individual strengths were equivalent to the high A ranks. There were some who were comparable to Special A rank, and they were a considerable force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this world, it was the largest army consisting of only those above A rank. Although they were only a little over 3,000 in numbers, they were fierce warriors who could easily fight in the air with high-speed maneuvers as one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Finally, the last group to be introduced were the logistical support troops that had been gathered in a hurry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although Midley was the representative, they were actually commanded by Hermes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were stray majins, human mercenaries, and Clayman&rsquo;s former subordinates. It was a mixed unit consisting of a variety of people, but they had been entrusted to Midley to assist in the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Most of them had been involved in construction work until then, and their individual strengths ranged from D rank to B rank at best. Their temperament was not suited for fighting, and their duties were to carry supplies, procure food, and assist the priests as medics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, they were numerous and numbered about 100,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was the entirety of Milim&rsquo;s force, which totaled over 200,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a formation in which the combat troops were in the front, protecting the support troops.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In addition to this, there were reinforcements from Tempest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Most conspicuous was the army led by Geld.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They had been summoned for the construction of Milim&rsquo;s castle city, but they had gone straight into the defensive battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although not all of them had been sent to support other divisions, the Yellow Numbers and the Orange Numbers totaled to 35,000 people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were a force specialized in defense, but the Yellow Numbers were particularly impressive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With Geld&rsquo;s evolution, the fighting ability of the high orcs under his command had also greatly increased, and the number of members has risen to 10,000. Some of them had even reached rank A, making them a fearsome army on average.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Orange Numbers had also gained combat experience and were now an army of warriors. Their average rank was B, and they were as strong as any knightly order. In addition, when combined with Geld&rsquo;s authority, they would serve as a shield to protect their allies with an ironclad defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This time, they would not go to the front lines, but would protect the rear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And let us not forget the &ldquo;Hiryuu&rdquo; led by Gabil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were only a hundred of them, but all of them were Special A rank which was a ridiculous force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were planning to participate in this battle in a flexible manner, going as wild as they wished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lastly, there was Carrera and Esprit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even though there were only two of them, they were still considered a formidable force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With these reinforcements, they were going to fight against the army of &ldquo;Insect Lord&rdquo; Zelanus, but it was still going to be a tough battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, the enemy numbered more than three million, more than ten times their own numbers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The wriggling insects were coming them like a gush of water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">And so, the dawn of war was about to begin.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt103" id="ftnt_ref103">[103]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">First up was Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Milim won&rsquo;t do it, then I guess it&rsquo;s my turn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And with that said, she happily stepped forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I really wanted to show them what I could do, but Frey didn&rsquo;t want me to. It can&rsquo;t be helped, so I&rsquo;ll let Carrera have this one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Milim didn&rsquo;t stop either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Before they had realized it, the two had become best friends.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt104" id="ftnt_ref104">[104]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The damage to those around them had not doubled, rather it had become immeasurable due to the synergistic effect, but that was irrelevant to the two of them. As long as they were enjoying themselves, that&rsquo;s all they cared about, and they only increased each other&rsquo;s power to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Power was strength!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And strength was destructive force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn insects, I&rsquo;ll give you annihilation! The ultimate and most powerful&mdash;&lsquo;Abyss Annihilation!!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Carrera was a master at unleashing the most powerful magic from the very first move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With this, more than two million insects were extinguished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The gap of more than ten times was now reduced to four times. Seeing this, the faces of the soldiers who had been lamenting the hopeless difference in strength were filled with hope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At first glance, Carrera&rsquo;s action may have seemed foolhardy, but it was optimal in terms of boosting morale. By reducing the enemy&rsquo;s numbers before they could inflict casualties, Carrera had kept her forces strong and increased their will to fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With this, it seemed that the battle would suddenly turn in their favor&mdash;that&rsquo;s what they thought, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Frey&rsquo;s bad premonition came true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be?!

What an absurd thing to do&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was the correct answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gabil was the only one who couldn&rsquo;t see what was going on, but that couldn&rsquo;t be helped. It was as if Carrera, who excelled in magic, was having her most powerful magic spell being thrown back at her. That was difficult to believe even if it was explained, so it would be unreasonable for one to imagine it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the first place, it was hard to believe that such imitation was even possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In any case, for now, they had no choice but to let Geld and the others do their best, and they all prepared for the impact with bated breath.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And for a few moments, there was a violent flickering of light and an impact that could turn the world upside down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It gradually converged and eventually subsided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After the tremors had died down, Carrera finally spoke up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe someone would do something like this. If this had been Milim&rsquo;s magic, I&rsquo;m not sure what would have happened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Carrera had finally calmed down, having somehow managed to erase the &lsquo;Abyss Annihilation&rsquo; she had unleashed. She then made a casual remark, but the others paled when they heard it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This time, the power had been reduced to less than thirty percent, so they were able to endure somehow. Even so, the terrain around the castle was badly damaged and the streets and other parts of the city were no longer visible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reconstructing this area would be a headache, but fortunately, no human casualties were reported.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But what if this had been &lsquo;Drago Nova?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wahahahaha! My magic is not so easy to control. It&rsquo;s possible, but I think that only some of its power would be returned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even it is only some of it, we might not be able to prevent. What is it called? That magic is based on an unknown theory. It&rsquo;s impossible to rewrite the laws, and I&rsquo;m not sure if we&rsquo;ll be able to defend ourselves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Carrera replied honestly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Carrera was good at magic, but Milim&rsquo;s magic was on another level. To be honest, the two had always competed in terms of power, so she knew better than anyone else how dangerous it was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That being the case, Gabil raised a question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If so, then wouldn&rsquo;t the enemy have been able to throw back Milim-sama&rsquo;s magic?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was a very good point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gabil was surprisingly smart and had a great sensitivity in this aspect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Milim who replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it was returned. That person has mastered &lsquo;Spatial Domination&rsquo; to great effect. It seems that she specializes in computing power, but I&rsquo;m sure that she can change the flow of any directional magic, regardless of its nature.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Carrera agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree with you. I hate to admit it, but I that think the bigger and more complex the magic, the easier it will be for her to manipulate. Even if this were a base-triggered &lsquo;Nuclear Flame,&rsquo; she&rsquo;d be able to anticipate the point of activation and cut off that space to nullify it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If it was a spell that didn&rsquo;t have a time lag, she wouldn&rsquo;t have time to pass it off, but that wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to inflict a fatal blow. Carrera felt as if she had been deprived of the demon&rsquo;s greatest asset, which was to read and fight with magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At any rate, it was annoying to have someone on the enemy side who was good at magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I apologize.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt107" id="ftnt_ref107">[107]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;If I had known more about the insectars, I could have prevented such a dangerous thing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera bowed her head in apology, but there was no one who blamed her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I guess that&rsquo;s how it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. In fact, we were able to reduce the number of enemies with zero damage, so if you only look at the results, it was a great success!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;True&hellip;since we&rsquo;re safe, there is no point in complaining, so for now, let us think about our next move.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Milim and Frey were right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was true that Carrera&rsquo;s blow had greatly reduced the enemy&rsquo;s strength, and the morale of the uninformed soldiers was high. It would be more meaningful to strike the enemy with this momentum rather than to seek blame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From now on, magic is prohibited.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No objection!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Carrera responded to Frey&rsquo;s decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, let&rsquo;s go head-to-head in a straightforward manner.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sounds like fun. I don&rsquo;t see the enemy king, but he has about eight generals. We have exactly the same number of executives as they do, so we should have a quota of one general each.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Karion expressed his opinion as a member of the Generals&rsquo; Army, Midley started saying something stupid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Carrera was in on it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, sounds interesting. Then I&rsquo;ll take the one who&rsquo;s slouching over there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The one in front of her was Zess, who was sitting on the back of a flying insectar. As the head of Insect Generals, his presence was tremendous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair! Then I&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, Milim. You are the leader, so you have to stand your ground.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. If we&rsquo;re in trouble, we&rsquo;ll need you to come in and help us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-Hmm, okay, I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Frey, who had stopped Milim from joining the fight, looked around the battlefield and declared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is why, I will deal with that flying insect.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Before her gaze was, a flying gold insect?&mdash;It was Torun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As Carrera and Frey took the lead, the rest of the group started to panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, I&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Karion, Gabil, and Midley all opened their mouths at the same time and their eyes crossed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, first come, first serve, no complaints, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve had a real fight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The same is true for me! In that case, let&rsquo;s play this game like normal!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no time to interrupt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The three of them ran out of the castle as if to restrain each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As if getting caught up in this, the army also began to move. Thus, the curtain of the great war was dropped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Geld bowed to Milim and left to take command.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The only ones left were Milim, Obera, and Esprit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Esprit is asked, she reluctantly spoke her mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To be honest, I am not good enough, so I think it&rsquo;s safer to watch the battle situation carefully and join someone else&rsquo;s support. If I overexert myself and end up losing, I&rsquo;ll only be dragging us down&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a very wise decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For once, Esprit was not slacking off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. If you underestimate the Insect Generals, you&rsquo;ll get hurt. I don&rsquo;t have much experience in fighting them, but I know that they&rsquo;re not ones to be taken lightly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, many of her friends had been killed by insectars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In particular, the one named Zess, whom Carrera was headed towards, was said to be a challenge even for Zalario. In all honesty, Obera herself could not be sure that she would win against him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Therefore, the three remaining members decided to wait and see how the battle would go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Carrera, who had taken the lead, was the first to meet the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A hindrance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And with that, she beat up and killed a bunch of enemies at once, running across the battlefield. At the other end of the field, she fired her Golden Gun at Zess, who was standing calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But Zess easily avoided it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even a supersonic bullet at close range was nothing more than an insignificant toy to Zess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, you&rsquo;re not bad.&rdquo;<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Carrera was impressed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She transformed the Golden Gun into a military sword with a golden blade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Carrera. The one who will reap your life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nonsense. Such a joke, you&rsquo;ll have to wait until I&rsquo;m on my feet before you can talk like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With those words, the battle had begun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Frey jumped out at the same time as Carrera, and without waiting for orders, the &ldquo;Heavenly Flying Group (Tensh&#333;sh&#363;)&rdquo; surrounded her. Naturally, &ldquo;Milim&rsquo;s Guards&rdquo; followed suit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were not entirely dedicated to escorting Milim, but this was not a problem because their roles changed in wartime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the first place, Milim did not need guards. Now that Obera was still there, Frey could rampage without worry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, while kicking flying insects to the curb, Frey made contact with Torun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Torun was an Insect General with a shiny metallic exoskeleton to protect himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was stocky and not very smart. Looking closer, he was surprisingly large, reaching a height of two meters. However, he was a powerful creature that should not be underestimated. By using his two pairs of wings like a dragonfly, he was able to freely fly in a variety of ways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Frey realized that Torun was troublesome when he evaded her just as she thought she had struck her first blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Torun had dodged her claws from a high-speed flight while still staying in the air. This was due to the difference in the way they flew, and Torun seemed to have the advantage in aerial combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Torun&rsquo;s compound eyes could catch Frey&rsquo;s movements as if they were in slow motion. Although Torun was inferior to Frey in terms of straight-line speed, he could easily predict where Frey would move, making evasion a simple matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Torun did not possess any special skills. His power was divided between the strength of his exoskeleton, predicting the future, and his flight speed. Although simple, Torun had a very strong ability composition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">In particular, the nature of its fists was a special bio-organic steel material called &ldquo;alionium</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt108" id="ftnt_ref108">[108]</a></sup><span class="c1">,&rdquo; and its strength surpassed even that of adamantite. It was strong enough to reach the mythical-grade level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Equipped with all the important elements of combat&mdash;reaction speed, defense, and offense&mdash;Torun was inferior to Frey in terms of existence value, but superior in terms of combat ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Frey, who had planned to take out the enemy general at full speed, was about to suffer a major miscalculation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Torun made a mistake at this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kishi, Kishishishishi. You, slow. Me, fast.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With this single comment, Frey lost her temper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Milim would speak of this later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Frey was by no means a mild-mannered person. Anyone who made stupid remarks would soon learn firsthand how foolish they were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because Milim was always being scolded, her words carried a lot of weight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And Torun would soon understand the meaning of these words with his own flesh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gabil was following Frey with the &lsquo;Hiryuu&rsquo; in tow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone, the enemy is an insectar, the same species as Zegion-dono and Apito-dono. I think you all understand how strong they are, but you must not let your guard down!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s loud warning was met with wide nods from his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They had always been beaten severely during their training in the labyrinth. Everyone was aware of the danger and remained overly vigilant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kakushin, Sukerou, and Yashichi followed Gabil as he swept away the swarm of insects that filled the sky with his breath.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, hey, Gabil-sama! Are you going to help Frey-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm? If she&rsquo;s struggling, then I&rsquo;d be happy to help&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gabil seemed uncomfortable with Yashichi&rsquo;s question. He thought that Frey would not be pleased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rather, there was someone else he was worried about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm, Gabil-sama, there&rsquo;s someone over there who seems dangerous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Sukerou had discovered the person Gabil had been worried about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. He looks vaguely like Apito-dono, but I sense a more vicious presence!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And Kakushin responded with a similar reaction to Gabil&rsquo;s concern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, Gabil had also perceived his existence to be a greater threat than Apito.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Apito&rsquo;s existence value was lower than Gabil&rsquo;s, but when it came to combat, they were practically even. His odds of winning were not that high, and he was always forced to fight his hardest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet, the presence of this creature was more frightening than Apito.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s instincts told him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This guy is dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The creature&rsquo;s name was Beathop. He was an Insect General with the characteristics of a bee and a grasshopper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gabil was at a loss as to what to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even if it was only him, he would still be in a position to take care of the lives of his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because Rimuru had ordered him not to die, he felt that he should not try to fight a battle that he could not win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although he had been carried away by Karion&rsquo;s and Midley&rsquo;s enthusiasm, Gabil was not that much of a fighter. He wanted to test his skills as a warrior, but he did not want to fight for his life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Besides, if I were to get seriously injured here, Souka might shut me out. I made her cry the last time, and it is unimaginable how much trouble I had to go through to get her to change her mood&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gabil wept over the bitter memories.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was such a thing as battle compatibility, so there was no need to give up the advantage of being able to fly. He didn&rsquo;t need to go to the trouble of challenging a dangerous opponent here, so he could just find an easier opponent to beat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gabil thought as such and went to find another general&mdash;However, that was too naive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t run away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Beathop was a formidable Insect General.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In an instant, he had closed the distance between them and was floating in front of Gabil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gabil was able to react to Beathop&rsquo;s kick a moment later because he was accustomed to Apito&rsquo;s speed. In addition, the Vortex Spear had been raised to a mythical-grade performance level and was able to withstand the kick.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Beathop, like Torun, also had the exoskeleton of his limbs turned into alionium.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The same was true of the vital parts of his head and torso.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had a slender body, and his flight speed exceeded that of Torun&rsquo;s. He was an Insect General with cheat-like combat abilities. While his defense was equal to Torun&rsquo;s, his attack was greater than his.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even if they were to simply compare existence values, he was superior to Gabil. Frey would have been a more fitting opponent, and it was a heavy load for Gabil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, in this situation, there was no way to escape. The only way to survive was to fight and win, and Gabil had made up his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is no shortage of opponents! My name is Gabil! I have been entrusted with the title of &ldquo;Dragon Lord&rdquo; by Rimuru-sama!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gabil said as such and confronted Beathop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Karion ran across the land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was followed by an Insect General whose back was covered with spider-like limbs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My name is Abart. You, I kill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Spit it out. Don&rsquo;t talk about things you can&rsquo;t do!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As they ran, a battle was raging between them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The divine Karion&rsquo;s strength was not half bad. If it had been a one-on-one match without thinking about the future, he would have already unleashed a Burst Roar and defeated Abart long ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was not the case because this was a battlefield. There were other Insect Generals in the area, and he couldn&rsquo;t show them his secret moves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides, unlike in the labyrinth, death was the end. The most important thing in a battle was to survive, so he had to find a way to fight without overworking himself while also preserving his strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He made this decision because he thought that his opponent was a lower rank than him. In the face of a truly powerful opponent, Karion would have given it his all without thinking about the consequences.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But instinctively, Karion did not doubt his victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Abart&rsquo;s existence value was less than half of Karion&rsquo;s. Like the other Insect Generals, Abart had a combat-focused ability structure, but so did Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this battle, Karion had the advantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The one Midley encountered was Saril, whose body was drenched in a seemingly poisonous liquid. Needless to say, his reddish-purple exoskeleton was made of alionium. And from his tail oozed a deadly poison that would kill anybody who touched it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The poisonous scorpion (Sasori), Saril.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a difficult opponent for those who excelled in hand-to-hand combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that didn&rsquo;t apply to Midley.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s a problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Kekeke.

You seem to be mistaken, so I&rsquo;ll tell you, but in a battle, luck is not a factor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;It is true that there are phenomena in the world such as lucky punches and giant killings</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt110" id="ftnt_ref110">[110]</a></sup><span class="c1">, with lower-ranked fighters defeating higher-ranked fighters. However, such feats are the result of hard work, and they are achieved by those who have honed their own unique weapons that can be used against their superior. It is not worth the effort if something like that is reduced to mere luck, is it not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you trying to say, bastard?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, I&rsquo;ll put it simply. I am strong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And as soon as he said that, Midley disappeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, rather&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With an &lsquo;Instantmove&rsquo; that Saril&rsquo;s perception could not catch, he closed the distance in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Saril was blown away, the result of Midley&rsquo;s fist smashing into his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, it hurts a little, but you get used to it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Midley&rsquo;s fist was smoking purple as he muttered this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Saril&rsquo;s poison. Midley&rsquo;s entire body was covered in a protective barrier of energy from the &lsaquo;Battlewill&rsaquo;. The poison was so deadly that it could have corroded it, but Midley didn&rsquo;t care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wh-What the hell is wrong with you?! You&rsquo;ve been poisoned by me, and you don&rsquo;t give a damn&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fighting spirit. If I couldn&rsquo;t do this much, I wouldn&rsquo;t be Milim-sama&rsquo;s sparring partner!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Midley shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Regardless of the logic, it was loud enough to upset Saril.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At first glance, Midley didn&rsquo;t look very strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So Saril was confused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">No, that&rsquo;s crazy! There&rsquo;s no way he can hit my exoskeleton with his bare hands and be safe. So then, what the hell is going on?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Despite his thoughts, Saril still believed his victory to be unwavering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no way that a mere fragile human could harm him, an Insect General.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was naive thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Midley.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although he may look human, his true nature was of a true dragonewt, like Gabil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moreover&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Normally, Midley completely concealed his abilities with &lsaquo;Battlewill&rsaquo;, but his existence value was actually twice that of Gabil&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, against Saril, Midley would show his true colors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Geld returned to the front and spoke to his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Our job is to make sure no enemies get through.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All the generals responded to Geld&rsquo;s order with great enthusiasm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no fear on their faces, and they looked coldly at the approaching enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The enemy forces were of various shapes and sizes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They looked as if they have been transformed into monsters by incorporating the features of large insects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were few humanoid forms, but strangely enough, the closer they looked to human form, the stronger they seemed to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At that moment, Geld&rsquo;s gaze settled on a single point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A figure was sitting on the back of a huge centipede, over thirty meters in length. Judging by the overwhelming presence, he guessed that it was definitely one of the Insect Generals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will deal with him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Geld muttered, and several of his subordinates nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With those voices at his back, Geld took a step forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Esprit picked up her sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Milim called out to her as she headed to the window.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, yes. Carrera-sama seems to be struggling, so I thought I&rsquo;d help out even in a small way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Esprit replied in a casual tone, as if she was going for a walk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As she observed from there, Insect General Zess, who was dealing with Carrera, had a fearsome fighting ability. Moreover, Peliod was blocking Carrera&rsquo;s magic, and she was on the defensive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She could no longer stand idly by and watch just because she was weak. Therefore, Esprit took out her hidden sword without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a sword forged by Kurobee, and it was a legendary-grade weapon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Esprit, who had always believed that anything other than magic was useless to a demon, was now learning to use a sword in secret.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Esprit&rsquo;s boss, Carrera, was addicted to this hobby, so she wanted to keep that in mind as a subordinate. And more than that, the experience of fighting with Agera had caught Esprit&rsquo;s interest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Esprit thought it would be interesting for a demon to specialize in swordsmanship and began to secretly work on the development of magic swordplay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t really ready for actual use, but now was not the time for that. Peliod&rsquo;s anti-magic ability was so great that Esprit could not penetrate it. It was a humiliating fact, but it was true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, she decided to use her magic sword instead of magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, the enemy doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about one-on-one, so we have to make a move, right? That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to head out for a while!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Milim smiled as she said so cheerfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm, go and do your best!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, with Milim seeing her off, Esprit set off for the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, only Milim and Obera remained in the castle tower of Frey&rsquo;s prided skyscraper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here, Obera opened her mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, Milim-sama, I will head on out as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm? You&rsquo;re not hurt anymore?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am sorry to have caused you concern. I am already healed, so please do not worry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so stubborn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera chuckled when she heard Milim&rsquo;s exasperated voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my nature. And, as you may have already noticed&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm. It&rsquo;s the source of that sticky feeling enveloping the battlefield, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera nodded, her expression tightening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Insect Lord&rsquo; Zelanus is incredibly strong. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m no match for him, so please be very careful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In truth, it would be best if Milim never had to come into play. However, Obera guessed that if Zelanus made a move, there would be nothing they could do to stop him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, although unwillingly, they had no choice but to rely on Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Therefore, she wanted to reduce the number of the enemy generals as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just now, Obera&rsquo;s eyes had caught sight of a single, free-roaming Insect General&mdash;It was Tishorn with both hands turned into sharp blades. She thought she should take them out and use the momentum to cover the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, it was a race against time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She wanted to take out as many generals as possible before Zelanus could move. However, the enemy&rsquo;s strength was too unknown for that to be easy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From what I can tell, there are some dangerous ones out there. Obera, please help me get them all back safely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;By your will!&rdquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt111" id="ftnt_ref111">[111]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Obera was filled with elation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How pleasant it was to be commanded by her lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unlike the previous battles where she had fought out of a sense of duty, this time she felt as if her strength was swelling from the bottom of her heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">I see, I wonder if it was the same for all of you?

Until the machine was repaired, all other work would be stopped&hellip;and that was the moment I knew I would have to work overtime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After giving instructions to arrange for night lighting, I contacted the relevant authorities such as the municipal office and the police, explained the situation, and completed the work that I could do by myself. I didn&rsquo;t have time to mourn as I went around explaining the situation to the local residents as necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had so much to do that I found myself working long past regular working hours.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What I am feeling now was just like what I had been feeling back then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, I had to give up seeing Hinata&rsquo;s dress.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If we had to invade two places at the same time, we would have to be prepared for a long battle. It would be impossible to finish the job by nightfall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was a high possibility that one of the battlefields was a decoy, and there was no way to deal with it in a euphoric mood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, I decided to never forget the resentment that was welling up in my heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had to teach those fools that taking away my fun time came at a steep price&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that in mind, I changed my mindset and began thinking of countermeasures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata noticed the change in me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I nodded and explained briefly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, the enemy is on the move. It looks like something&rsquo;s going on over here too&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;ll take care of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s Hinata for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t even have to ask her, she just agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Testarossa, I need you to cooperate with Hinata and take care of the situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For the time being, I decided to get a situation report from Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Benimaru, how&rsquo;s the follow-up going?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m checking, but it looks like the situation is pretty bad.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He responded without panic, but the situation seemed to be quite tense. I waited for the rest of the report, hoping that the damage was not worse than expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve received word. Surprisingly, both forces are evenly matched. It seems that Carrera&rsquo;s supreme magic was the beacon that started the war, but there was someone on the enemy side who could throw it back, and it turned into a head-on collision&mdash;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Throwing back Carrera&rsquo;s magic?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was wondering how a spell with such crazy power could be thrown back, but was it possible with the &lsquo;Spatial Domination&rsquo; ability?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;It depends on one&rsquo;s computing power, but it is possible. It also depends on the scale and power of the spell being thrown, but if it&rsquo;s a directional destructive spell, it is possible to channel the power by distorting space. If a mistake is made, your own allies will be harmed, so it is not recommended.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you take too much time to predict the point of impact, your teammates may get caught.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And if the prediction fails, needless to say, you will be hit hard. I suppose Ciel-san can do it, but unless there was no other way, it would be rejected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you think of it that way, it&rsquo;s a strategy built on the sacrifice of your allies, and the risk of failure is too great, making the enemy seems like a very daring gambler.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, because of that, it became a head-on collision, and the enemy had eight Insect Generals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The official name of the group was the &ldquo;Twelve Insect Generals,&rdquo; but now there are only eight Insect Generals left, not twelve, so the group was all together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In addition to this, there was the presence of the &ldquo;Insect Lord&rdquo; Zelanus, and Milim could not move. Therefore, the &lsquo;Milim Four Heavenly Kings&rsquo; and even Carrera and the others all joined in to fight the Insect Generals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s with the &lsquo;Milim Four Heavenly Kings&rsquo;?&mdash;putting aside the question, I was amazed that even the number was the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;So, do you think we can win?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but I&rsquo;m sure there will be some tough opponents.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;All right. In any case, let&rsquo;s send reinforcements.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve already sent out 300 Kurenai in anticipation of that.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oh, I knew Benimaru was great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t waste any time and acted quickly and decisively.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;magic transfer circle&rdquo; could only transfer about fifty people at a time, but if we replenished the magicule ourselves, we could operate continuously. In addition, since there were plenty of magicules in our labyrinth, the time required to reuse them would be short.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With Veldora&rsquo;s help this time, we were able to send 300 people out safely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gobua, the commander, was also very motivated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;It seems that she has been dating Phobio for some time and was burning up about her lover&rsquo;s crisis. Well, I don&rsquo;t think she will fall behind so easily.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s fine, but I&rsquo;m worried if they&rsquo;ll have enough forces.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When you hear that the number of enemies exceeds one million, it&rsquo;s natural to worry with only three hundred additional people. The quality of the individual people was very good, as they were all of Over A rank. However, if they made a series of mistakes due to fatigue, it would not be surprising for them to collapse at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Do you want me to send Gobta?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hmm, a hundred Goblin Riders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Our country was guarded by the labyrinth, and Gobta and the others had no business there. Or rather, I didn&rsquo;t want them to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Goblin Riders were more suited to a wide battlefield. If we let them fight in the labyrinth, it meant that we were in a very tight situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In that case, it&rsquo;s probably not a good idea to leave anything out here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s do that. Ranga, you go with Gobta and protect him!&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Understood!!&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ranga&rsquo;s presence disappeared from my shadow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just as I was feeling relieved, I heard Benimaru laughing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Fufu, Rimuru-sama still has a soft spot for Gobta as usual.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Eh, is that so?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Yeah. He&rsquo;s a great leader too, so there&rsquo;s no need to worry so much about him.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;But you know, he&rsquo;s a little off sometimes, right?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Hahaha, he usually is, but on the battlefield, he&rsquo;s serious. But well, perhaps it&rsquo;s better to be overprotective this time&hellip;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s happy mood had changed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It seems that he sensed something disturbing about the enemy&rsquo;s behavior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Which means, even in your estimation, the enemy is strong, right?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s unsettling. I&rsquo;m &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; them through Geld&rsquo;s eyes, but the insects have no fear. They are tireless and continue to attack over the dead bodies of their own comrades.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s a nasty enemy&hellip;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Geld says it reminds him of the time when they were under the control of his father (their lord).&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Ah, the Unique Skill &lsquo;Starved&rsquo;&hellip;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was more of a bad memory than a nostalgic one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But the image came through clear enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Anyway, I pray for everyone&rsquo;s safety. You keep watching, and if the worst happens, don&rsquo;t hesitate to go for backup.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I understand.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that, I ended the conversation with Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ramiris was the next person I contacted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Well, did you get any response?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Hold on a second.

Now then, this guy, she skipped her training, didn&rsquo;t she?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right. I trusted Treyni-san and Beretta&rsquo;s handling of the situation, but I had a feeling that it was wrong to put Ramiris in command&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Can you put Beretta on for me?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Oh, wait a minute. You have to trust me&mdash;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Never mind that.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She switched speakers without saying a word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not that I was dragging the Hinata situation behind me, and it&rsquo;s not that I was taking it out on her, but this was an emergency situation. It was not a game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, I would hear from Beretta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I just received a call from Zonda-dono. They have escaped to the callable area under Ultima-sama&rsquo;s orders.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s Ultima for you. Unlike a certain slack-jawed fairy, she acted according to the manual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;So, what about the enemy?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;They&rsquo;re terrifyingly powerful, we&rsquo;re asking for urgent support&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what they said. What should we do? Would it be better to request the other demon lords to return our forces?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hmm, that was a good suggestion, but I was concerned about the fact that they were so powerful. If we were to move our troops, there was a high possibility that we would fall into the enemy&rsquo;s trap, and if possible, I wanted to keep our forces at a minimum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Before that, Ingracia was the dominion of Luminas. We could not borrow from Luminas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Leon had fallen into the hands of the enemy and Guy did not want to move from his guard of El Dorado. Regardless of whether Velzard attacked, I felt that it was a good idea to leave him there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If that was the case, I was the only one left who could put up a fight&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I wondered what to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Should I send out the labyrinth team, or should I go myself?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was worried about here as well, but I didn&rsquo;t feel any big presences. Testarossa was also here, and Hinata and the Holy Knight Order were also in motion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They could expect reinforcements from Luminas if necessary, and above all, Velgrynd-san was here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In that case&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Ah, Rimuru-sama! I have more information on the enemy&rsquo;s forces. They have confirmed the appearance of Dino-dono and Leon-dono!&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I heard that, my mind was made up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If Leon was there, I had to be the one to go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now there was no more hesitation. I should follow the manual and have Leon returned to our side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, I still had lingering doubts, but I decided to turn them into anger and take them out on the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll head out. I&rsquo;ll leave the command there to Benimaru, so tell Ramiris to take her training seriously.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;&mdash;Understood.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Beretta seemed to express an almost sad feeling, but I got the point. I&rsquo;m not saying that she (Ramiris) shouldn&rsquo;t play commander, but she would have to learn the manual properly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think that it might have been a mistake to make the &ldquo;Control Room&rdquo; more luxurious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I recreated it from my memory and made it as gorgeous as one from any anime or manga. I wasted so much money on it that everyone wanted to sit in the commander&rsquo;s chair, which was annoying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had even prepared a special seat for Ramiris, so she was already in the mood&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would be fine if we were just playing around, but this was a serious battle. I gave her a firm warning to fulfill her duty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A gentleman stood before Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Fenn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The reason why he looked so gentlemanly was because it was in comparison to Dagruel. Fenn was slender yet tall like a giant, and his supple muscles were toned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His skin was white. It was morbidly white, having been depigmented by isolation in a sunless room for an uncanny number of years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His green hair was long and shaggy, and his eyes shone like jade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He wore a long, loose robe with an open bust. Accentuating his appearance were the chains wrapped around his waist and shoulders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">The Gleipnir</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt112" id="ftnt_ref112">[112]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;that had bound him for years was now Fenn&rsquo;s favorite.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With an elusive movement, Fenn walked towards Dagruel, his body swaying back and forth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At first glance, he seemed defenseless, but that was not the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was moving like a martial arts master, ready to respond to any attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn smirked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you, Brother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn called out to him, and Dagruel let out a big sigh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that I missed you, but I never wanted to see you again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, come on, don&rsquo;t say such lonely things. It&rsquo;s only us three brothers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so sorry that we went down the wrong path.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh! You&rsquo;ve changed, Brother. You used to be such a cool guy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn responded with a disgruntled look.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To Fenn, Dagruel was his idol.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But now, he felt that Dagruel has lost his fangs and was no longer interesting to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We once stood up against Veldanava-sama. And now we know the reality.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your excuse, isn&rsquo;t it Brother? I don&rsquo;t accept that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nonsense! We&rsquo;re only alive because of his kindness!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing, I don&rsquo;t like my brother being such a coward! And what about Veldanava? If Feldway resurrects Veldanava, then I&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;s better, black and white.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You idiot!! You don&rsquo;t know who he is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Enough of this argument. It&rsquo;s all pointless</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt113" id="ftnt_ref113">[113]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;anyway. Now then, let&rsquo;s fight. I&rsquo;ll beat you and wake you up, Brother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fenn, you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Both Fenn&rsquo;s and Dagruel&rsquo;s bodies were engulfed in a swirling fighting spirit. Under the tremendous pressure, the Heaven&rsquo;s Tower, which should be indestructible, shook violently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The next moment, Dagruel&rsquo;s fist plunged into Fenn&rsquo;s face with an impact that seemed to pierce the earth and sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Fenn held his ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then, in return, he squatted down deeply and delivered a heavy, sharp uppercut into Dagruel&rsquo;s stomach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel&rsquo;s body flew helplessly in the air, but Fenn seized the moment and threw a kick to his legs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The impact of Dagruel&rsquo;s massive body hitting the wall made the Heaven&rsquo;s Tower creak as if it were about to collapse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But Dagruel got up as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tch, I see that your skills haven&rsquo;t dulled.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same with brother. Any normal person would&rsquo;ve been done by now, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate me. The name &ldquo;Octagram&rdquo; is something to live up to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You seem to like it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quite a bit, yeah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as he replied, Dagruel unleashed the full power of fighting spirit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel had an existence value of over 40 million. Although Fenn&rsquo;s existence value was greater, his pressure was also comparable to that of the True Dragons&mdash;The battle was left to each side&rsquo;s abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Leon quietly stepped onto the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Standing in front of him was Dagruel&rsquo;s younger brother and Fenn&rsquo;s older brother, Glassord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was about two meters tall, large by other races&rsquo; standards but small by Giants&rsquo; standards. His skin color was yellow, somewhere between that of his older and younger brothers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">His eyes were purple and had an intellectual glow to them. He had the tendency to believe that he must remain open-minded</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt114" id="ftnt_ref114">[114]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;because of the hardships he had suffered as a result of being sandwiched between his unrestrained older brother and free-spirited younger brother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was aware of this, but he could not help his innate temperament.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It is for this reason that Glassord used a two-handed sword (Greatsword), a weapon that emphasized technique, which was unusual for Giants who exceled in bare-handed or clubbed weapons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He did not carry a shield and his fighting style was completely offensive, but that was a sign of his confidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although Glassord&rsquo;s existence value was just under 2 million, and although he seemed fragile compared to his brothers, he was undoubtedly a million-class competitor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And his skill-level was the highest among the three brothers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are Demon Lord Leon-dono, I presume. My name is Glassord. I am the second-in-command of the Titan Corps. I would have preferred to test my skills against you when you were not being deprived of your free will, but that will have to wait for another time&mdash;I will give up the win for today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that, Glassord stepped in front of Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The gentlemanly Veyron stood in front of the languid Dino.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Veyron was a duke-class demon peer, second in rank only to Grand Duke Moss. However, he had to admit that his odds were not just a little, but very bad against a pillar of the &lsquo;originals&rsquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt115" id="ftnt_ref115">[115]</a></sup><span class="c6">, which was comparable to the primordials</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt116" id="ftnt_ref116">[116]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Still, this was better than his master who was dealing with two such &lsquo;originals&rsquo; at the same time, and he intended to fulfill his role to the fullest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was, to buy time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">&ldquo;Dino won&rsquo;t take things seriously anyway, so I think you can be a match for him. If I come out, Dino might get serious. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll leave this to you, Veyron.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When asked so adorably, Veyron had no way to refuse. In order to live up to his master&rsquo;s expectations, he was determined to give it his all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I guess I have to fight too&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d be willing to stall for time, I&rsquo;d be more than happy to do so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m not even allowed to slack off right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what Dino said, but he was still trying to figure out how much was acceptable. It was frustrating that he couldn&rsquo;t say that, but he was relieved that he could say the following line.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, Ultima is one thing, but I&rsquo;ll take you on with swordplay alone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, he was declaring that he wouldn&rsquo;t use his skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He knew from Leon&rsquo;s battle that he didn&rsquo;t need to fight with all his might. If Leon had been serious, the battle would have been much more intense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino had once witnessed Leon&rsquo;s true fighting style. The flash of his sword was like light and had the power to slice through even the spirit. As far as he remembered, he did not believe that the current Leon was serious at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why Dino also imitated him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;This is not slacking off, rather it is a way of not betraying my friends&rsquo;&mdash;that is what Dino told himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Observing Dino&rsquo;s behavior, Veyron also understood. He was a demon who was very sensitive to the subtleties of people and their emotions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Hmm. As Ultima-sama predicted, Dino-sama does not seem enthusiastic about this battle. If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;m sure I can be a worthy enough opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Once he understood that, the decision was easy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Pretending to be challenged by Dino and fight back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been taken for a fool. Then, allow me to break your arrogant nose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Saying this, Veyron performed a change with his Ultimate Gift &lsquo;Artist.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The figure he imitated was, of course, the youthful form of Byakuya Araki, Agera&rsquo;s former life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In his hand was a sword forged by Kurobee. It was a legendary-grade work of art, made to resemble a walking stick.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, Kurobee had improved his skills since he arrived here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As shown by the sword he had given to Esprit, he had become an incredibly skilled swordsmith, with seven or eight of his ten swords being legendary-grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">In fact, it would not be long before he would reach the level of a &ldquo;divine craftsman</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt117" id="ftnt_ref117">[117]</a></sup><span class="c1">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kurobee&rsquo;s sword fit well in Veyron&rsquo;s hand. Veyron was beginning to understand the appeal of swords, though only when using the Ultimate Gift &lsquo;Artist.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Interesting. I&rsquo;ll take it a little seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was a lie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino&rsquo;s eyes were flickering with anxiety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">You&rsquo;re okay, right? You understand what I&rsquo;m trying to say, don&rsquo;t you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was desperately asking that question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Veyron nodded broadly as if to reassure him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your word for it. Take it easy on me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And with that, he made Dino smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In front of Pico and Gracia, Ultima stood alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, hey, Violet Primordial. No, it&rsquo;s Ultima now. I&rsquo;m sure you understand the situation, but are you sure you want to take on the both of us by yourself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gracia asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ultima responded with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not an issue. As for me, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, you guys are just the right amount to get used to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm, hmm&hellip;we&rsquo;ve been taken as fools&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pissed off too. I won&rsquo;t forgive you even if you cry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unlike with Dino and Veyron, the conflict here was quite serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rather, Ultima was even enjoying the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She had assessed Pico and Gracia&rsquo;s fighting ability and concluded that they were weaker than her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She was right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Pico and Gracia were not weak, and were of course million-class, but their existence values were around 2 million, a step below Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On top of that, Ultima had the rare experience of having fought to the death against a competitor of equal ability (Damrada). This fact confirmed Ultima&rsquo;s confidence, and she thought that these two would be the perfect test for her to hone her skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I hit you, maybe you&rsquo;ll get your free will back, so I&rsquo;ll cooperate with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of thing that never works.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s none of your business!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While exchanging such casual remarks, the head-on collision began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The battle between Dagruel and Fenn was, to the casual observer, extremely intense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But in reality, neither of them was serious. If they had been, everyone in the area would have been put under the pressure of their fighting spirit, and some of them might not have been able to even stand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the very least, it would have been less of a battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But the time for observation would soon be over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The other groups did not want to fight in the small building and moved to their own battlefields.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a result, Dagruel and Fenn were the only ones left in the multi-storied Heaven&rsquo;s Tower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve been this heated. Brother, I&rsquo;m about to get serious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph! That&rsquo;s what I want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn&rsquo;s fighting spirit swelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His power, rivaling that of the True Dragon, exerted a visible pressure on Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Dagruel was not to be defeated either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nnngh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And, by letting his own fighting aura permeate his body, he transformed his muscles into something specialized for combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was the start of a full-scale battle between the two brothers, and each of their goals was non-negotiable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn wanted the Dagruel of his rampaging days back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel, on the other hand, was seeking stability and order. He was willing to go to war if necessary, but he was not willing to go to war in vain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They had incompatible goals. However, the winner of this fight would be able to make his opponent follow their wishes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The battle would intensify.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, little by little, Fenn gradually began to gain the upper hand in what had been a tight competition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The difference in strength was apparent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In addition to that, the decisive factor was the Gleipnir, a chain that Fenn could control at will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Veldanava had created it with his own hands, and it was an indestructible chain that boasted strength and flexibility above even the mythical-grade. Fenn had been bound by it for so many years that he had come to be able to control Gleipnir as if it were a part of his own body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuh, you&rsquo;re so cocky&hellip;you&rsquo;ve gained even more strength than before to have pushed me so far like this&mdash;Eh?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel was caught off guard and had his hands and feet twisted together by Gleipnir.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had an expression of anguish on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn smirked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Brother&mdash;you&rsquo;d better accept the memories of the pain I deeply experienced!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And with that, he delivered a powerful headbutt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A moment later, Dagruel and Fenn&rsquo;s souls touched, and their memories and emotions crossed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What resulted from this was the sharing of memories.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a result&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel remembered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you remember now, Brother?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, I feel like I&rsquo;m awake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, well that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fenn&rsquo;s smile deepened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He then offered his hand to his brother Dagruel in a gesture of affection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That hand was clasped tightly&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, it&rsquo;s time to fight. Let&rsquo;s show the world the might of our Titan Army!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course! As expected of Brother, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagruel shouted, and Fenn smiled happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The member of the Octagram, and the giant demon lord who guarded the Heaven&rsquo;s Tower, was no more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The ancient evil deity had returned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Under Dagruel&rsquo;s command, the Giant warriors had all been summoned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Titan Army was renamed the &ldquo;Binding Chain Titans.&rdquo; And they began their march into the barren desert to recreate the tyranny of ancient times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was not an orderly movement at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Each of them took their own weapons as they saw fit and acted in accordance with the orders of the king, Dagruel. Thus, without any preparation time, the collective action was completed with a speed that could make a mockery of the military organization.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even Glassord, who had been in league with Leon, was no exception.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, it seems that the reason for hostility has disappeared. From now on, I will be your comrade in battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as he said this to Leon, Glassord left the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Leon dealt with this unperturbed. It had been the expected conclusion if Fenn won.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Seeing this, Ultima felt like crying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on, are you kidding me? No matter how much stronger I&rsquo;ve gotten, this is just too much&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She was tempted to complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, the number of allies had decreased, and the number of enemies had increased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was exactly the strategy that Rimuru had been aiming for, and now the enemy was trying to pull it off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fortunately, Dagruel, who was now the enemy, ignored Ultima and the others and started to advance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, she shouldn&rsquo;t take that as a blessing, but she couldn&rsquo;t help but think that they were lucky, because if they had been targeted right now, they would have been defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In any case, the situation was terrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even Veyron, who had fought evenly against Dino, could not hide his impatience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ultima-sama, what should we do? We&rsquo;re running out of time, and I wonder if it&rsquo;s best to start all over again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Not fearing Ultima&rsquo;s displeasure, he even suggested so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Without complaining about this, Ultima fell silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She was thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;ve definitely gotten stronger. I&rsquo;ll give you that. But with Dagruel joining us, you won&rsquo;t be able to win anymore, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You should just admit defeat and leave to the demon world. Then we won&rsquo;t have to chase you, and we&rsquo;ll call it a draw!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gracia and Pico, who had been completely outclassed, were now in high spirits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Like Ultima, Pico and Gracia were fighting without using their skills. As a result, they had been humiliated even when outnumbering the opponent two to one. But now that the tables had turned, they felt happy, regardless of their position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up&hellip; I know that, too. But if I back out now, I won&rsquo;t be able to show my face to Rimuru-sama&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ultima was getting more and more grumpy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When this happened, she became more in the mood to go on a rampage, rather than win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She had been told by Rimuru that Dino and the other two were only under Michael&rsquo;s control. Therefore, she had been trying to neutralize them without really trying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But the question was, if she really tried, would she be able to defeat all the enemies in this place?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If it was a matter of life and death, the odds would be better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But even so, Ultima knew that she could not be sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Leon, Dino, Pico, and Gracia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of the four, Dino would be the most troublesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And perhaps, if Leon and Ultima were serious, it would not be surprising if either of them won.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, there was no chance of victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Veyron was right, and that is why Ultima did not throw a tantrum and remained silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She wondered what she should do, but the situation did not allow for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, Ultima made up her mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I believe in Rimuru-sama! He should be here soon, so we&rsquo;ll hold them off until then. Any objections, Veyron?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By your will!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, the plan was set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, you made the right choice. I commend you, Ultima.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The long-awaited reinforcements had arrived just in time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I took Diablo and Souei to the &ldquo;Holy Void&rdquo; Damargania.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We met up with Zonda via &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo; and rushed to Ultima&rsquo;s side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The scene we saw on the way was horrific.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The giants were gathering in a chaotic manner, and before I knew it, they were forming into a disciplined army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the head of the group was Dagruel, but he seemed to be a different person from the one I knew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Our eyes met for a moment, and he grinned at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To be honest, it felt dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I wondered what I should do, but there was only one answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now was not the time to be dealing with Dagruel. I contacted the relevant parties via &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; and left the scene as quickly as I could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so now, I had just met up with Ultima and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I brought Diablo and Souei with me. Add to that Ultima, Veyron, and Zonda, and we now had a force of six.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The opponents were Leon, Dino, Pico, and Gracia. If we could bring Leon back to his senses as planned, our victory would be secured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, Rimuru&rsquo;s here too?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Dino-kun. However, I&rsquo;ll deal with you later!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I replied, focusing my attention on Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Leon seemed to be aware of my intentions. The fact that he wasn&rsquo;t showing any signs of opposition was proof that Michael&rsquo;s control was not at the brainwashing level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although, I didn&rsquo;t think it was possible for anyone to force a person with a will strong enough to acquire an Ultimate Skill swear their allegiance wholeheartedly just by their own power. Even if there was such a thing, it would be fake, and the current situation suggested to me that it would only restrict the actions against Michael&rsquo;s will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, I decided to do something about the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I had declared, I would start with Leon, leaving Dino for later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leon, prepare yourself!

That meant that the only one who knew what was going on here was Michael, the one who was supposed to be attacking us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What the hell is going on&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;No way&hellip;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;No way,&rsquo; huh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, even Ciel-san didn&rsquo;t understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s not good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t know what was going on, and it seemed impossible to escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, the possibility of abandoning Diablo and Souei and running away was not an option from the beginning. Leon as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ultima, take those lying over there and get away from here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;B-But&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.

Please wait, Rimuru-sama. I can still fight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oh, so Diablo is okay after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, I had the feeling he wasn&rsquo;t dead, but I guess I should&rsquo;ve taken care of him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Seeing Diablo on his feet did not dampen Michael&rsquo;s spirits. He appeared to be absolutely confident that he could beat him as many times as he wanted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought to myself,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;This is a serious problem.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, Diablo. Retreat. Take Leon with you and get going.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an order. There&rsquo;s no way to win, so the best thing to do is escape.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I said that, I drew my sword and readied it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I knew that Michael wouldn&rsquo;t let me go since he was after me. So, the best thing to do was to use myself as bait and let the others escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo, of course, understood this. Even so, he seemed quite conflicted, but the word &ldquo;order&rdquo; appeared to have worked. He teamed up with Ultima and retrieved Souei and Leon. Then they retreated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, I thought you were going to interfere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have no interest in small fry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wow, it&rsquo;s a good thing Diablo wasn&rsquo;t listening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s a line that would put him straight on the must-kill list, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s vindictive, so he would definitely achieve it one day. That&rsquo;s what made him such a dangerous guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even so, on my own, it was one against four.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael alone would have been hopeless, but now I was good as dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, worst-case scenario, Veldora was still here, so I think I could be revived, but the thought of actually testing it still felt bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Would the resurrected me really be the same as the current me? That was the question that came to mind. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t like the idea of Veldora dying either&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I was thinking about this, Michael made a move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dino, leave this place to me, you guys should return as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oh, thankfully, he seems to want a one-on-one duel. Well, he might have found out that I was planning to free Dino and the others when I had the chance, but I knew the odds of that succeeding were slim, so it was definitely not a bad deal for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. If I have complete control over his mind, I won&rsquo;t be able to move as flexibly, and in his current state, he&rsquo;ll cut corners, won&rsquo;t he? I can&rsquo;t use a pawn like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oh, I see. He knew that Dino and Leon weren&rsquo;t really following him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So then, does that mean that Michael has completely beaten us to the punch this time?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;&hellip;&hellip;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, it&rsquo;s okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even Ciel-san makes mistakes, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;No. This is also part of the plan.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Once again, you should be generous about your defeats</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt120" id="ftnt_ref120">[120]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ciel-san&rsquo;s hating to lose was also a problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll stop talking so casually and do my best to not make things worse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that I knew I was going to lose, I felt much better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t want to be seen in a bad light, but now that Diablo and the others were gone, it was fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The only thing left to do was to give it my best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I prepared myself and began observing Michael.

She rented one of these rooms as a temporary command center and began to compile reports from her subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Once she grasped the situation, she let out a sigh as her head began to hurt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What the hell is going on&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She couldn&rsquo;t help muttering to herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Capitol was fully guarded to protect the safety of the dignitaries from various countries. Not only the Holy Knight Order, but also knights and temporarily recruited adventurers from various countries were on guard duty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If the Capitol were to fall, the chain of command would be disrupted, and so the refugees would be received elsewhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The main hall of the Holy Church in the Kingdom of Ingracia was also opened to receive refugees, and there were plenty of refugee centers throughout the capital.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was because the city had always been prepared for the Tenma Great War, which was said to occur every 500 years or so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was the case in not only the Kingdom of Ingracia, but in the Western Nations as well. People were provided with shelters in underground bunkers and caves in the nearby mountainsides. This was also the reason why they could sufficiently cope with the thorough evacuation, which was also on the agenda this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Regarding the current terrorist acts in the capital, they made sure to mitigate the human damage by evacuating the residents to such facilities. The purpose of this was to prevent major confusion from occurring and to prepare an environment in which they could concentrate on dealing with the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As of now, the results of the daily training had been demonstrated and the people were successfully led away. The evacuation was complete, and the people who escaped were now calm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, this was not a solution to the problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This time, it was not a natural disaster, but rather the people who caused the disturbance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">According to reports, explosions were happening all over the capital, and they were turning into fires. The cause of the fires was said to be majins of Special A rank and above.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Holy Knight Order had been mobilized for this event, as it was a gathering of dignitaries from various countries. Fortunately, the &ldquo;Holy Knights&rdquo; who were on guard duty were able to handle the situation, but the situation was not good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata was disgusted, but due to her position, she was not allowed to show even a hint of her true emotions on her face. It would only increase the anxiety of her subordinates and create unnecessary work for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moreover, Hinata deeply understood that she should not become emotional in front of the evacuees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would be a problem to further upset people who were already worried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So Hinata did not waver.<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All Hinata could do now was reduce the anxiety of the evacuees and prevent further chaos, even if only a little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fortunately, the facilities were comfortable and there was a stockpile of food.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At any rate, the right thing to do for now was to deal with the enemy without worrying the evacuees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave this to you. Have at least one Holy Knight stay at each shelter. Have the Templar Knights help as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The enemy wasn&rsquo;t just on the outside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The evacuees could also turn into a mob at any moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Things were still calm now, but there was no telling what would happen if it took too long to eliminate the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Those confused by fear, and those who screamed and rioted from anxiety&mdash;It was expected that the number of such people would increase as time went on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It all depended on the future situation, but in the worst case, it might be necessary to devote troops to suppress the riots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that in mind, Hinata swallowed a melancholy sigh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A short time had passed since the explosion had occurred.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, at last, the full extent of the enemy could be seen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A riot of the death penalty prisoners?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Moreover, the enemy has freed Prince Elric, who was under house arrest in the north tower of the castle and has made him their flagbearer!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Prince Elric&mdash;I see, that man hasn&rsquo;t shown any remorse at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elric was in the process of being re-educated due to his blunder at the council. He was on the verge of being deprived of his right to the throne, but Rimuru and King Aegil of Ingracia, who didn&rsquo;t want to make things worse, agreed that he would be reduced to the first degree of guilt as he was only being used at the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Still, it was a disgrace to the royal family, and for the past year he had been under house arrest in the north tower of the castle&hellip;but it seems that he had fallen into the hands of the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To make matters worse, he seemed to be voluntarily cooperating with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Not only that, but Elric and the others were accusing Hinata by name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">&ldquo;My dear people! I have been deceived by a witch! She has framed me and ruined my standing in the council. And now she wants to murder my father and bring chaos and misery to this land. Do not be fooled! She is trying to take away your freedom on the pretext of evacuating you! I trust that my dear and wise people will understand whose words are correct!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Said Prince Elric, who was apparently making a speech in the city&rsquo;s main square.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I heard it with my own ears.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can you corroborate?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get into the royal castle at the moment. I am checking it via Luminism&rsquo;s followers, but they seem to be quite confused&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s a good chance that King Aegil has been killed. What a terrible thing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a headache of a problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although she had expected a mob to be incited, she hadn&rsquo;t expected someone to make the worst choice at the worst time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To make matters worse, it was the royal family of the Kingdom of Ingracia who were the cause of Hinata&rsquo;s troubles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Prince Elric had caused problems, but the details of those problems had not been made public. That was an issue, and it only complicated the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was using his position as a member of the royal family to the fullest to mobilize the power of the state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even Hinata had not expected to see such a disruption in cooperation with the parties during an emergency situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, what should we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A white-haired beauty garbed in a military uniform appeared in front of Hinata as she pondered this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Leaning back on the sofa as gracefully, as if she were the owner of the room, the beautiful woman, Testarossa, opened her mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten proof. Moss has confirmed with his own eyes that Aegil was murdered.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;In other words, the upper management of this country is unreliable. All hell is breaking loose, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa nodded with a laugh, saying that the castle was in a state of chaos.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Going back and forth, the chain of command is in chaos.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; Hinata nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, Gadra has been ordered to protect the council chamber, so the safety of the dignitaries is guaranteed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa assured her that he could at least buy them some time. This was a pretty high evaluation, and Gadra was surprisingly well acknowledged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that does offer a bit of relief.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa and Hinata nodded at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, now things had become tricky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Not only was there an unknown enemy, but there was also someone who wanted to harm Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They seemed to be accusing Hinata by name for being a witch who misled people, but this was difficult to deny.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would not have been a problem if the enemy was just an ordinary person. If they were a nobleman, Luminism&rsquo;s public power could have crushed him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But this was the royal family of this country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The biggest problem of all was that Prince Elric was very popular among the people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Prince Elric was a handsome man with delicate manners, and he was popular among women. Regardless of his abilities, he was popular with the people because of his good-natured exterior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His blunder in the council was not known to the people and was irrelevant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata, though well known, was shunned for her cold-heartedness. In terms of popularity, she was far behind Prince Elric.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, Hinata herself was not aware of the fact that she had a huge following among some people with certain tastes. The group was quite gentlemanly, as they had the common sense to know that it would end once they were known.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All that aside, the problem now as about Prince Elric.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The subordinates were looking at Hinata anxiously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was only natural.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because the prince of this country was loudly denouncing Hinata to fuel the people&rsquo;s anxieties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was calling her a king-slayer, a witch enchanted by the demon lord, and someone who would lead the people to ruin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">But even so, I can&rsquo;t believe&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t expect him to be such a fool&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Inwardly, Hinata cursed herself for being so careless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She hadn&rsquo;t seen Prince Elric for the fool he was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata had never expected that he would go to such horrible lengths to kill his father and usurp the throne.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just then, there was a knock at the door and a knight entered the room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Arnaud Bauman, one of the captains of the Holy Knight Order, Hinata&rsquo;s trusted subordinate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hinata-sama, we have also confirmed the presence of Reiner, the former Knight Commander of the Kingdom of Ingracia. In addition, we have confirmed the presence of dozens of knights who were supposed to have been captured as his accomplices.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arnaud reported as soon as he entered the room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then it was Reiner who murdered the king, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been framed as the culprit, but I doubt he&rsquo;ll have the chance to explain himself in court.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata let out a big sigh in thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Reiner, that fucking bastard. How dare he hold a grudge against Hinata-sama just because he was beat up at the council meeting!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fritz, one of the captains waiting in the room, complained indignantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">According to Arnaud&rsquo;s explanation, Reiner, who had been intimidated by Hinata at the council meeting and had made the mistake of being incarcerated, was eager to clear his name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For this reason, he was planning to defeat Hinata in public to clear his name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a ridiculous story; a crime being committed out of personal resentment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, the root of the problem was deep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner took forceful measures to make up for his mistake. This was the common understanding of everyone, but there was no way to prove it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The whole thing was a setup, and the evidence seemed to have been destroyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was a way to get other countries&rsquo; representatives to testify, but that was only possible during peacetimes. In such a case of emergency, they could not endanger the senators, and the people would not believe anything Hinata and the others had to say now anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, Prince Elric was very popular in this country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was as clear as day who the people would believe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hinata-sama has never had a good reputation&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fritz quipped, and Arnaud gave a small nod of agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Glaring at the two, Hinata changed the subject with a comment of her own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re on the back burner.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But even so, I didn&rsquo;t think he would kill his own father, the king. He seems to be trying to pin the blame on Hinata-sama, but that&rsquo;s just absurd.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata&rsquo;s mutter was echoed by Arnaud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The purpose of Prince Elric and Reiner was obvious. They wanted to take advantage of the chaos and pretend that all their own blunders and sins had never happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rather than taking revenge on Hinata, they may be using this as a check against other nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They may be thinking that by defeating Hinata, the strongest of the Western Nations, they would be able to shut down protests from other nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand. I don&rsquo;t think this Reiner guy was good enough to assassinate the king.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From Hinata&rsquo;s point of view, Reiner was not weak, but he was not strong either. He was the equivalent of an Over A rank adventurer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A country as large as Ingracia should have several other knights who could rival Reiner. Moreover, the magical inquisitors who were present at the council meeting at that time should have been able to overpower Reiner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How this tragedy had succeeded was more of a mystery to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The answer came from Cardinal Nicolaus, who visited Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Apparently, the magical inquisitors have all been killed. We had information that they were conducting a suspicious experiment in the underground of this place, but it seems that the experimental entities have gone out of control.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nicolaus, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have come with a message from Luminas-sama, but I decided to look into this while I was here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicolaus replied, competent as ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was like a loyal dog who would do anything to be praised by Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was merciless to everyone other than Hinata, but he was also very good at keeping up appearances. He maintained an expression of warmth and was well-liked by his followers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, for those who knew his true nature, he was not someone they wanted to have anything to do with. In fact, Arnaud and Fritz kept a low profile, avoiding eye contact with Nicolaus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ignoring these outsiders, Nicolaus began to brew a pot of tea. He was a very diligent man who also earned points in this way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He prepared a cup of tea for Testarossa as well, and she looked satisfied when she took a sip of it. This was indicative of a very high score and proved that Nicolaus was no ordinary person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata also sipped her tea and collected her thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What if, rather than taking advantage of the chaos, this whole mess is just what Elric and the others want?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh? But those are monsters running rampant in the city, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first thing that&rsquo;s strange. How could a monster break into the royal capital that&rsquo;s protected by the &lsquo;city barriers&rsquo;? To begin with, the strength of the monsters is also rubbish, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The monsters reported were not in one, but rather several at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were said to be rampaging all over the capital, but their purpose was unknown. They were said to be going around destroying anything and everything they could find.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moreover, it seems that they had &lsquo;Ultraspeed Regeneration,&rsquo; which allowed them to repair their wounds immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The fighting ability was more than that of a Holy Knight. Fortunately, they seemed to be of low intelligence, and the knights were currently preparing decoys to minimize the damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Judging that it would be dangerous to deal with them individually, the soldiers were ordered to stay behind for now. After considering how to deal with them, Hinata was scheduled to go into battle in the worst-case scenario, but now a problem had arisen that they had to worry about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa joined the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;On that note, it seems that some of my subordinates have been defeated. They were under strict orders to retreat before they died, so I didn&rsquo;t get much information&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t get much but would still disclose the information she had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa&rsquo;s subordinates were the devil chevaliers. All of them are Special A rank, with existence values of over 100,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was no surprise that the magical inquisitors were no match for such a group of devil chevaliers, who had chosen to retreat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Apparently, the experimental subjects were incarnated by angels.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The ones that failed to incarnate are the monsters that are running rampant right now. And the ones who still have their egos intact&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The enemy who had defeated the devil chevaliers&mdash;Testarossa was convinced that it was one of Michael&rsquo;s men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After hearing Testarossa&rsquo;s explanation, Hinata tapped her fingers on the desk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The two remaining Holy Knight captains in the room were Arnaud and Fritz.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Leonard, the second-in-command, was in charge on the scene with Bacchus and Ritase in tow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thanks to the training in the labyrinth, even the common Holy Knights who were not captains had grown into powerful warriors. In fact, the captains had become so strong that they were capable of defeating Clayman-like opponents on their own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, against an experiment of magical inquisitors fused with the power of angels, it would be dangerous to take them on head-on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And with Michael&rsquo;s shadow flickering in the background as Rimuru&rsquo;s adversary, she decided that they shouldn&rsquo;t get involved carelessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nicolaus, you have a message from Luminas, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. She says it&rsquo;s not an urgent matter, but she can&rsquo;t send reinforcements.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That means there are other enemies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Luminas would never abandon Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Therefore, the fact that she could not send reinforcements meant that there was a high possibility of other threats lurking about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If that was the case, they would have to protect the security of the Royal Capital with only the forces currently at hand&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is tough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was the conclusion that Hinata came to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No matter how much the Holy Knights&rsquo; abilities had improved, it was still a heavy burden to have them take on an enemy that was clearly superior to them. What&rsquo;s more, the monster has taken in the power of the angels and had become a light attribute. The Holy Purification Barrier, which was effective against normal monsters, would not be effective at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, what should we do? Our usual winning tactics won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. It would be one thing if it was just the monsters, but there are also Reiner and the others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That Reiner fellow, he is probably a success.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa said, but only Hinata and Nicolaus understood what she meant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, what do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arnaud asked fearfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell you to think for yourself a little, but we don&rsquo;t have much time. If Reiner was also on death row, it wouldn&rsquo;t be strange if he was used as an experiment, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, so it&rsquo;s possible that he&rsquo;s taken in the power of an angel&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arnaud and Fritz understood, and their faces paled at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a possibility. Consider it a certainty.&rdquo; Testarossa told them ruthlessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, that being the case, it was impossible for the Holy Knight Order to deal with this matter alone. Inevitably, it would be important to cooperate with Testarossa&rsquo;s forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what are you going to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa asked, and Hinata answered without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s what the enemy wants, but I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to go to them for an explanation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Prince Elric claimed that Hinata was a king-slayer. There was no reason for Hinata to do such a thing, and she had a perfect alibi of being at the World Conference, so it was impossible for her claim to be accepted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, that would only be true in normal peacetimes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The current situation in the royal capital was chaotic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The people of Ingracia, accustomed to a world of peace, were in the midst of a catastrophe that had come out of the blue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If Hinata were to be killed here, all the claims about the real culprit would be accepted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In that case, running away was one option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just escape to Lubelius instead of foolishly going out there? Fortunately, the Holy Church in the capital has a transport team, and there is also a transfer spell if you pass through the suburbs. As long as Hinata-sama is safe, there can be many possible explanations later on, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Cardinal Nicolaus remarked, and Hinata agreed that it made sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But she couldn&rsquo;t simply nod in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible. We may be able to escape on our own, but we won&rsquo;t be able to take out the conference attendees, right? Once they&rsquo;re taken hostage, we won&rsquo;t have many other options.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Everyone agreed with that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Exactly. Besides, let&rsquo;s not forget that the true enemy is not here. What would happen if the army of angels were to attack, and the nation&rsquo;s key figures were killed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Upon hearing this, Nicolaus frowned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, you are right. If that were to happen, the cooperation between the nations would be torn apart. At the very least, no country would trust the Kingdom of Ingracia.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, if that happened, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fight against the angels.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fritz muttered with a bitter expression on his face, as if he had been convinced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In conclusion, there was no choice but to do as Hinata said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Based on her beliefs, Hinata set out to do what she could for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She did not want to save everyone, but if there was someone in front of her who could still be saved, she would reach out to them, because that was how Hinata lived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata knew very well that this would in turn lead to trust in them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I guess that&rsquo;s settled. Now, let&rsquo;s decide the division of roles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata said as such and declared that she would be Reiner&rsquo;s opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will go with you. Now, as for the monsters&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Without waiting for Testarossa&rsquo;s words to finish, Arnaud and Fritz, who had become stiff and immobile, shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We do not need Testarossa-dono&rsquo;s help. Please leave it to us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a monster without an ego and no intelligence, we can fight them. The light attribute is a bit of a problem, but we&rsquo;ve been trained in the labyrinth, so we&rsquo;ll show you what we can do!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata looked at the two of them with a frown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Why are they so conscious of Testarossa-dono?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She was taken aback, thinking that they were trying to look good in front of a beautiful woman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But the truth was something different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">These two were truly scared of Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If they didn&rsquo;t perform well here, they would be branded as useless. If that happened, it would be unclear what would happen regarding their special labyrinth training in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides, Testarossa had many sympathizers, not just in the labyrinth. She also had followers among the members of the parliament, so there was a danger that they might lose their power to speak out in the future if they were not careful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was how much Testarossa&rsquo;s influence had increased, but Hinata did not know that this was the case, having lost interest in politics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For Testarossa, this was a very important time. Despite Rimuru&rsquo;s orders to make the World Conference a success, she had allowed the enemy to invade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On top of that, she was responsible for being unable to stop the destruction in the capital.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Giving priority to human life was no excuse for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Behind her smile, Testarossa was burning with rage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was why she approved of Arnaud and the others&rsquo; suggestions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, please do. I will lend you some of my subordinates and you can incorporate them into your unit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She told him as such and went on to help Arnaud and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was all in preparation for her own move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She left the command to Arnaud and the others and gave them the task of restoring security to the capital. On top of that, she intended to strike the mastermind herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus, the division of roles was decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s go now. We have to bring down the death penalty on those who have acted foolishly in this time of emergency.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata said coldly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She was going to get rid of Reiner here to clear her own name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And she would capture Elric and make him confess to his crimes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or rather&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, the evidence is irrelevant. Once all the criminals have been taken out, the right story will be in the hands of the victor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;is what Testarossa said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was a declaration that she would do exactly what the enemy was trying to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa was a demon who did not care about ethics, and she believed that as long as she was the winner, she could do whatever she wanted. It was a very Testarossa-like argument.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, well aware that it was a trap, Hinata and the others headed to the stage where the enemy was waiting for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Once they were outside of the Capitol, they found things in a terrible state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Part of the royal castle in the center of the city had partially collapsed, spoiling its beautiful appearance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The aristocratic district, where the Capitol and the branch of the Holy Church were located, was relatively better, but the downtown area facing the main street of the city was on fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped that we prioritized evacuation, but this is going to be hard to clean up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Full-scale battles are still to come, and there will be more damage. With the loss of the king and his successor, it will take time for Ingracia to recover.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicolaus calmly responded to Hinata&rsquo;s murmur.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a cold reaction, unbecoming of a priest. But that was Nicolaus&rsquo; normal behavior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For Nicolaus, Hinata was the only priority, and he did not care about anything else. It was because he wanted to be of service to Hinata that he rose to the position of Cardinal, the highest rank next to the Pope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It is because he was such a man that he was still accompanying Hinata without regard for danger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, there were five of them now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata, Testarossa, and Cardinal Nicolaus, who had followed Hinata out of concern for her. These three were joined by Moss and Cien who had been summoned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As they headed for their destination, they planned their strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Moss, you don&rsquo;t have to fight, just go into &lsquo;search mode&rsquo; and prepare for a surprise attack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moss was a yes man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He obeyed Testarossa without saying anything else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even so, he would sometimes say unnecessary things and get into trouble, but as he had been Testarossa&rsquo;s second-in-command for a long time, he knew how to take care of himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This, Moss&rsquo;s &lsquo;Search Mode,&rsquo; was a kind of &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; of sorts. He dispersed his own fragmented &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; into a hemisphere of one kilometer in diameter. This allowed him to react immediately to a surprise attack from 500 meters away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At first glance, this may not seem to be any different from &lsquo;Universal Perception,&rsquo; but that was not the case. That was because the speed of information transmission was much faster, and Moss&rsquo;s own analytical ability was also added to deal with enemy attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moreover, five hundred meters was a perfect distance for Testarossa, whose &lsquo;perceptual speed&rsquo; could be increased by a million times with her skill. Even if it was an attack at the speed of light, under the influence of Moss&rsquo;s &lsquo;Search Mode,&rsquo; there would be more than a second before the attack would hit the target and it would be possible to deal with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of course, it was not possible to move at the speed of light, and this was merely extending the time being perceived, but Testarossa would still be able to manage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moss&rsquo;s &lsquo;Search Mode&rsquo; seemed to be perfect, but it had only one drawback.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moss was in the most danger because he was the one who would take the first hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Even if I&rsquo;m damaged by that surprise attack, I doubt she&rsquo;ll care&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although obedient, Moss still complained inwardly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Taking a glance at Moss&rsquo;s ability, Hinata saw through its nature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are still wary of surprise attacks. So then, you&rsquo;re saying that the one making all the noise is a decoy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa smiled when she pointed this out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. In the first place, we could narrow down the enemy&rsquo;s objective when they targeted this conference.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To divide the West, or to aim directly at Rimuru. The biggest opportunity for them is Hero Masayuki who has become the Emperor of the Eastern Empire, correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa&rsquo;s grin deepened as Hinata replied without a second thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As expected of you, Hinata-dono. Rimuru-sama did approve of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The flattery is nice. I&rsquo;m sure it would be obvious to anyone who saw it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not really, but that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa chuckled as she thought of the faces of the people she had conversed with recently. She had been under a great deal of stress because many of them were not very perceptive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Those who did not listen to others were the worst. They would express their opinions only for their own benefit, and there were many times when they could not reach a consensus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Some of them would announce their agreements on their own after the meeting, and she had a good taste of the troublesome nature of political negotiations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were even fools that the contract-oriented demon could not understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa made sure that such people knew their place, but she had always wished that they would not create unnecessary trouble for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this respect, her conversation with Hinata was quick and pleasant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s objective must be.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose so. There was an incident elsewhere at the same time as this ruckus, and Rimuru was headed there. They must have prepared a pretty big bait, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It had been agreed in advance that if Leon showed up, Rimuru would go. Testarossa had been told this, but Hinata had guessed it without knowing about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa explained the situation to a certain extent since she had already guessed so much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Upon hearing this, Hinata also pointed out some problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a very pleasant conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">I had heard that she was sharp, but I&rsquo;d like to have her as my subordinate. Although, I&rsquo;m sure Rimuru-sama would not approve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With Rimuru, just the fact that he allowed himself to be called by his own name suggested that Hinata was a special person. Moreover, when he was with Hinata, he seemed to return to his true self and appeared to enjoy himself very much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just by knowing Rimuru like that, it was the reason Testarossa couldn&rsquo;t help but give Hinata a glance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">It truly is enviable. However, I suppose I am honestly pleased that the woman Rimuru-sama recognizes is not a fool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since ancient times, there had been numerous cases where a country had been turned upside down by a woman had has gained the favor of the king.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this respect, Hinata was not someone she had to worry about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the first place, Rimuru and Hinata were not lovers, so Testarossa may have been thinking too much, but surprisingly, there were many people who thought like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The only ones who didn&rsquo;t know were the two people themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At any rate, right now they needed to know about the enemy&rsquo;s objective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Restoring Demon Lord Leon to his senses and bringing him back to their side. That was their basic strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But of course, it was expected that the enemy would be aware of that goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Feldway was smart enough to know that Rimuru-sama was the one who brought Velgrynd-sama to her senses. If so&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From Testarossa&rsquo;s perspective, there was no doubt that Feldway was capable. Despite his many shortcomings, she was certain that he had a plan to deal with Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We should also assume that he has a winning strategy in mind when he used Demon Lord Leon as bait to lure Rimuru out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rsquo; Testarossa nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of course, there was no way Rimuru could not see that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">He must have been able to plan far ahead,</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt121" id="ftnt_ref121">[121]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;seeing through the depths so that even Feldway&rsquo;s plan would be swallowed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama was aware of this and went to rescue Demon Lord Leon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa assured her with absolute confidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Hinata tilted her head in concern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But perhaps the enemy only called him over because they believed they could win. They say that Michael has taken in the power of the True Dragons, but can Rimuru really win against such a monster?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata&rsquo;s concern was understandable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From Testarossa&rsquo;s perspective, it seemed impossible that Rimuru would be defeated. But that was not a question that could be answered at this stage when they had not even seen the real enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What if Feldway or Michael were waiting for Rimuru at the destination?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Well, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll take care of it, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Diablo and Souei were also there as escorts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She had no choice but to believe that Rimuru would be fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If the enemy&rsquo;s goal was Rimuru, there was nothing for Hinata and the others to worry about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They could trust him, but the problem would be if the enemy had another objective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Although targeting the senators seems like a good idea, it&rsquo;s unlikely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree. There is no great advantage to splitting up the Western Nations right now. If they were capable of defeating Rimuru, they wouldn&rsquo;t even bother with a united coalition of nations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The two agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After considering various other possibilities, they settled on the most likely conclusion: &ldquo;The enemy&rsquo;s target is Masayuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, where did the His Majesty the Emperor disappear to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At some point after the outbreak, Masayuki had disappeared from the Capitol.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were probably Imperial guards outside the Capitol, and the &ldquo;Scorch Dragon&rdquo; Velgrynd was at Masayuki&rsquo;s side. Rather, it seemed to her that Masayuki was the safest one here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why she had left him alone, but it was a different story if the enemy&rsquo;s target was Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Perhaps Velgrynd-sama realized what the enemy was after and evacuated the area.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, no matter what the enemy&rsquo;s intentions were, Masayuki&rsquo;s safety was the priority. Testarossa knew that Velgrynd would have thought the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I guess it&rsquo;s safe to assume.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was at least better than defending themselves, Hinata agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If that was the case, the next thing to think about was their victory conditions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If the enemy&rsquo;s target is Masayuki, we&rsquo;re being used as bait, right? Do you think Masayuki will come to our rescue when we are about to be killed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata had also known Masayuki before, so she knew that the boy was soft-hearted. However, since he had become an emperor, he should put his own life first, and she believed that he would be cool-headed about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa agreed with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the main question. It is an unlikely assumption, but even if we were about to die, I don&rsquo;t think Masayuki-dono would come to our rescue.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this case, the problem was not just Masayuki&rsquo;s. Since Velgrynd was attached to him, there was no doubt that Masayuki should be given priority.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata and Testarossa agreed on this view as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Therefore, the conclusion was also the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, even if the people we&rsquo;re dealing with now only see us as bait, we have no reason to go along with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Let&rsquo;s take out all of them and lure out those who are hiding.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the end, winning would solve all their problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With a shared awareness of the possibility of surprise attacks, Hinata and the others arrived at their destination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moss has disappeared, and only four people remained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nicolaus, you stay here. If we are victorious, secure Prince Elric immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata did not say it, but it also meant to run away if they were defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicolaus was not a weak man, but he was not strong enough to stand on this battlefield. That&rsquo;s why she gave the order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood. I wish you luck!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicolaus did not want to be a liability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was prepared to use his own life as a shield in the event of Hinata&rsquo;s danger, but at that moment he obeyed quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus, Hinata and the others entered the square with only the three of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When the group arrived at the square in the capital, they were met by a group of fully armed knights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Not including Elric and Reiner, there were nearly twenty of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve finally arrived, I was tired of waiting!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Reiner, whom Hinata knew well, who smirked and shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From a cursory observation, she could see that he had been strengthened tremendously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From the presence that she could feel, Hinata guessed that the amount of energy was greater than her own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">I was right to leave Nicolaus out of this. In a real fight, I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t have time to worry about him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If that happened, Nicolaus would have been involved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a mere human being, Nicolaus would have had no way to survive, so Hinata was a little relieved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In any case, she ignored Reiner&rsquo;s words and analyzed the enemy&rsquo;s strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Elric has no dominating energy, so it seems that he&rsquo;s still a normal human. But the others&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elric seemed to have been just playing the role of a portable shrine and he looked the same as before. He was a little shabby, but that was probably because he had been under house arrest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The others, however, were a problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">There&rsquo;s an unusual air about them. I see, they&rsquo;re even more powerful than the Holy Knight captains. Perhaps they&rsquo;re even as powerful as me&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Although it was impossible to say for certain just by looking at them, Hinata possessed the unique skill, &lsquo;Mathematician.&rsquo; She analyzed the enemy and found them to be at least Calamity-class. Some of them, such as Louis and Roy, appeared to be comparable to Disaster-class, and with nearly twenty of them, it was going to be a tough fight even for the &ldquo;Saint</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt122" id="ftnt_ref122">[122]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo; Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was not the biggest problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Reiner is insane. He probably even outperforms me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although not as powerful as Testarossa standing next to her, she could sense a great deal of power from him. This was dangerous, Hinata thought, and she became even more vigilant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If she could leave it to Testarossa, that would be the safest choice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was not possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because there was another man in this place who was just as dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gyahyahyahya! Reiner, we&rsquo;re in luck! With two such beauties here, we won&rsquo;t have to fight with each other!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No doubt. Brother Vega, I&rsquo;ll take Hinata as promised, is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. Eating such a weak woman won&rsquo;t make me any stronger. Well, you can still enjoy her in other ways, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m on a mission right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was Vega, the man laughing with a vulgar voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was sitting on the edge of the fountain with his legs spread wide, radiating a terrifying aura without even trying to hide it. Vega&rsquo;s attribute was evil itself, even though he had taken in the light-attribute spiritual life form of an angel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">It looks like I can&rsquo;t do anything about him. I might be able to stick it out, depending on my strength, but my chances of winning are probably close to zero.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata saw through this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, Vega&rsquo;s existence value was over 10 million, more than ten times greater than Hinata&rsquo;s. Even though Hinata also had a hidden trick up her sleeve, the probability of her winning seemed unlikely even if she were to use it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In that case, there could be no other opponent for Vega than Testarossa. Inevitably, Hinata&rsquo;s opponent would be Reiner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are vulgar. I hate fools who don&rsquo;t know their place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa smiled bewitchingly and looked down on Vega as she said this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata found her confidence to be reassuring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Cocky bitch</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt123" id="ftnt_ref123">[123]</a></sup><span class="c1">. Fine then, I, the great leader of the Seven Angels of Death, will show you what I&rsquo;m made of!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Very easily, Vega was provoked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a result, the battle between Testarossa and Vega was decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no way to escape this momentum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata asked with a relaxed manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, who&rsquo;s going to be my opponent? I couldn&rsquo;t move under all of those glares, perhaps you are all planning to challenge me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that, she was trying to incite them into a one-on-one battle with Reiner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If they all came at her, Hinata would have little chance to win. Even if she and Cien fought together, they would only be able to kill about ten people at most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, if she could get rid of Reiner first, she would be able to discourage the remaining enemies. If that happened, they would not be able to show their full strength, and her chances of winning would be greatly increased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, Hinata thought that Reiner would have no choice but to accept the challenge. The reason was that there were magical devices in various parts of the capital that were connected to the underground shelters so that people could see what was going on above ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The stone statue in the fountain of the main square was one of them, and the conversation between Hinata and Reiner was known to the people of the capital.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elric also knew this, which is why he was making a big speech here, and of course Reiner knew it too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he runs away from the battle here, he will never be able to clear our name&mdash; Reiner would think so, Hinata thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her expectation was correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukuku, I&rsquo;ve been taken as a fool. I was a bit out of sorts at that time. I will prove it by beating you here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus, Reiner and Hinata were also thrown into battle with each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata drew her sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a gem given to her by Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was not a unique-grade rapier. Since then, improvements had been made, and Kurobee&rsquo;s skills had improved, so the quality had risen to the legendary grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The weapon&rsquo;s name was &lsquo;Phantom Pain.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even though it was of the same legendary-grade level, its quality was lower than that of the Moonlight Sabre&rsquo;s. However, this Phantom Pain could perfectly reproduce the &ldquo;Dead End Rainbow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sword she used when fighting Rimuru was capable of completely destroying the spiritual body on the seventh attack. This sword, however, was capable of destroying even the astral body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Needless to say, it was more powerful and stronger than the Moonlight Sabre in terms of usability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You idiot, that&rsquo;s my line!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, the battle began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata, as usual, analyzed the enemy&rsquo;s strength and searched for their weaknesses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At first glance, Reiner appeared to be a human, but his true nature seemed to have been transformed into a different creature. As evidence of this, his body movements were strange. Apart from walking, Reiner smoothly moves sideways. He even kicked the ground and jumped into the air in the same position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The secret seemed to be hidden in the soles of his shoes, but what was more striking were his shoulders. It was obvious that he was hiding something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Die!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner swung his sword wide and swung at Hinata. Instead of deflecting it, Hinata quickly twisted her body to avoid it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was the correct response because she had sensed a premonition of danger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">That sword feels more powerful than just legendary-grade. I see, it&rsquo;s mythical-grade&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t know how or where he got it, but it was the moment when she got a glimpse of Reiner&rsquo;s power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At this point, the difference in weapon performance was also disadvantageous. There was a risk that Hinata&rsquo;s Phantom Pain would be shattered if they were to slash each other properly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In reality, there was a huge gap between the two players&rsquo; existence values.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although Hinata was a Saint, she carried the Hero&rsquo;s Egg, but it never hatched and was left to Chloe. Her power as Saint remained unchanged, but it was a little over a million in terms of existence value.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was strong enough for a human. In fact, it was equal to King Gazel, but it was not as strong as Reiner, who was equivalent to 2 million.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, this was only in terms of physical strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata had the memory and experience of traveling with Chloe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was still alive and well in Hinata&rsquo;s pure skill level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was a huge difference from when she had faced Reiner before, and when looking at things in overall strength, even if you put the difference in weapon performance into perspective, Hinata was much stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was as if Hinata&rsquo;s victory was guaranteed as soon as she could get into a one-on-one fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was only if Reiner had been a knight of fair character.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata had misjudged him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata had thought that Reiner was quite a lowly character, but Reiner was a coward beyond her imagination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata was also quite cautious and never let her guard down, but there were unimaginably stupid people in this world who were even lower than the lowest of the low.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner was exactly such a person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t know and didn&rsquo;t care if this was due to his innate nature or if he had been distorted by the experimentation. What was important here was that Reiner did not intend to simply fight her from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata continued to dodge Reiner&rsquo;s sword, going back and forth several times. Then, at the right moment, she flicked Reiner&rsquo;s sword away from his side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This made her sure of victory and she gave Reiner a chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, you&rsquo;re not as good as you say you are. If you surrender&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She would arrest Reiner as a traitor and put him on trial&mdash;showing him unnecessary mercy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This proved to be fatal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner had fallen into a position where his men were standing behind Hinata. They all attacked her from behind, as if they had planned to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of course, Hinata had prepared for the surprise attack with &lsquo;Magic Perception,&rsquo; and was also connected to the &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; with Moss, so she was warned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, it was Reiner that she needed to be wary of, and she could not afford to devote her attention to a bunch of random people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was why she knew that she had no chance to win if they were outnumbered&mdash;she had to accept a certain amount of attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was an instantaneous event.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hinata-dono!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Faster than Cien&rsquo;s shout, numerous light bullets exploded into Hinata. And then, as Reiner laughed loudly, he struck again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no sword in his hand, but his body was also covered by a mythical-grade full-body armor. His shoulders were wide open, and two pairs of thin, hard hands covered with mythical-grade armor sprouted out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They turned into four spears and pierced Hinata&rsquo;s limbs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Losing her support, Hinata fell to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sword fell from her hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She lost her grip and could barely stand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha!! You&rsquo;ve been acting all high and mighty, but you&rsquo;re no better than your mouth! You&rsquo;re too cocky, you&rsquo;re better off lying on the ground like that!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner laughed in an annoying high-pitched voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bastard! Wasn&rsquo;t this supposed to be a fair fight?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner snickered at Cien&rsquo;s sullen shout.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Criminals don&rsquo;t have any human rights. But hey, we&rsquo;re merciful. If you cry and beg for forgiveness, we&rsquo;ll at least consider postponing the time of your execution for a little while.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that said, Reiner gave her a smirk. Without waiting for Hinata&rsquo;s reply, he continued with his selfish argument.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, you&rsquo;ll have to show some gratitude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The smile on Reiner&rsquo;s face was unpleasant, as if he was thinking vulgar thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner&rsquo;s subordinates did the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha! The strongest of the West is looking good!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess the undefeated witch will have to be put down now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, we&rsquo;re just getting too strong. It only looked like a good match because Reiner-sama was playing with her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so on, they continued their self-serving comments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was unclear if they had always been like that or not. However, it was a fact that they were inexplicably foolish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata&rsquo;s appearance had become too cruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The torn back of her &ldquo;Holy Spirit Armor&rdquo; revealed her bare, burned skin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The tendons of her limbs had been severed so that she could not even move them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In spite of such misery, her bare face, wet with sweat, was beautiful. Her eyes never lost their brightness, and Hinata&rsquo;s dignified expression showed that she had not given up yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on then, cry and beg for forgiveness. Or shall I kill you right now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner shouted, his eyes bloodshot with madness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sight of Hinata crawling on the ground had given him a rush of lecherous pleasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By now, Reiner&rsquo;s rational mind had practically jumped away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata was normally beyond his reach, a flower of the highest order, and to be able to violate such a high being surpassed all the pleasures Reiner had ever felt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No matter how much of a fool Reiner was, he was aware of his inferiority compared to Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, he had realized it the moment he faced her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">No matter how much he outclassed her in strength, he could not overturn the &ldquo;difference in quality</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt124" id="ftnt_ref124">[124]</a></sup><span class="c1">.&rdquo; Even in terms of sword skills alone, Hinata&rsquo;s ability was light years ahead of Reiner&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner had practically been mad with jealousy when he was confronted with this fact. That was why he had no hesitation in executing the trap that he had prepared for just in case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was not as he had originally planned, but the result was all right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">I&rsquo;m also lucky that her face wasn&rsquo;t damaged. I will enjoy watching her beautiful face contort and cry out in pain!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner felt his blood boil and his strength pervade his body. Just imagining Hinata in such a state made him feel a black joy well up from the pit of his stomach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that this was the case, Reiner believed that his victory was unassailable. That was why he would beat Hinata into submission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And after that, there would be another kind of fun waiting for him&hellip;he thought it would be a shame to kill her now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey! If you don&rsquo;t hurry up, I&rsquo;ll really kill you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner declared in a chilling voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a serious threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Part of him wanted to feel the pleasure of tormenting Hinata, but Hinata&rsquo;s strength was real.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If her heart had not been broken at this point, he should have at least cut off her hands and feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner was a coward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why he was cautious and thought about what he was doing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even if Hinata were to call the others now, it would take them a long time to arrive. In the first place, it was unlikely that they could gather enough forces to fight against them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides, if he sensed any sort of a sign, he could give the order to attack as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had the absolute advantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was nothing to lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata did not reply, but kept staring at Reiner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her eyes told him that she hadn&rsquo;t lost yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Tsk, you really are a cocky bitch. In that case, I&rsquo;ll drop a leg off you!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner raised his sword in annoyance and swung it down towards Hinata&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata was in mortal danger, but Testarossa couldn&rsquo;t afford to help her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She has her hands full with Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides, she could tell from the look in her eyes that Hinata had not given up. In that case, she had to believe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">She was one of the few people who managed to beat Rimuru-sama to a draw. I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll just leave so quickly in such a place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s what happened, then that&rsquo;s what would happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although it was very likely that Rimuru would be furious, Testarossa had not been ordered to protect Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were times for her to act in discernment, but for Hinata it felt like it was not her business. In fact, it seemed to be more likely to hurt Hinata&rsquo;s pride and displease Rimuru if she did something without permission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa decided that it would not be too late to come to the aid of Hinata after her defeat had been confirmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, without hesitation, she concentrated on Vega for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega was a nuisance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega&rsquo;s magicule count was several times larger than Testarossa&rsquo;s, but she thought it would be easy to kill him. However, it seems that she was wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">This guy, he&rsquo;s got roots all the way underground. If so, can he absorb the corpses to make his damage go away?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was exactly as Testarossa was thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega had spread his power all over the capital of Ingracia, capturing and absorbing the corpses of the monsters that were still being defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It did not increase his strength, but it was the perfect way to replenish his missing parts and replenish his energy. This made Vega practically immortal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">What an annoyingly troublesome opponent&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was Testarossa&rsquo;s true opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It might be possible to destroy him by burning down a large area with nuclear magic. But in order to do so, she needed to understand Vega in his entirety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That alone would have been a hassle, but even before that, she couldn&rsquo;t afford to do so. As long as they were fighting here in the royal capital of Ingracia, any action that would lead to the destruction of the city was basically forbidden.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were allowed to escape, but they were not allowed to do anything to win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In that case, it would be almost impossible to kill Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moreover, it was not a good idea to hunt Vega down. If she did so, there was a high possibility that he would use the people of the Royal Capital who had fled underground as bait and try to regenerate himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For now, he still had Reiner&rsquo;s subordinates who had turned into monsters, and absorbing them would be enough. However, if she cornered him further, Vega would probably to resort to any means necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From Testarossa&rsquo;s perspective, she was being forced to fight a battle where she could not see a way to win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What made this situation even more frustrating for her was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, hey, what&rsquo;s the matter?! For someone with all that bravado earlier, you&rsquo;re not doing much at all!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was the attitude of Vega, who was getting carried away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">It&rsquo;s not easy to make me want to kill someone from the bottom of my heart. You should be proud of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa inwardly snapped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, it was true that she could not afford to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She flicked her flaming whip and toyed with Vega, but her mind was able to see two or three moves ahead. As long as she was unable to get into a checkmate situation, she had no choice but to maintain the stalemate. In order to break that stalemate, some external factor would be necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was a hidden force on the enemy side. There was no doubt about that, so Testarossa and her team were at a disadvantage from a broader perspective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If there was one factor that tipped the scales in Testarossa&rsquo;s favor, it was the presence of Velgrynd. However, she was unlikely to leave Masayuki&rsquo;s escort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">It&rsquo;s likely that Feldway&rsquo;s target is also Masayuki-dono. Velgrynd-sama is not so naive as to dare to play into the hands of the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Naturally, Velgrynd must be aware of Feldway&rsquo;s intentions. In that case, Testarossa believed that Velgrynd would not come to their aid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And at the same time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa understood that they were being treated as bait to lure Masayuki out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This stalemate was a good situation for Feldway and his group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">It&rsquo;s really frustrating. I know what I&rsquo;m doing, but I&rsquo;m just going to have to live with it. Apparently, Carrera and Ultima have their hands full, and there is no one else in their ranks who can move. If only Zegion and the others could come&mdash;no, Rimuru-sama wouldn&rsquo;t approve of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She knew that her colleagues were also struggling, as evidenced by the emergency call through the Control Room. The Control Room had now declared a state of emergency and had shifted into combat mode.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were preparing for an enemy invasion, and there was no way that Zegion, the key defender, could leave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Zegion was the only one who could be relied upon to move freely. The others were not weak, but they were not strong enough to overcome any situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, there was also the superpower force of Veldora&mdash;but he couldn&rsquo;t make the foolish move of leaving the labyrinth when Michael was after him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, no reinforcements were coming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa had no choice but to conclude that she would have to fend for herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But then, something unexpected happened&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner swung his sword down on Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At that moment&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">Kwiing!</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A clear tone rang out as it was caught by someone&rsquo;s sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, it was not a sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What the beautiful woman was holding in her hand was a feather fan that did not look like a weapon at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The name of the beautiful woman, whose shining blue hair was fluttering in the air&mdash;it was the &ldquo;Scorch Dragon&rdquo; Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hinata, was it? Didn&rsquo;t my foolish brother say that he proved that the skills you&rsquo;ve developed and perfected could reach us True Dragons?

That said, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting you to come.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ufufu, you&rsquo;re right. I didn&rsquo;t plan on intervening, but Masayuki did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd turned to Masayuki, her eyes full of compassion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What she saw before her was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you okay, Hinata-san?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was Masayuki squeezing Hinata&rsquo;s breasts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The man in question, Masayuki, appeared to be in a dignified state, but on the inside, he was in a state of panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Wh-What the hell is going on?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Due to the sudden event, Masayuki instantly lost all sense of reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Or rather, this feeling on my right hand is&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was a soft and fluffy feeling coming from the palm of his right hand. This was the moment when Masayuki&rsquo;s brain finally began processing what it was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was, in other words, the result of Masayuki&rsquo;s distraction from Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Masayuki tried to help Hinata up, he stumbled over a pebble that had fallen at his feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a result, Masayuki fell and carefully pushed Hinata down as well. Then his right hand touched Hinata&rsquo;s chest regardless of Masayuki&rsquo;s intention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">It was a lucky deviance</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt125" id="ftnt_ref125">[125]</a></sup><span class="c1">, to say the least.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And what&rsquo;s more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thanks to the close proximity of their lips, Hinata&rsquo;s true face could also be seen clearly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her widened eyes sparkled like blackish purple amethysts. Her nose was straight, and her lips were full and fresh. Her fine skin was translucent without any makeup.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">She&rsquo;s a really beautiful woman. It&rsquo;s no wonder Rimuru-san can&rsquo;t resist her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was Masayuki&rsquo;s way of escaping from reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was understandable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata&rsquo;s breath tickled his nostrils, and the sweet smell of her breath made his brain swoon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Velgrynd&rsquo;s repeated hugs and experiences, he might have fainted from sheer joy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It seemed like a long time, but it all lasted less than a second.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki&rsquo;s brain rebooted and he realized that he could not keep staring at her forever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata&rsquo;s eyes widened in surprise, and Masayuki thought, &ldquo;Of course she did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was only natural that people would think, &ldquo;What is this guy doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was afraid that Hinata would come to her senses. Masayuki feared that something terrible was waiting for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-It&rsquo;s not what it looks like!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not true, Masayuki was screaming in his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki turned more and more pale as he tried to stand up and make an excuse&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Huh? Just now, something just&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki felt a jolt on his back and realized that something had just passed over him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then he felt a creeping sense of dread.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Masayuki?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What followed next was Velgrynd&rsquo;s scream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was not a voice of anger towards Masayuki, but rather a voice of sincere concern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What had just happened?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, right at the very moment of Masayuki&rsquo;s fall, someone had attacked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was the only one who saw it coming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was an attack that even Testarossa could not detect. At any rate, she was in a hurry to check the link with Moss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But before she even had the chance to call out to Moss, Masayuki managed to avoid the attack by accidentally falling. If he had not stumbled, his life would have been cut short.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A lucky boy, indeed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The lucky guy showed a remarkable performance this time as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Whoa! Was I really being targeted?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki, who found out late, was paling away in a different way, but he was still lucky that it was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then, Hinata moved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would have been extremely dangerous and foolish to stay still in a place that was being targeted. Therefore, Hinata rolled over and took Masayuki in her arms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki was moved. The happy feeling of being embraced, the silky and comfortable feeling of Hinata&rsquo;s hair on his cheek. It tickled and smelled so good, he wanted to escape from reality. However, that was not allowed&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or rather, this was not the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsk, no way&hellip;I never thought you&rsquo;d be able to avoid my assassination attempt&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A man in a black costume with pure white wings on his back let out a cry of astonishment&mdash;It was Arios.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The unique skill &lsquo;Murderer,&rsquo; whose base was the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Punishment King Sandalphon,&rsquo; had the power of &lsquo;Presence Concealment.&rsquo; It was a Skill that made those under its influence unrecognizable until some action was taken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With this skill, he and Feldway had been hiding and watching the situation this whole time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then, just as Masayuki appeared on the scene, he launched a desperate assassination attempt which failed miserably.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios was ready to try again, but two men stood in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Masayuki&rsquo;s enemies are my enemies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s how it is. I won&rsquo;t let you lay a hand on His Majesty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And with that, Venom and Minits had entered the fray.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A little later, Bernie and Jiwu also showed up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was charged with protecting His Majesty&rsquo;s person, yet I overlooked the assassin. For this sin, I will&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Bernie and Jiwu had been hiding and guarding Masayuki, but they hadn&rsquo;t realized that Arios was lurking within the perimeter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was not either of their faults, but it was definitely a big blunder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Masayuki was in a panic to deny it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he didn&rsquo;t, the two of them might have taken the blame and committed suicide or something annoying like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At any rate, he decided to tell them to focus on the enemy for now, and let this matter go unanswered. As a result, the four of them took up arms against Arios to protect Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The battlefield had been rearranged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa and Moss were on high alert.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Cien was fighting alone against the knights, trying to keep them restrained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata was struggling to stand up, and Masayuki was in a quandary as he was lending a shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Venom and the Empire&rsquo;s top executives had come to protect Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicolaus, who had called for Velgrynd and Masayuki, or rather had joined them on the way, was furious at the sight of Hinata&rsquo;s miserable state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And Velgrynd was smiling bewitchingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the other side&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner, unable to finish off the cornered Hinata, looked disgruntled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega was smirking and enjoying the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios was unsuccessful in his attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway was displeased with the failure of his plan just after it seemed like it had succeeded completely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then there were Reiner&rsquo;s subordinates who were still alive and well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With Masayuki and Velgrynd now on the battlefield, the situation had become even more chaotic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span

class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Those who could see the images had their eyes glued to the screen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although Reiner&rsquo;s words were uncomfortable, there was no doubt that Prince Elric was on his side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, as the battle intensified, people were turned off by Reiner&rsquo;s cruelty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He fought in a vile manner, unbecoming of a knight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides, it was not the knights led by Reiner who were still desperately defending the capital, but the Holy Knight Order and Templar Knights under Hinata&rsquo;s leadership.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Regardless of who&rsquo;s words were true, it was Hinata&rsquo;s knights that they wanted to trust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were some who supported Elric, but the ratio of those who supported Elric became smaller and smaller.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And when Hinata was in trouble, everyone prayed for her safety in front of the screen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This wish was fulfilled by the appearance of a certain person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Small whispers began to escape from the mouths of those who saw the shining figure.</span></p><p

If there was anyone who would do such a thing, it would be none other a force that wished to bring chaos to human society.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even the ruler of the underworld, the &ldquo;Three Drunk Sages (Riega),&rdquo; had unofficially offered their cooperation to ensure the success of this world conference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Without the development of human society, there would be no future for the underworld. It was a very plausible argument, and the upper echelons of the kingdom had also chosen to work together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Therefore, the only people who would cause dissonance here were those who did not understand the situation. In other words, it was the opinion of those in power that Prince Elric himself was the ringleader.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The people were confused, but thanks to Masayuki-dono, they have regained their composure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all well and good, but it puts us in an awkward position.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed.

It was just a touch of my hand&mdash;He tried to make an excuse, but unconsciously turned to face Hinata at close range, and Masayuki tensed up at the sight of her beauty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were many beautiful women in Tempest, but they were of the nature of extraordinary beauty. The same was true of Velgrynd, who&rsquo;s beauty was similarly outside the realm of humanity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In contrast, Hinata&rsquo;s beauty was that of a familiar Japanese face. Although her beauty had been enhanced by becoming a &lsquo;Saint,&rsquo; she still possessed a unique charm that made one feel at ease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But one shouldn&rsquo;t be fooled by appearances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki had heard a lot about her from Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata was the only one who must never be offended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even Veldora agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a persistent woman. No matter what you do, she will surely be avenged&rsquo;&mdash;he had warned him with a straight face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would be unfortunate if he were to do something inappropriate with someone who had made a demon lord and a True Dragon fear her. Fully aware of this, Masayuki hurriedly jumped to his feet and apologized to Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, although she pretended to be calm at that time, Hinata was also very upset. She had never had her breasts squeezed by another person before and was wondering how she should react.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If it had been intentional, Hinata would have taken appropriate measures to deal with it, but in Masayuki&rsquo;s case, it was completely unavoidable. This made Hinata&rsquo;s judgment waver, and ultimately saved Masayuki&rsquo;s life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry. I-It was by no means on purpose&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was unable to come up with a good excuse, but Masayuki&rsquo;s words were interrupted by Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just kidding. I know it was a force majeure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Despite the smile on her face, Masayuki couldn&rsquo;t stop the cold sweat running down his spine. In fact, he had no idea what was going on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His understanding couldn&rsquo;t catch up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He wanted to tell her frankly, but he felt like he would be doomed if he did, so he could only keep silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be seriously offended by a mere breast rub, can you? Hey, Masayuki, I&rsquo;ll let you squeeze mine as much as you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd dropped a bomb with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;No thank you&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t be said. Masayuki was still a young man after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, he sincerely hoped that such a meeting would be held in a quiet and unobtrusive place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata looked at them with a furtive glance, but when she tried to get up, she groaned in pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hi-Hinata-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While screaming, Cardinal Nicolaus rushed over and held Hinata up. Her arms and legs were still pierced, and she could not even stand up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will treat you immediately!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicolaus, in a panic, performed an impressive high-ranking holy magic (high heal) with great skill. Hinata immediately recovered and returned to the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus, the rearranged battle resumed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hi-Hinata-sama&hellip;is this okay? Why don&rsquo;t you leave this to Masayuki-dono?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicolaus asked, but Hinata turned a deaf ear to his suggestion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki, who was horrified by Nicolaus&rsquo; words, was greatly relieved to learn that Hinata had no intention of doing so. There was nothing else to do but to ask Hinata to do her best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Knowing this, Hinata gave a small smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a truly cruel smile, a true expression of Hinata&rsquo;s beauty, a beautiful woman wearing men&rsquo;s clothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To tell the truth, Hinata had lost her temper with Reiner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And more than that, she could not forgive herself for her mistake of being careless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no problem. I&rsquo;m done waiting around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a declaration of victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no room for pity for the person who had tortured her so much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata had completely read the path to victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata looked at Reiner with a benevolent smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her eyes, however, remained cold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, now then. I&rsquo;ll take you seriously, so be prepared.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;D-Damn you! You&rsquo;re the one who killed the king, you big sinner&hellip;and now, I&rsquo;m done playing with you! I&rsquo;ll kill you. You will never be able to win against me no matter what, you coward!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Funny you should say that. You&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s a coward.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was nothing more annoying than having the truth pointed out to you, Reiner gritted his teeth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsk, I guess you misunderstood. I took it easy on you because you&rsquo;re a woman, you know? I was trying to be gentle with you so I wouldn&rsquo;t accidentally kill you. Even so, I can&rsquo;t forgive your attitude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner&rsquo;s eyes were bloodshot with excitement, and his mind was on the verge of going insane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In anticipation of this, Hinata continued to instigate him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, is that so? Well then, you&rsquo;d better get yourself together and prove it to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata was no longer careless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She knew that Reiner was not a chivalrous man, and she had no intention of showing mercy to a such a vulgar being.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perhaps Reiner understood this, and he howled with his face turning red.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forgive you even if you cry. Fine then, I&rsquo;ll grant you your wish! Over and over again, I&rsquo;ll slash and slash and slash!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner&rsquo;s sole purpose was to show off his strength to his subordinates and the public by overwhelmingly overpowering Hinata. Normal judgment was no longer something he could hope for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perhaps sensing this, Hinata looked at Reiner coldly. There was not a trace of kindness in her eyes, and they were filled with contempt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner rushed towards Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unperturbed, Hinata readied her Phantom Pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then, their swords clashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hyaaaaaahaahaahaaa!! Die, die, die, dieeeeeee!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner shouted with an expression full of madness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sword he swung down with all his might had the power to kill, but it was no match for Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It could shatter even the Phantom Pain if taken seriously, but there was no need to meet it head on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no need to hesitate anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even though Reiner&rsquo;s physical ability was better than Hinata&rsquo;s, it did not matter to her. She dodged Reiner&rsquo;s sword lightly and aimed at the gap in his armor to stab him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gyaaaaah?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner screamed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The intense pain rushed through his body, and he regained his composure for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">What, what is this pain?! Didn&rsquo;t I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I gain power and become immune to such half-hearted attacks?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He became Vega&rsquo;s servant and had gained the power of a &lsquo;staff officer&rsquo; grade phantom. In addition, now that he had been given mythical-grade armor, there was no way he could be defeated by Hinata. Moreover, the fact that he could feel pain was unusual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He could not hide his confusion at the fact that his &lsquo;pain blocker&rsquo; was ineffective. The damage itself was not serious, but the pain did not seem to subside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner gritted his teeth. Earlier, he had thought that he was just in bad shape, but now he was beginning to show serious impatience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ufufufufu. Did I hurt you? Cry harder and entertain me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata had an ecstatic expression on her face and lasciviously moistened her lips with her tongue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This gesture suited Hinata very well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was reminiscent of a superior predating on the inferior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While Nicolaus was staring at Hinata with a passionate gaze, Masayuki was horrified. It was a gesture that might create a rabid fan base among some of the sexually inclined, but for Masayuki, it was a pity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">This person is scary!! I&rsquo;ll make sure to never offend Hinata-san&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was truly convinced that Rimuru was right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata pursued Reiner without caring about the reactions of the people around her,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fearing the incomprehensible pain of the stab, Reiner desperately tried to defend himself. However, the attack was not so sweet that it could be escaped from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now die! &lsquo;Dead End Rainbow!!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With a fluid movement, Hinata accurately pierced Reiner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Each blow was painful and tormented Reiner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Th-This much! If I can endure this pain&mdash;Gugyaaaaaoooooo?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because his mind had been destroyed, there was no way he could endure it. To begin with, Reiner&rsquo;s physical body had been strengthened tremendously, but his mental body was still immature. Even if he had absorbed the phantom, which was a spiritual life form, his mental defense had not been strengthened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-Help me, Vega-san! Th-The pain won&rsquo;t go away!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner tried to heal the damage he had suffered, but he could not heal his mind. It was not surprising that Reiner, who was in a state of panic due to the intense fear and suffering, lost his normal judgement and was unable to do anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moreover, because his spiritual body had grown too large, the time he spent in pain was much longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was so bad that he thought he would rather be dead&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the beginning of the battle, Venom had been the main opponent of Arios.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The remaining three players served as supporters, keeping Arios in check.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki was standing with his arms crossed, watching Venom&rsquo;s battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To be honest, it would be more accurate to say that he was just standing there, rather than watching the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The occasional glow was his proof that the battle was still going on. It was an impossible task for Masayuki to understand the battle with his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The speed was too fast to follow with his eyes, and it was impossible to understand what was going on. He was just pretending to be able to see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">&mdash;I mean, there&rsquo;s nothing I can do about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Not wanting to get in the way, he left the fighting to the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki now understood exactly what he was capable of. It was on the level of enlightenment, so his sense of fear was diminishing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even so, fear was still fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To distract himself from his fear, Masayuki recalled a happy memory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is, the feeling that lingered in his right hand&mdash;the softness and warmth of Hinata&rsquo;s breast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c16">Of course, Gryn-san</span><sup class="c4 c16"><a href="#ftnt129" id="ftnt_ref129">[129]</a></sup><span class="c9 c6">&nbsp;would let me squeeze them without asking, but that&rsquo;s not the point. I&rsquo;m afraid of what might happen later, so I think it&rsquo;s a little different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this respect, Hinata was wonderful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She was quite scary, but he was forgiven for something unavoidable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With this, there was no need to worry anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He could enjoy his happiness without worrying about the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Without even realizing it, Masayuki&rsquo;s happy mood had a tremendous impact on the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In response to Masayuki&rsquo;s wish, a &lsquo;Lucky Field&rsquo; was set up, granting an immense blessing for all those who stood by Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The truth of the world had been reached&mdash;the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;King of Heroes&rsquo; was in full effect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As such, Venom and the others had a relative advantage in the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Venom attacked without hesitation, as if he were strolling along on a walk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Doom Enemy&rsquo;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The claws on Venom&rsquo;s hands turned jet-black and grew long. The surface of his claws vibrated finely with a technique that generated waves that could split all matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Clicking his tongue, Arios evaded. But it didn&rsquo;t stop there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How naive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Leaving the mutter behind, Minits took aim at Arios, who had lost his stance. He tilted his body unnaturally, ignoring gravity and inertia, and rushed forward like a cannonball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With his Unique Skill &lsquo;Oppressor,&rsquo; he adjusted his trajectory to Arios, forming an obstacle-free path. He then compressed and exploded the air under his feet to gain thrust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Minits reached his maximum speed in an instant and unleashed a barrage of blows that left Arios no time to react.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You small fry, you&rsquo;re getting carried away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios, who had been head-butted in the jaw and knee-kicked in the stomach, glared at Minits in fury.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But Arios could not afford to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Assassination is my specialty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A black flash of light ripped through Arios. Jiwu, who had been hiding in perfect cover, had aimed for the moment when Arios&rsquo;s mind was turned to Minits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As Arios tried to retreat, a spear of lightning pierced him. It was Bernie&rsquo;s special strike, a condensed version of &lsquo;Thunder Rain&rsquo; fused with spearmanship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget about me, either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even though he had lost his Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative,&rsquo; it was a skill he had once acquired. Bernie had tried his best to be useful to Emperor Masayuki and was able to recreate his former abilities to some extent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The same was true for Jiwu.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, Minits had become stronger than before, but he seemed to have been empowered by experience, just as he said he loved fighting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perhaps the strength of will had something to do with the fact that people with abnormal personalities became stronger. That&rsquo;s what Bernie thought, but he wasn&rsquo;t stupid enough to say that. Right now, he honestly felt that strong friends were reassuring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, the four of them put up a good fight against Arios, who was incomparably stronger in terms of existence value.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moreover, this did not change even when Arios became serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, I don&rsquo;t have time to play around here. I&rsquo;m going to give it my all, so be prepared.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios politely declared as he held two daggers in his hands. The mythical-grade two-sword style was Arios&rsquo; original style of melee combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Damn them&hellip;they&rsquo;re only halfway competent, and yet they&rsquo;re still getting in my way&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios was indignant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios was convinced that this would be the best way to deal with the small fry without much trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It turned out that he was careless in the next attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A slash of divine speed struck Venom, slicing off the black claws that had barely caught him. Even the vibrations that cut through all matter seemed powerless before the mythical-grade weaponry&mdash;or so it seemed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As if it was a natural result, Arios kept his expression unchanged and looked at Venom with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was as if he was looking at an insect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;This is the difference in strength between you and me,&rsquo; he seemed to say with an air of pride on his face. But then it was distorted by an impossible situation. Pain shot through both of Arios&rsquo; arms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haha, look at you! I&rsquo;m lucky, I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d get two stabs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios&rsquo;s expression twitched when heard Venom&rsquo;s laughter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As Venom pointed out, Arios had one black claw in each of his arms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios was so proud of his superiority that he had looked down on Venom and the others as inferior. And yet, he had been wounded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He hadn&rsquo;t really been serious a while ago, but this time that wasn&rsquo;t the case. Arios was getting impatient because he could tell that he had not been careless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bastard, you were aiming for this?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yeah. I was hoping it would be a little more difficult, but I&rsquo;ve been lucky again today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I thought I&rsquo;d be lucky to get one,&rsquo; Venom said, making no secret of his true feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right. When one was with Masayuki, they were lucky enough to be loved every day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t the kind of luck that made you win over women or gambling, so he didn&rsquo;t always feel it, but he felt that everything he did would go better than expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn bastard&mdash;I won&rsquo;t take it easy on you anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Idiot! You just said you were going to give it your all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Venom cheerfully incited Arios, who was filled with anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Venom was now using himself as bait.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The larger the gap between Arios and his friends, the easier it would be for them to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although Venom mocked Arios with his words, in reality, he was not letting his guard down. He quickly regenerated his severed black claws and focused his attention on Arios&rsquo; movements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And rightly so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Venom was not overconfident in his power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It hadn&rsquo;t been long since he had been reincarnated as a demon, and thanks to the overwhelming presence of Diablo, he had learned to see himself from a thoroughly objective point of view.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">He&rsquo;s a tough one. Aside from this good luck, we&rsquo;re completely outclassed in terms of strength. It&rsquo;s time for me to switch places with Bernie and focus on being an attacker instead of a decoy&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This time, Venom had been assigned as a decoy because he was judged to be the most difficult to kill. Normally, Bernie played the main role of shield, so this time it was an irregular division of roles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The so-called evasive shield was the role that Venom was expected to play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would be the end if Arios&rsquo; attack hit. That&rsquo;s why it was decided that Venom was the best choice, because he was hard to hit and would not be killed instantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">&mdash;Although, it might take several hundred years to revive if I die. I seriously hope that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Venom&rsquo;s nerves sharpened as he thought about this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Bernie and his friends also understood that Venom was really desperate. That&rsquo;s why they were in no hurry to join up with him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The role of the Minits was to distract Arios with a series of big moves. It didn&rsquo;t matter if it worked or not, the goal was to keep the attack going.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Attack is the best defense,&rsquo; as the saying went, and Venom was able to get around well because of Minits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Bernie used &lsquo;cognitive inhibition&rsquo; to contain Arios&rsquo; power and keep the influence of &lsquo;Punishment King Sandalphon&rsquo; small, though not completely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This also made Minits&rsquo; attacks more effective. Of course, Jiwu also acted as a second shield, attacking at key points, and making sure that Minits could move freely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jiwu had become a true trump card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unlike Arios, Jiwu&rsquo;s concealment was of a nature that only Jiwu herself could hide from. But that was enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Needless to say, it would come in handy in battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The diminutive Jiwu activated her Skill the moment she was out of Arios&rsquo; sight. Then, when Arios was caught completely off guard, she unleashed a fatal blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, Arios was not weak enough to be defeated by such a blow, but even so, the damage was steadily accumulating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Each player&rsquo;s role had its own meaning, and Masayuki&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lucky Field&rsquo; was the perfect combo to make this happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios, who had underestimated his opponent&rsquo;s superiority, found himself unknowingly in a tight spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">It can&rsquo;t be, I&rsquo;m being pressured?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While he was feeling disgusted, the situation was worsening in earnest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was at their mercy, unaware of this as time continued passing by.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he continued like this, he would incur the wrath of Feldway. Aware of this, Arios lost his cool and became increasingly impatient&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner was rolling on the ground, screaming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But no one wanted to help Reiner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Currently, Hinata had defeated Reiner, but Feldway was still alive. Velgrynd was dealing with him, but as long as the &lsquo;Castle Guard&rsquo; was in place, her attacks wouldn&rsquo;t work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As for Reiner&rsquo;s subordinates, Moss and Cien were already holding them off. It was a surprisingly comfortable fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moss was restraining them, Cien was bringing them into a one-on-one situation, and Nicolaus was supporting them. He helped Cien by using magic to stop the enemy&rsquo;s movements, giving them an advantage in the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios had no time to spare either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why none of the Feldway forces had time to worry about Reiner. Rather, it would be more correct to say that they would not care even if they did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As proof of this, Vega, the one who had been asked for help, was smirking as he dealt with Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it okay if you don&rsquo;t help your friend?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah! He&rsquo;s a minion, not a friend. But you so have a point. Perhaps it&rsquo;s about time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa had a bad feeling when she heard Vega&rsquo;s comment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">This person, he&rsquo;s up to something&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa had noticed that Vega had been using the corpses to recover from the damage so far. But she had a feeling that he was hiding more than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That feeling was correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s misunderstanding. I still haven&rsquo;t taking things seriously. It seems that you&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to kill me, but you won&rsquo;t need to worry about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah! You&rsquo;re even dumber than I thought. I&rsquo;m telling you that you&rsquo;re no match for me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Upon hearing this, Testarossa was about to become furious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, she stopped and observed Vega with a cold gaze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">This person, he appears to be gaining strength little by little even during the current battle. I wonder if this arrogant attitude is not just a bluff?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She saw through this and refrained from acting out in anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega then declared to Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehe, Feldway-san should be getting impatient by now. All right then, I&rsquo;ll show you my best shot, so you can die in despair!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega said as such and laughed loudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He unleashed the power he had just learned to use.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was the beginning of the nightmare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Awaken, &lsquo;Evil Dragon Spawn&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega ignored Testarossa and put his hands on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a production.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was really no need for him to do so, but he dared to act in a flawed manner to show that Testarossa was match for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa would not be fooled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She was prepared to calmly analyze what was about to happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From the palm of Vega&rsquo;s hand, a wave of evil gushed forth. It traveled through the earth, engulfing Reiner&rsquo;s subordinates as they fell to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Those who were already dead and those who were still alive were equally affected. However, he just managed to avoid Elric.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Moss. Gather everyone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moss moved in response to Testarossa&rsquo;s voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He called Bernie and the others back to Masayuki&rsquo;s location to protect them from Vega&rsquo;s wave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Venom and Cien were no exception, and they all gathered in one place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They watched with bated breath as the situation unfolded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Before their eyes, the living and the dead began twisting together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then they transformed into an evil life form that emitted a foul odor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner was no exception.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-Hey! Brother&hellip;Brother Vega!! Help me, I am, I too am, in this sludge?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner was in pain but was still desperately calling out to Vega for help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But Vega only grinned at Reiner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner had been a pawn from the beginning. Therefore, he could experiment with his new power without any hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, brother. Rest assured. If you&rsquo;re useful to me, I will help you as often as I can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;R-Really?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega&rsquo;s grin deepened to a wide smile, as if to reassure Reiner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reiner, who was relieved to see this, was then attacked by the sludge made from the melted corpses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Seeing this, Arios&rsquo; face turned pale.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Vega! Y-You&rsquo;re not going to use me as your test subject, are you?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega sneered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna do this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;B-Bastard! I will never forgive you. Just because you&rsquo;re the leader of the Seven Angels doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can get away with such tyranny!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios was furious, but his lower half had already been swallowed up by the sludge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;F-Feldway-sama! Please help! Vega is out of control. At this rate, I will&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Alas, Arios&rsquo; desperate pleas were silently ignored by Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t because he was having trouble dealing with Velgrynd, but rather because he simply wasn&rsquo;t interested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides, he didn&rsquo;t see the need to stop a useless person from being strengthened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arios also sank into the sludge, leaving behind a scream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And now it was ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The corpses melted and twisted together, and the sludge formed into several humanoid forms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this moment, a fearsome creature was born into the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">It was a reappearance of the &lsquo;Demon Death (Birthday)</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt130" id="ftnt_ref130">[130]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rsquo; that produced undead elves with Vega&rsquo;s power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of course, the effect was not the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was the true value of the &lsquo;Organic Domination&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mass Reproduction&rsquo; from Vega&rsquo;s Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka,&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In Vega&rsquo;s words, it was &lsquo;Evil Dragon Spawn Production&rsquo;&mdash;it was the power to create evil lifeforms to be his loyal subjects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were four Evil Dragon Spawns born in total. Although they resembled human beings, their appearance was nothing short of hideous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Evil Dragon Spawns&rsquo; entire body was covered with black scales that were transformed from mythical-grade material. On their bellies were a large rift, reminiscent of a mouth with teeth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On their backs, there were two pairs of the blackened wings of a bird of prey. They appeared to be the remnants of an angel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The head of the creatures were distinctive, with a smooth mass from the neck up. There were two hollow-like holes in them, and red eyes glittered in the blackness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were no longer people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were writhing beings with the presence of evil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They had no heads to begin with, so there was no light of intelligence in their eyes. Nevertheless, they seemed to have the power of judgment, and were glaring hatefully at Hinata and Venom, perhaps influenced by the hatred they had felt before their deaths.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gwahahahahaha!! What do you think of my lovely pets?! It seems that you small fry have been working hard, but that&rsquo;s all over now. These &lsquo;Evil Dragon Spawns&rsquo; are far too powerful for little peons like you, so enjoy them to your hearts&rsquo; content!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega said, laughing loudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then, while crossing his arms, he ordered, &ldquo;Go play with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although Evil Dragon Spawns were a distorted life form, they were still very capable of fighting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They had no eyes, but that was no problem since they had &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo; to begin with. They could accurately grasp the situation around them and act according to orders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The individual existence values reached 2.4 million. This was more than the average Insect General, so one could understand how much of a threat these Evil Dragon Spawns were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of course, that was obvious to those who were facing them, without needing to be explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, seriously&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Venom muttered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He felt that they were in serious trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It had been tough even against Arios, but these four additions were out of the question. It was only thanks to Masayuki that the battle had been manageable, but these Evil Dragon Spawn seemed unlikely to be able to use any kind of battle tactics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Emotion had both good and bad aspects. The prideful Arios was too impatient to show his true strength. Masayuki&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lucky Field&rsquo; had been one of the factors that contributed to bringing out the worst in him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This time, however, such factors had been eliminated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The creatures&rsquo; lack of intelligence may work to their advantage, but for the Evil Dragon Spawns, who&rsquo;s only remaining assets were their offensive instincts and unparalleled fighting sense, there seemed to be no inconveniences just by being a fighting machine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Venom sensed this intuitively.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This will be very dangerous if we don&rsquo;t take things seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata spoke, breaking out in a cold sweat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Evil Dragon Spawns were dangerous, that&rsquo;s what Hinata&rsquo;s survival instincts were telling her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even Hinata&rsquo;s Phantom Pain could not penetrate the black scales that covered their outer skin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The only possible openings were the eyes and the mouth on the belly, but Hinata judged that there was little hope for that either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was why she told the Holy Knights who had gathered one after another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Attention all Holy Knights below the rank of captain. Keep a large distance from the target and get in formation! Do not let that evil being escape from this place, and do not let that Vega accumulate any more power than he already has. Isolate this area with a &lsquo;Barrier.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At this order, the Holy Knights that had arrived reacted immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For some reason, the monsters that had been rampaging all over the place suddenly melted into the ground. In order to find out the cause, they had come to the center of the disaster, where the unimaginable situation had occurred.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Seeing the Evil Dragon Spawn, which was clearly beyond their control, the Holy Knights&rsquo; morale was about to drop. However, Hinata&rsquo;s shout gave them a purpose and revived their fighting spirit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.

We&rsquo;ll show you the results of our training here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Bacchus laughed. Everyone knew that he was in a state of false cheerfulness, but the sound of his laughter seemed to give them energy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arnaud shouted at the end, bringing everyone together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Everyone nodded their heads in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They would not give up just because the enemy was out of control. If they ran away now, their futures would remain bleak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Cardinal Nicolaus and the four captains of the Holy Knight Order were leading. Following them, the members of the Holy Knight Order began to act in accordance with several training patterns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They scattered in five directions around the square, forming a five-pointed star. Then, they constructed an &lsquo;Isolation Barrier&rsquo; with the everyone&rsquo;s combined power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This time, although the enemy was evil, they did not use magicules as their energy source. Rather, although magicules were also energy, the enemy had taken in other powers, so the effect of the Holy Purification Barrier was expected to be limited. In fact, considering the presence of the monsters in this barrier, it was judged that they may be a hindrance to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Therefore, Hinata&rsquo;s choice was to use &ldquo;Material Area,&rdquo; which aimed to completely isolate this place from the rest of the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata&rsquo;s choice was supported by Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. Cien, Venom, you guys should help as well. If we don&rsquo;t reinforce the barriers even a little, they&rsquo;ll seek out bait beneath the ground.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That bait was the evacuated residents of Royal Capital.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa had hypothesized about Vega&rsquo;s abilities with some accuracy from his previous attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As long as it was within the influence of Vega&rsquo;s power, any organic matter could be used as food for Vega. So far, it had only been overlooked because it was ineffective, but there was no telling when the slaughter would start in order to recover the damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That possibility was the reason why Testarossa was holding back her attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You guys should help as well.&rdquo;<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd ordered Minits and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But we have His Majesty&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;With me here, there&rsquo;s no way anyone will be laying a finger on Masayuki.

I hadn&rsquo;t been able to fully determine the enemy&rsquo;s objective, but I was certain that they were targeting Masayuki Honjou</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt134" id="ftnt_ref134">[134]</a></sup><span class="c1">. Similarly, I guessed that Master was also a likely target.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hoho, so you&rsquo;re saying that I was used as bait?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was a rare decision for Ciel-san, who always played things too safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Huh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Are you saying that the &ldquo;double check&rdquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt135" id="ftnt_ref135">[135]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;from that time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;Yes.

In that case, it was expected that he would use Leon as bait, so I wondered how much importance Michael would place on this, and how much force he would put into it.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">S-So that&rsquo;s how it was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, it made sense when you thought about it. I had already brought Velgrynd back to her senses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael and Feldway were not so stupid as to think that Velgrynd had come back on her own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It turned out that my thinking had been too shallow&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael would have been wary of us getting Leon back and would have done something about it. Rather than worrying about Leon, he thought of a way to take advantage of the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, Michael&rsquo;s plan was to use Leon as bait to lure me out. And Ciel-san had planned this plan in anticipation of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no room for me to intervene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It may sound simple when explained, but both of them had been thinking two or three moves ahead, and even the slightest deviation in the course of events could have led to a catastrophic failure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, perhaps that was why.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If I hadn&rsquo;t come here, Michael would have taken a different approach, so it was easier for Ciel-san to read the situation by pretending to be fooled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My safety is guaranteed when Veldora is around, so it decided that it would be better for me to go along with Michael&rsquo;s plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;Yes. Of course, Master&rsquo;s safety was given the utmost consideration.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure it was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s scary that it was all going according to plan, but what even Ciel-san didn&rsquo;t calculate was that Michael also had the &lsquo;Time Stop&rsquo; ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;That was also considered as a possibility, so I negotiated with Chloe Aubert and asked her to be on standby just in case.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I see, so you guessed that Chloe would not enter the battle. But because Michael was too strong, I ended up being saved by Chloe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even Ciel-san couldn&rsquo;t foresee the situation, so there was nothing for me to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;Michael&rsquo;s ability to handle &lsquo;Time Stop&rsquo; was the biggest miscalculation.

It was fortuitous that we succeeded in developing the &lsquo;Emergency Response Mode.&rsquo; If we observe the Suspended World in this way, it will only be a matter of time before we are able to move.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That confidence is as strong as ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was only a matter of time, so I guess it was a losing battle to argue while time was stopped. I feel like I&rsquo;ll be judged otherwise, so I&rsquo;ll just praise you for this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The question was whether I could actually move when time was stopped.

It was surprisingly easy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Chloe just brushed it off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Seeing her response made me remember.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of her as my own student, Chloe was a great warrior in her own right. After a long, long journey through time, she had reigned as the strongest Hero.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She also had a Manas named Chronoa, so I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stop laughing.

And the fact that the response was gone meant that Chloe had successfully sublimated the &lsquo;Hope King Sariel&rsquo; and turned it into her power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;I didn&rsquo;t even need to help her.

This was as clear a physical phenomenon as the fact that &lsquo;all things cannot exceed the speed of light.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In that case, why did the &ldquo;information particles&rdquo; exceed the speed of light?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was not a matter of the speed being exceeded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was as if the information particles, which were supposed to be at different coordinates, were transferring information to each other with zero time difference. Regardless of how far they were from each other, as long as the information particles existed in the recognizable space, there was no time difference. In other words, an &lsquo;information particle&rsquo; transcended time and space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Our communication had also been established by using the information transfer between information particles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In that case, how can one move?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Could it possibly be&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;If it is a spiritual life form, then they must have transformed all matter into &lsquo;information particles,&rsquo; thereby resulting in a Digital Lifeform.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I knew it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Assuming that the mind and spirit are also information, it&rsquo;s not impossible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Whether it could be done or not was another matter, but it is significant that there was an answer there.

Or perhaps I should say that they were evenly matched in their ability to interfere with the &lsquo;information particles.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since the speed had a fixed maximum value, it was one&rsquo;s power of interference that determined superiority or inferiority. The key point was how well one could control the &lsquo;information particles&rsquo; and outperform the enemy. That would be the decisive factor in a &ldquo;Suspended World,&rdquo; I guessed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were a few more things that I noticed while observing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">First, there was no concept of defense in the &ldquo;Suspended World.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Those who could move, such as Chloe and Michael, could interfere with each other&rsquo;s information particles to form a unified offensive and defensive battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the other hand, those who could not move would be attacked without being able to take any defense. Moreover, the fact that time was stopped meant that all the &lsquo;forces&rsquo; were not working.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Intermolecular forces such as star attraction and repulsion would not work, and there were no binding forces. There was no inertia and no external factors, so an object retained its original state. In that case, what would happen if something was attacked in this state?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The answer was simple&mdash;it would collapse in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Whether it was a reinforced concrete wall, a solid bedrock, or a lump of steel, there was no resistance because the atoms were not even bonded to each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was nothing in this world that could endure.

From here on, she would be in her room in the labyrinth, recovering from the aftereffects of her rapid evolution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then, I grinned towards the empty space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on out, you&rsquo;re hiding, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;I thought my presence was perfectly &lsquo;concealed,&rsquo; so how did you notice?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he was asking me why, I&rsquo;d have to say it was pretty obvious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In my case, it was a hunch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was common knowledge that the moment you thought you won the battle was the moment when the opening was the largest. Therefore, I assumed that a &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; would be hidden during the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or rather, it was something I definitely would have done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In my case, unlike Velgrynd and Souei, I was unable to split my consciousness, so I couldn&rsquo;t take such a measure, but if it were possible, I would have adopted such a strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was sure that Michael would have prepared such a strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I tried to advise Chloe with that in mind, she told me that Michael was using &lsquo;Parallel Existence.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a part of Michael that Chloe had taken in. However, she received all the information on &lsquo;Justice King Michael,&rsquo; and by taking it in, she was able to find out Michael&rsquo;s plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was planning to wait for Michael to take me by surprise, but I decided not to bother. I figured I should just beat him head on and end his stupid ambitions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. Just because you&rsquo;ve read my thoughts, doesn&rsquo;t mean you saw through my skills. But even so&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael spoke to me, looking slightly surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be able to defeat my &lsquo;Parallel Existence.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yeah.

Well, you&rsquo;re done here anyway, so there&rsquo;s no need to correct you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I said as such, lightly loosening my body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It had been a while since I had fought with all my might. Just to make sure, I would do some preparatory exercises.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What nonsense. How dare you bark at me when you&rsquo;ve only been hiding behind the Hero?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one way to look at it. But you know, Chloe was my student. If I don&rsquo;t show her some dignity as a teacher, I&rsquo;ll lose my standing, won&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I replied, but Michael just gave me a cold stare with no expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The look on his face told me that he didn&rsquo;t understand me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, from the perspective of someone who could stop time, I probably wasn&rsquo;t important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that was before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Demon Lord Rimuru, you have a bad memory.

Velgrynd, are you going to take me with one hand?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Unlike you&mdash;what is that presence?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway, who had been on the defensive until now, unleashed the power he had been hiding before Velgrynd. It was just as powerful as Velgrynd&rsquo;s&mdash;no, it was even greater.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You probably thought that you had &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; anyway, but I can use it too. If you&rsquo;re planning to go help Masayuki, I&rsquo;ll do my best to stop you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsk, you still have that disgusting personality. I hate you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? That&rsquo;s a shame.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd frowned when she heard Feldway&rsquo;s curt reply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the ancient past, Feldway had been a lieutenant for her brother Veldanava, who had also complained to Velgrynd. Remembering that time, Velgrynd became even more irritated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides, the reality of the situation was harsh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd had her hands full just dealing with Feldway, and Testarossa, who was the most reliable, was facing Vega herself. In that case, there were not enough allies to go against the four Evil Dragon Spawns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">I guess I underestimated Feldway too much. Was it a mistake to leave those three out? No, it would have been impossible to maintain the &lsquo;Material Area&rsquo; otherwise&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Without Minits, Bernie, and Jiwu, the strength of the &lsquo;Material Area&rsquo; would have been weakened. In that case, there would be no way to stop Vega from forcefully rooting into the ground and feeding on the evacuated people of the Royal Capital for energy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Therefore, Velgrynd&rsquo;s orders were not wrong, but she was worried that she might have made the wrong choice because she cared about Masayuki the most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The only people who could protect Masayuki were Moss, Testarossa&rsquo;s confidant, and the &lsquo;Saint&rsquo; Hinata. She didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d be able to stop the four Evil Dragon Spawns, so Velgrynd&rsquo;s mind grew impatient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, to take on three at the same time&hellip;you can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I appreciate your understanding, but can you please stop looking at me like you&rsquo;re disappointed? I&rsquo;m trying my best too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She could hear the conversation between Hinata and Moss, which made her worry even more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata and Moss were each restraining two of them. But that was the best they could do, and it didn&rsquo;t look like they could defeat them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, this was a pretty good fight. They were only just able to deal with Evil Dragon Spawn because they had little experience in fighting them, and the two of of them were outmatched in terms of combat ability. It would be absurd to expect more than this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And Testarossa as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The &lsquo;Material Area&rsquo; is finally complete.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It means that I can now destroy you without restraint.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was all well and good until she told him so and launched her onslaught. But after that, Vega&rsquo;s indestructability made it difficult to fight him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa&rsquo;s skill-level was by far the highest. Despite the fact that Vega&rsquo;s existence value was several times greater, he was not an unbeatable opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet, Vega had evolved in the middle of the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had eaten Arios and gained his power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And now, something happened that made things worse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unbeknownst to Testarossa and the others, Michael&rsquo;s &lsquo;Time Stop&rsquo; had been activated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd and Testarossa were the only ones who felt confused by the discomfort. Both of them immediately realized what had just occurred.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even if they panicked after time began to move again, everything would already be over. Because they understood that, the two of them did not panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, there was just a small opening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And to that extent, Masayuki&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lucky Field&rsquo; should have been able to overcome it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, when she felt the strange sensation for the fourth time, something happened to Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki fell to his knees on the spot. He was exposed to sudden dizziness, but at that point, the effects of his power had disappeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Masayuki?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s worried voice rang out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hyahaha! You shouldn&rsquo;t look away from me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then Vega attacked, taking advantage of Testarossa&rsquo;s opening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata and Moss were in a difficult situation as well, because the good luck had worn off when they had already been struggling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki&rsquo;s collapse was enough to put them all in a desperate situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then came the worst moment of all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s attention turned to Masayuki, and she exposed an opening that she shouldn&rsquo;t have.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway was not so naive as to let this go unnoticed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my victory!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway shouted, his sword piercing Velgrynd&rsquo;s chest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki could not comprehend the reality of what was happening before his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The woman who smiled fearlessly, confidently, and always took care of herself no matter what the situation was, was kneeling on the ground, holding her chest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was something that should not have happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway was an outrageous monster, and he was no match for him, and if Gryn-san had been defeated, there was nothing he could do but run away&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t care about that. Masayuki reconsidered what his heart was feeling and looked once more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Intense rage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From the top of his head to the tips of his toes, he found himself feeling a rage running through his entire body, threatening to burst out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bastard, what the hell are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A quieter voice than expected spilled out of Masayuki&rsquo;s mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway reacted to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm?

In any case, I&rsquo;ll destroy Velgrynd once and for all here&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He couldn&rsquo;t finish his sentence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I asked you what the hell you were doing to my woman!&rdquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt142" id="ftnt_ref142">[142]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was because Masayuki had stepped in at an unnoticeable speed and struck Feldway in the side with his rapier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This gem had been forged by Kurobee&rsquo;s hands, mainly to reduce weight and increase strength, and was a unique grade product.

It&rsquo;s a pity that you, the most talented of all the people I&rsquo;ve worked with, have yet to become a Hero.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Hinata was told this, she was astonished to think of that person&rsquo;s &lsquo;name.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be, you&rsquo;re&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t show you then, so I&rsquo;ll show you now.

Granbell had returned to this land in his best, most powerful form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come, &lsquo;Truth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Granbell called out to his beloved sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The longsword &lsquo;Truth,&rsquo; which had been stored in subspace, appeared in Granbell&rsquo;s hand without losing its mythical-grade glow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And the next moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">An &lsquo;Overblade&mdash;True Slash&rsquo; casually sliced one of the Evil Dragon Spawns into dust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As if to ridicule Hinata&rsquo;s struggles, Granbell&rsquo;s victory was too easy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The man who had been called after Granbell knelt down before Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your Majesty, you have awakened from your long sleep, I am so very pleased!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra looked at Damrada in exasperation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re stubborn, Damrada&hellip;you, did you always have that kind of personality?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, I missed you, my friend. I went through lot of trouble because of you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry. I don&rsquo;t remember, so I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s the kind of guy you are! I knew it!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Damrada was indignant, but hot tears were flowing from in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, it was my bad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not exactly, but that&rsquo;s good enough. You&rsquo;ve kept your promise, so I&rsquo;m satisfied.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even reincarnated, Rudra was still Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra, to whom Damrada had sworn his loyalty, had rejected the control of the &ldquo;demon lord&rdquo; and aimed to establish a unified nation, a world where everyone could live happily and harmoniously by their own hands&mdash;&lsquo;The establishment of a unified nation&rsquo; was his goal. However, due to a series of tragedies, Rudra lost sight of this dream, and his heart had become worn out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He regretted the days when he was powerless to do anything for his master&mdash;But now&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this boy named Masayuki, the former Rudra had been brilliantly manifested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sight of his old master was enough to make Damrada happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? I still feel like I&rsquo;m in the middle of a dream&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, dreams do come true if you don&rsquo;t give up, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s me, yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufufu, if it&rsquo;s Rudra-sama, apparently. Well, I don&rsquo;t want to talk too long, and I don&rsquo;t want to lose to Gran either, so I&rsquo;d better get going.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Damrada, with a refreshing smile on his face, ended the conversation with Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He then stood next to Moss with an unhurried gait.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The great demon that has tormented my empire for so long, how unsightly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsk, I&rsquo;ve got my own problems at the moment&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that an excuse? Well, I&rsquo;m not interested in hearing it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re back to your old self, I see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. I have always been Rudra&rsquo;s friend and His Majesty&rsquo;s loyal servant. I can&rsquo;t help but cut corners a bit while His Majesty is away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not enemies now, but well, I guess that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moss said, shrugging lightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Smiling back at Moss, Damrada took a step forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, let&rsquo;s get this over with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">As soon as Damrada said this, he crouched down into a cat-legged stance. Putting his weight on his right foot, he became one with the earth and performed a &lsquo;warp movement</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt144" id="ftnt_ref144">[144]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rsquo; as if he were gliding across the ground. By a principle different from the ancient martial arts gait, Damrada&rsquo;s body moved forward like a cannonball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then, just like that, he crossed paths with the Evil Dragon Spawn&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&rsquo;Holy Supreme Crumbling Fist!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From the part of the body that was struck, Damrada&rsquo;s fighting spirit was transmitted to the entire body. There was no way to block it, and it disintegrated the entire spirit of Evil Dragon Spawn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m relieved to see you&rsquo;re still as good as ever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moss complimented him, sounding really unhappy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I guess it&rsquo;s your turn next.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moss agreed, thoroughly unsatisfied to his core.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moss was reminded of his old troubles and bitter memories at the sight of his adversary still alive and well, but for now, he could only do what he had to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moss hated defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was fine if he only lost, but he absolutely hated to be blamed for it by his horrible boss (Testarossa).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That alone was unacceptable, so he focused on how to fight without losing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This time, he had judged that he could not win immediately. That&rsquo;s why he was trying to buy time, but if there was only one opponent, that was a very different story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s only one, then I can win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While muttering to himself, he decided to show off his serious mode for the first time in a long time. He gathered the tiny &lsquo;Clones&rsquo; that he had scattered in the air and returned to his true form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What emerged was a beautiful man with silver hair and blue eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was the Grand Duke of Hell, second only to the primordials. That was Moss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With the growth of his master Testarossa, Moss himself was growing more powerful every day. The value of his existence has surpassed the &ldquo;1,079,397 EP&rdquo; reported to Testarossa, and he had now reached 1.5 million.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moreover, in his hands were a countless number of chakrams&mdash;the &lsquo;Infinite Loop.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the same time as Moss was evolving, the &lsquo;Infinite Loop&rsquo; had also reached the mythical-grade level. The current Moss, who had completely taken in the power of the &lsquo;Infinite Loop,&rsquo; had reached an existence value of 2.5 million, surpassing that of the Evil Dragon Spawns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If such a Moss were to get serious&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Now you die&mdash;&lsquo;Infinite Eater!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt145" id="ftnt_ref145">[145]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as Moss activated the technique, his body shuddered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He became transparent and fragmented, enveloping the Evil Dragon Spawn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Gugyah?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Looking at Moss with emotionless eyes, and then finding himself unable to move, the Evil Dragon Spawn was baffled by its inability to carry out its orders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that would only be for a short time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moss&rsquo;s attack was a dark magic that used his own body as a medium, and it also had the characteristics of a technique with the effect of his Unique Skill &lsquo;Collector.&rsquo; Its effect was to absorb the same amount of energy as himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In other words, the amount of magicule in Moss&rsquo;s body was directly converted into attack power, and although it had the disadvantage of not being able to be used again until the absorbed energy was sublimated, the &lsquo;Infinite Eater&rsquo; was his strongest attack at the moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he used it, he knew it would be useless for a while, so it couldn&rsquo;t be used in a crowded battle. Rather, it was a technique that was difficult to handle and had few uses, but in this case, it guaranteed Moss an overwhelming victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s still a hell of a move. I wonder how many of the generals have been eaten.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t use it much on the weak ones. Maybe you were in a hurry and got unlucky. In the first place, I don&rsquo;t want to hear that from someone who uses a poison that can corrupt the mind and slaughter demons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just let it out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Damrada and Moss praised each other&rsquo;s performance in a way that looked as if they were trying to humiliate each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus, Moss also won.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And the last one left was Hinata, who was casually entrusted with the sword by Granbell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Master, this is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can have it. It is no longer of any use to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With these words, Granbell gave the &lsquo;Truth&rsquo; to Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Granbell here was nothing more than a fictional entity with an actual body. In fact, the sword he had just given to Hinata had also been recreated held in his hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The ability to summon past champions in the form of entities of the same nature as &lsquo;Digital Lifeforms.&rsquo; This was the essence of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;King of Heroes&rsquo; that Masayuki had awakened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Minits and Calgurio had regained their power because of the influence of this skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And now, this time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki&rsquo;s anger had unknowingly triggered the &lsquo;Hero&rsquo;s Beacon&rsquo; to become more powerful. Rudra, the oldest and strongest of the champions, was called upon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The timing was also good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perhaps it was a coincidence, or perhaps it was an inevitability due to Masayuki&rsquo;s good fortune&hellip;When Michael&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; was defeated by Chloe, the information of the physical body that had served as a substitute was on its way back to the heavens. As a result, all of them were called by Masayuki to be integrated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, Masayuki&rsquo;s ego as Rudra had become more apparent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And Rudra was able to use Velgrynd&rsquo;s powers as his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Using Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; as a basis, Rudra did the insane thing of giving temporary bodies to the champions summoned by &lsquo;Hero&rsquo;s Beacon.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Granbell&rsquo;s new mythical-grade long sword was also created by borrowing Velgrynd&rsquo;s power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You used my power again, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that bad?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, not at all. Everything I have is yours, Rudra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">It was a show of their lovey-dovey couple-ness,</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt146" id="ftnt_ref146">[146]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;but what they were doing was completely absurd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki&rsquo;s &lsquo;King of Heroes&rsquo; was an insane power that was the ultimate balance breaker. It was no wonder that Feldway&rsquo;s face twitched as he confronted him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Be thankful. This is a divine sword given to me by my master over there, Rudra Nasca. It can&rsquo;t be compared with other dull swords. And since you&rsquo;re going to inherit it, you&rsquo;ll have to prove your merit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Granbell commanded Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My&mdash;merit, you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm. I will see if you&rsquo;re worthy of holding the sword inherited by a Hero.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Granbell nodded magnanimously to the confused Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that Granbell had said that much, there was no way for Hinata to back down. In the first place, she was a self-proclaimed defender of humanity, and she was not the kind of person who would hesitate at this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah, then rest assured. The current me will not lose even to my master.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You sure are talking big when you&rsquo;re not even at the level of these old bones. Listen, and do not forget. It is the strength of our emotions that makes us who we are. Victory is not what&rsquo;s important. It is the better outcome that matters.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The words of Granbell, who acted more for the future of humanity than for his own victory, were heavy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata chewed them over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just as she had entrusted her &ldquo;hope&rdquo; to Chloe, Granbell had entrusted his beliefs to Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata accepted it and looked forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In her line of sight, she saw the last of the Evil Dragon Spawns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata was surprised as she tried to focus her consciousness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her consciousness was changing more smoothly than usual, and the more she looked, the more the surrounding situation filled her brain. Despite this, the information was organized, and she was able to grasp the movements of Evil Dragon Spawn as if she were holding it in her hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sword and the will that had been entrusted to her; those were what brought about the change in Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Truth&rsquo; had recognized Hinata as its master and had unleashed her full power. As a result, the value of Hinata&rsquo;s existence was greatly increased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Furthermore, Granbell&rsquo;s words had washed away Hinata&rsquo;s worries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that you have yet to become a Hero&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Granbell had said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Paradoxically, it was a declaration that Hinata could become a &lsquo;Hero.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">In that is the case, I must live up to his expectations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The master, who was stricter than anyone else, had acknowledged Hinata. Her mood was uplifted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll finish you in an instant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She said as such, bidding a final farewell to the Evil Dragon Spawn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;&lsquo;True Slash!!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t even let her opponent realize that it had been slashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Countless slash marks appeared on the Evil Dragon Spawn&rsquo;s body, and at that moment, its gaze crossed with Hinata&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Hinaw&hellip;he&hellip;hewlp&mdash;&rdquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt147" id="ftnt_ref147">[147]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Evil Dragon Spawn was about to say something, but its words failed to come out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Before it could even finish, its body disintegrated into tiny pieces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perhaps the remnants of Reiner&rsquo;s consciousness had asked Hinata for help, but if he had lost his human essence at this stage, there was no way to save him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was Reiner&rsquo;s own fault, but&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Have a good night. Sweet dreams.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;Hinata threw in a few words of comfort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were many reasons why she did not like Reiner, and she didn&rsquo;t think she could forgive him for what he had done, but she hoped at the least that he would be at peace when he died.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this way, Hinata&rsquo;s victory was confirmed, and Evil Dragon Spawns were annihilated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The victorious Hinata was greeted by Granbell with a round of applause.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well done.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it was because my master lent me his sword.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Granbell stopped Hinata from giving &lsquo;Truth&rsquo; back to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is yours now. I am already dead. The &lsquo;me&rsquo; here is nothing more than a fake, a perfect reproduction created from memories.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It didn&rsquo;t look like it, but Hinata knew it was true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The boy who inherited my master&rsquo;s &lsquo;soul&rsquo; has created an extraordinary power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that said, Granbell smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was not a resurrection from the dead, but it was, if anything, an even more terrifying power. The ability to recreate the champions of the past in their prime&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even if the power was limited to those who had a relationship with Masayuki, it would still be an absurd story. Moreover, there was a strong possibility that he would be able to call upon even those who had no connection to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the very least, Granbell and Masayuki were not acquainted with each other. Even so, he was able to summon them because Hero Rudra, who was said to be a past life of Masayuki, had been Granbell&rsquo;s mentor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even Hinata had only just heard of this story, and Masayuki should have known nothing about it. To begin with, it was unclear as to how many people could be summoned at the same time, and she had to admit that it was an unfathomable ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was only natural that Granbell, who stood here from Masayuki&rsquo;s power, had no regrets about the sword he was leaving behind in this world. Even so, Hinata was not sure that she was worthy to hold it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand that Master is an illusion, but that&rsquo;s not the point. In the end, I couldn&rsquo;t become a &lsquo;Hero.&rsquo; My qualifications were passed on to Chloe, and unfortunately, I was never meant to awaken&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Hero&rsquo;s Egg that Hinata carried had been passed on to Chloe to give birth to the strongest Hero. Therefore, the current Hinata would never awaken, and could not live up to Granbell&rsquo;s expectations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Knowing this, Hinata showed off her current self to Granbell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Through this, one could see Hinata&rsquo;s strong will that she does not mind being disappointed. She was declaring to Granbell that she had nothing to be ashamed of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Granbell laughed at such a Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was my master Rudra&rsquo;s will that I be called, but I suppose it was inevitable. I remembered from the &lsquo;Promised Land&rsquo; that I was unable to entrust you with my will either. Maria was very angry with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This conversation itself was an illusion told by a fake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet, it was still so concrete and vivid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then, Hinata realized the meaning of Granbell&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Huh?! This power is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Granbell&rsquo;s qualification as a Hero&mdash;the Holy Spirit of Light that guided those to victory, had been handed over to Hinata along with &lsquo;Truth.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is where my role ends. Hinata, I&rsquo;ll leave rest is up to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Granbell spoke, smiling with a freshness that had never been shown in his lifetime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata vowed by that smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rest assured, Master. I will do my best.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, good!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Granbell said and gave a small smile. Then he turned his back on Hinata, as if his business was done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Damrada stood alongside Granbell as he walked toward Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gran, are you finished satisfying your regrets?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. You also seem to have complained to Rudra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh, he didn&rsquo;t listen to me, as usual.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, definitely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The two of them appeared to be on good terms with each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It made one think that this was the way things were in the ancient past, the way things should have been.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, it was the truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Granbell had studied under Rudra and parted company to unite the West.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After the West was united, he was scheduled to return to Rudra&rsquo;s service.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Granbell&rsquo;s struggle with the monsters of power who dominated many nations had exhausted him greatly. The empire that he had set up as a virtual enemy eventually became a real threat to Granbell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">And so, trapped in his own madness, he, and his friend Damrada became nothing more than superficial friends who played tricks on each other&hellip;until today</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt148" id="ftnt_ref148">[148]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Those petty ties were no longer relevant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just like in the old days, they were simply laughing and talking to each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Without a doubt, this was not something a mere illusion could do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra was waiting for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, hey, you guys aren&rsquo;t going to speak trash right in front of me, are you? You&rsquo;d better prepare yourselves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm, we were complimenting you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. We can&rsquo;t do anything without you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsk, you&rsquo;re making me sick. Well, that&rsquo;s fine then. It&rsquo;s my turn now, so get some rest until I call you back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Granbell and Damrada laugh back, and then disappear. They left, satisfied that their part in the story was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra, who was entrusted with the rest, accepted their trust without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rudra, are you okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra smiled at Velgrynd&rsquo;s concern, hugged her around the waist and even kissed her lightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this is the time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu, I&rsquo;ll be gone once this is over. I just got my reward first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd stared at Rudra in ecstasy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She adored the naive Masayuki for his innocence, but Rudra, the man she had once loved, was exceptional.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Someday, Masayuki would become Rudra. Velgrynd had always believed that, but she never thought that her dream would come true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It may seem contradictory, but those were here true feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because she could love any Rudra, the original was the best&mdash;Masayuki, who recreated such a Rudra, had become a supreme being for Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The word &ldquo;love&rdquo; was no longer enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I love Masayuki. All of you, Rudra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know. So those words shouldn&rsquo;t be said to me, but to Masayuki himself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, that kid, he&rsquo;s a bit shy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s happy on the inside. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m&rsquo; the one who said it, so I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yes, those words were also true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The current Rudra was not an illusion, but Masayuki himself with Rudra&rsquo;s memories.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra then turned to Feldway as if to hide his embarrassment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, sorry to keep you waiting, Feldway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Apparently, you&rsquo;re the real deal. Do you intend to defy the laws of this world and say that you&rsquo;ve transcended &lsquo;death&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m still dead and there&rsquo;s no coming back to life. However, I can hit a man from the other side if he makes the woman I love cry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious though? Well, I haven&rsquo;t gone to the other side yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra&rsquo;s statement, though said in a joking manner, was quite true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because he was dwelling within Masayuki like this, as long as Michael&rsquo;s body was still incarnated, not all of his memories would be recreated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as the effects of Masayuki&rsquo;s power expired, Rudra&rsquo;s &ldquo;personality&rdquo; would disappear. However, his memories and experiences would remain in Masayuki&rsquo;s heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This meant that Rudra could continue to manifest himself. Rudra was not so sincere as to tell him this, but he had no intention to hide it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Muttering to himself, Rudra glanced at Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then, turning to Testarossa and Hinata, he gave them an order with an expectant look.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, you guys. I&rsquo;ll leave that small fry to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Naturally, the two rebelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So high and mighty&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, it was in their best interest to follow Rudra&rsquo;s lead, and they were not so stupid as to not understand that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why it felt even worse, but in this case, they chose to follow him quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let us go with a united front, Hinata-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Testarossa-san. With you as a partner, I can rest assured.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufufu, it is the same for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, an impromptu duo was formed to take on Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega vs. Testarossa &amp; Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway vs. Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The final battle in the Royal Capital had begun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Two beautiful women stood in front of Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa was smiling bewitchingly, while Hinata was smiling coldly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to finish him off, so would you mind keeping him occupied for a while?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, of course. He seems to be difficult to kill with a sword, and widespread annihilation magic cannot be used in Royal Capital, so let&rsquo;s share the work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As smart people, it was easy for them to come to an agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa stepped back and began to search for the range of influence of the power that Vega had activated. That tended to be neglected while fighting, but this time, she activated her detection spell carefully in order to kill him seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata stood in front of Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh hey, what happened to my buddy Damrada and the other bastard?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They have gone back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, I see. They looked like they were going to do some damage, but they&rsquo;re not my enemy. Neither are you guys. You got carried away just because you beat my Evil Dragon Spawns, but let me give you a reality check.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega boasted to Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a former colleague, Damrada had felt that Vega was quite capable. However, he had thought that the current Vega was no match for him and did not consider him a threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even so, he felt that it would be annoying to be swarmed by such a strong class of people, so Hinata&rsquo;s words that Damrada had gone back honestly made him happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, it was just that it was less troublesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, what do you think? Don&rsquo;t underestimate me, or you&rsquo;ll regret it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even Hinata could see that Vega was a very powerful opponent. Normally, Hinata would try to instigate things from the start, but she understood that it would be ridiculous for her to say such a thing now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The right thing to do was to win and show her strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as the exchange was over, Vega moved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He chose to use his greatly increased strength and speed to confront Hinata head on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega&rsquo;s stiff arm destroyed an object with a shock wave even though it had not been touched. The same went for his kicks. His entire body had become an incarnation of destruction that surpassed that of strategic weapons, and he was causing extraordinary damage to those around him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If it weren&rsquo;t for the &lsquo;Material Area,&rsquo; the capital would have been reduced to ashes in a matter of minutes. Exposed to such a tyranny, Hinata would normally have been in great trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, Hinata&rsquo;s existence value had increased significantly, but Vega&rsquo;s rate of increase was even greater. The difference was more than tenfold, and he even possessed the Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even though Granbell had awakened her as a Hero, Vega was still too dangerous for Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet, Hinata was unfazed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">It&rsquo;s strange. I&rsquo;m not scared at all. And for some reason, I can read the flow of attacks&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was more accurate than the &lsquo;Predict Future Attack&rsquo; that Rimuru had mastered and could now be called &lsquo;Future Prediction.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was no wonder, then, that Hinata&rsquo;s current Skill was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;Confirmed. Unique Skill &lsquo;Mathematician&rsquo; has evolved into Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Fate King Fortuna&rsquo;&hellip;Successful.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With the evolution of Hinata herself, she had reached the ultimate realm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This &lsquo;Fate King Fortuna&rsquo; included the abilities &lsquo;Thought Acceleration,&rsquo; &lsquo;Universal Perception,&rsquo; &lsquo;Divine Haki,&rsquo; &lsquo;Spacetime Manipulation,&rsquo; &lsquo;Multidimensional Barrier,&rsquo; &lsquo;All of Creation,&rsquo; &lsquo;Computational Domain,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Virtual World.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By making full use of these powers, Hinata was able to embody an almost perfect &lsquo;Future Prediction.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was only through this power that Hinata was able to master Granbell&rsquo;s sword technique&mdash;&lsquo;True Slash.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata had lost her Unique Skill &lsquo;Usurper,&rsquo; but because she had made &lsquo;Fate King Fortuna&rsquo; her own with such talent, she did not need it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata was able to see through all of Vega&rsquo;s tricky attacks, including altering himself and branching his arms. Even when Vega was several times faster than her, Hinata was able to toss him around with ease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it, you&rsquo;re just jumping around!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No matter how terrible Vega&rsquo;s shockwaves were, they wouldn&rsquo;t do much damage to Hinata if it didn&rsquo;t hit her directly, especially now that she was able to turn into a full spiritual life form as a Hero. Of course, if it was Vega, whose entire body was hardened with mythical-grade armor, he might be able to kill Hinata with just one blow. However, Hinata now had &lsquo;Truth&rsquo; in her hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Until now, it would have been difficult for her to even take him on seriously, considering the difference in weapon performance, but with &lsquo;Truth,&rsquo; there was no need to worry about that. Combined with Hinata&rsquo;s &lsquo;Future Prediction&rsquo; calculation, it was possible to parry Vega&rsquo;s attacks head-on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although the difference in strength was too great and there was a need to adjust the angle, it was an easy task given Hinata&rsquo;s skill level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to hit me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it! However, even you don&rsquo;t have the means to reach me!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega shouted, unwilling to admit defeat, but he still had a point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But there was no need for Hinata to be ashamed of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, that&rsquo;s what Testarossa was there for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very helpful to have a good vanguard. I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, please go ahead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. There&rsquo;s no need for repentance, you can go straight to purgatory.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vega&rsquo;s survival instincts told him that he was in trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t screw with me! W-Wait! Wait for&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But Testarossa did not listen to Vega&rsquo;s pleas for his life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;&rsquo;White Flare&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa had created the ultimate magic interpersonal magic with her Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Death King Belial&rsquo;&mdash;that is, the &lsquo;White Flare.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It consumed life and reaped death. There was no escape for those who had been targeted by it, their bodies would be consumed by the white flames, and they would be cast into hell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a terrible magic that caused no damage to the surrounding area, but its power and heat level surpassed that of nuclear magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although this terrifying magic caused no damage to the surroundings, the power&mdash;that is, the amount of heat easily surpassed that of nuclear magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was nothing he could do about it; Vega was burned to the ground in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;But Testarossa&rsquo;s expression was dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;the worst. Apparently, it seems that I&rsquo;ve failed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She muttered gravely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overhearing this, Hinata asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was unable to reap that fool&rsquo;s soul. Perhaps if it were anyone else, but my eyes can&rsquo;t be deceived.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Vega died, Testarossa took in a massive amount of &lsquo;soul.&rsquo; However, there was no scent on it that could be attributed to Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata thought to herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">That magic was of a terrible nature. Even I think it would be difficult to withstand. Would I be able to escape it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If it were her, she would definitely be defeated the moment the spell was activated. Hinata admitted this but then retracted her argument when she remembered Vega&rsquo;s attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;or rather, it&rsquo;s likely, I&rsquo;m almost certain that they&rsquo;ve escaped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You think so too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Because that guy seemed like he was acting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. The begging for his life wasn&rsquo;t as desperate or sneaky as it should have been.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa had heard a lot about Vega&rsquo;s despicable behavior from Moss. He was a cowardly bastard who would immediately pull the trigger if he knew he was at a disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The fact that such a man did not stop looking down on her until the end assured her that he did not think he would die.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the worst. I&rsquo;m so embarrassed, I don&rsquo;t think I can face Rimuru-sama&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Testarossa was writhing in shame over her mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so was Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, I can just see Rimuru&rsquo;s face, so happy to hear my story. Just great, that guy, he&rsquo;s always so delighted when I fail&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m always right&rsquo;&mdash;with an expression like that, Rimuru was very pleased when Hinata was in trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She hated him for that, but at the same time, she was pleased that he was happy whenever she relied on him. Hinata had mixed feelings about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moss, who was listening to the conversation of these women, thought in silence as if he were air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;If I do it, I&rsquo;ll be tormented for three hundred years or so&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he was thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To say that he had let the enemy escape&mdash;he was too scared to report it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, Moss was not foolish enough to point out his superior&rsquo;s mistake here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He knew from the bottom of his heart that if he did such a thing, he would be blamed for not keeping a watchful eye on things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Ahhh, if other executives blame me, Testarossa-sama will be in trouble&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For the time being, Moss was depressed, expecting that his boss would be in a bad mood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the very least, he secretly hoped that he would not be the one to bear the brunt of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra leisurely takes off his Emperor&rsquo;s coat and left it in Velgrynd&rsquo;s hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now wearing a shirt, he looked at Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come, &lsquo;Deva&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra&rsquo;s favorite sword from his Hero days answered his call.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a sacred sword, given to Rudra by his friend and mentor, Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Its grade was the highest of all mythical-grade swords. The &lsquo;Asura&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Deva&rsquo; were a pair of swords that could be boasted as most powerful swords ever made.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While the &lsquo;Asura,&rsquo; which was given to Guy and later to Milim, was a long, curved, single-edged sword, the &lsquo;Deva&rsquo; was a normal-sized, double-edged sword. Because of its ease of use, it was a perfect match for Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That sword is Veldanava-sama&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I got it from him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;That&rsquo;s unforgivable. It&rsquo;s too valuable to be wasted on a mere mortal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do I care?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra walked towards Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd watched anxiously but did not wish to interfere. She believed in Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So then, you&rsquo;re still a coward, huh? You&rsquo;re the type of person who would never use all your strength to decide between two people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What does that matter? The leader must outlive everyone else. You&rsquo;re well aware of that, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I suppose. But if that&rsquo;s the reason why you miss the chance to win a battle you could&rsquo;ve won, it&rsquo;s not worth it, is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, what are you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful. If you hadn&rsquo;t relied on the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; and fought Gryun on your own, she would&rsquo;ve been injured much worse.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, I won&rsquo;t forgive you for hurting her. Prepare yourself!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By the time he finished, Rudra was in close proximity to Feldway. He casually swung his sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway caught it with his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">The sword, just like with Rudra and Guy, was given to Feldway by Veldanava. It was a masterpiece named the &ldquo;Ark.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt149" id="ftnt_ref149">[149]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The grade of the swords was the same. The rest of the battle would be decided by skill level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The ground was shattered by the footsteps and even the air was broken by the impact of running through the sky. The impact of the swords clashing was so great that the smell of burning air filled the surroundings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tremendous&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata muttered, who was now one of the spectators.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata&rsquo;s mentor, Granbell, respected Rudra as a master, and his power was real. Despite the fact that he was inhabiting the fragile body of Masayuki, his power was equal to that of Feldway&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, it was more than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After several clashes, Feldway was the one who was outmatched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re weak, bastard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare make a fool of me, Rudra!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, that&rsquo;s what happens when you rely too much on your skills. I knew you were trying to copy me, but you can&rsquo;t be that naive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra&rsquo;s sword flicked Feldway&rsquo;s sword away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was an overwhelming difference in ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; is a complete defense in the truest sense of the word. I had been using it for a long time, so I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, while it&rsquo;s active, you can&rsquo;t take any offensive measures, right? No magic, no other powers, no fighting spirit (aura). You can&rsquo;t even use magic to deflect attacks. However&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was a loophole.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although it was impossible to blow off attacks with things like fighting aura, the overwhelming power of Haki was effective. Besides, he could attack with hand-held weapons without a problem, though that was the main concern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra was proficient in this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was so skilled that he was able to release the Castle Guard only at the moment of attack and increase the power through his fighting aura.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You knew that, so you misunderstood that you were in a one-sided position, but it was a strategy that was possible because you were me. If you&rsquo;re not the best with a sword, you&rsquo;ll easily lose your means of attack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His words hit the nail on the head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway knew this because he had been a member of Rudra&rsquo;s inner circle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Therefore, when he acquired the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Justice King Michael,&rsquo; he tried to recreate that power, but it was not so easy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was not a skill that Rudra had learned overnight, but rather a method of combat that he had learned over and over again while being beaten down by his master, Veldanava. That&rsquo;s why it was a great achievement to even be able to imitate him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides, losing a sword fight did not mean that the Castle Guard had been broken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway was still intact and he had not lost his overall advantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Yes, I&rsquo;ll admit to your point. However, don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve won.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway spoke arrogantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was so confident in his own defense that he believed he would never be defeated. However, Rudra replied to Feldway as if to ridicule him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You really think you can beat me, don&rsquo;t you? Do you have any idea how many years I spent with Veldanava after he entrusted me with &lsquo;Justice King Michael?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you if you really think that I didn&rsquo;t come up with a way to attack it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You fool. Do you think there&rsquo;s any way to defeat the most powerful of all Angelic, no, Ultimate Skills? You can&rsquo;t bluff your way through me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even so, Rudra only snickered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then he narrowed his eyes and thrust his sword at Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something. What I received was the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel,&rsquo; what do you think its characteristics were?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a power for management purposes. Veldanava-sama used the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; to figure out how to create his many powers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Upon being asked by Rudra, Feldway answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was the correct answer, but it did not express the whole truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to it than that. As you may know, the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; also had the ability to listen to the voices of the people. Or rather, the voices of those connected to Veldanava. It could be a wish for hope, a prayer for salvation, or any number of other desires, but it didn&rsquo;t lose its power when I had it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;So what do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;See the resemblance? With the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; you&rsquo;re using now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As long as there was loyalty to its owner, the &lsquo;Castle Guard&rsquo; was invincible. In other words, the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; were similar in the sense that they listened to the voices of those who were connected to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; also has an &lsquo;Absolute Defense&rsquo; which is an application of the &lsquo;Infinite Prison&rsquo; and can be broken at the critical moment. I&rsquo;m proud to say that the means of attack I devised by using it was quite impressive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra grinned after saying this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He lightly swung the &lsquo;Deva&rsquo; in his hand, making its blade glow with light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;You can &ldquo;see&rdquo; it, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt150" id="ftnt_ref150">[150]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mmm&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Upon seeing the light, Feldway&rsquo;s face changed color.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He realized at a glance that it had the same properties as the &lsquo;Castle Guard&rsquo; he wore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The more people who believe in me, the more power I have. How many of your followers do you have? I&rsquo;ve got over a billion people counting on me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra&rsquo;s words were true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The total number of Feldway&rsquo;s followers was less than a million. The number of those who believed in Feldway had been greatly reduced and was now believed to be less than 300,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the other hand, the number of those who believed in Rudra reached 800 million among the subjects of the Empire alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here in the royal capital of Ingracia alone, millions of people had placed their hope in Rudra. Rather, it was for Masayuki, but since they were the same person, it was accepted without any issues.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was a huge gap between Rudra and Feldway in regards to the absolute number of supporters they had. Feldway&rsquo;s face twisted in frustration as he realized this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is the deadly blow that will unleash the united will of those who believe in me&mdash; &lsquo;Absolute Severance&rsquo;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway could sense the danger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quite screwing around!! How can you use the power of the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo;?! It&rsquo;s still missing&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Veldanava died, the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; was supposed to be lost. And yet, Rudra was using it as if it were only natural.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was an unacceptable situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not paying enough attention. For that matter, that Gran guy was using &lsquo;Hope King Sariel&rsquo; too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra told him in utter exasperation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki&rsquo;s &lsquo;King of Heroes&rsquo; could even recreate skills that had disappeared. Rudra smiles broadly, as if it didn&rsquo;t matter what he told them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t like these tactics, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was also exasperated, but more than that, she was in love with Rudra&rsquo;s bravery, and in the end, no one other than Rudra&rsquo;s sister Lucia had ever cautioned him. This was a scene that had been repeated in the past, and it was being recreated precisely now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If so, then you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I can use the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; right now, but the one who&rsquo;s going to end you here is the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; who boasts the strongest attack power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Che&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway was on full alert, mobilizing not only the Castle Guard but also all of his &lsquo;Barriers&rsquo; in a defensive posture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And immediately after that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting. Let&rsquo;s see how long you can hold out!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At Rudra&rsquo;s voice, the ultimate blow was unleashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to work, Rudra&mdash;ah!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Star King Dragon Flash, &lsquo;Nova Break&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The clash was instantaneous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A terrifying rampage of destruction erupted on the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Material Area&rsquo; meant nothing. Even though Velgrynd had contained the main shockwave and sent it skyward, it was still shattered in the aftermath.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was not the kind of power that could be generated by mere swordplay, but this was what made Rudra, Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Irrational strength, that was the power of the &ldquo;hero of the beginning&rdquo; who could compete with Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And of course, it was Feldway who fell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a fair result.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra smiled refreshingly and raised his right hand to the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was, without a doubt, a declaration of victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">*</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway fell to his knees and coughed up blood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His blood was crimson, staining his pure white robes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-It can&rsquo;t be, I&rsquo;m the one&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too conceited, Feldway. It&rsquo;s always been that way, but you&rsquo;ve always thought you had to be the best in everything you do. That&rsquo;s why you lose sight of the essential.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me puke&hellip;I don&rsquo;t need to be told what to do by someone who&rsquo;s a shell of his former self!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. That&rsquo;s why I can understand some things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The victor and the vanquished fell silent and stared at each other for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway was the next to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;There will be no next time. Today&rsquo;s defeat will be your last.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And with that, he stood up as if the injury he had just sustained had never happened in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If it weren&rsquo;t for the crimson flowers blooming on his clothing, one would have thought that the attack from Rudra&rsquo;s sword had been an illusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still as stubborn as ever. Well, I&rsquo;ll always win, no matter how many times you come, so be my guest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The two men looked at each other again, and then away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway turned his back on Rudra, and ordered Mai, who had been waiting at a distance, to disappear from the scene with &lsquo;Instantaneous Movement.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Not only the &lsquo;Material Area,&rsquo; but also the &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; of the Royal Capital had been destroyed, so it was impossible to prevent his escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, it was a good decision not to pursue him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even though he was wounded, Feldway still had a lot of power left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although he had been mentally cornered by the defeat from Rudra, his fighting ability was still sufficient. If it had not been for the defeat of the invincible &lsquo;Castle Guard,&rsquo; he would not have chosen to flee so easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Feldway swore revenge on Rudra, never forgetting today&rsquo;s humiliation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now then, as for the victorious Rudra&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Great job, Rudra!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra&rsquo;s face was pressed against Velgrynd&rsquo;s chest, and he seemed to be in no mood to complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, upon a closer look, it was something else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was blushing and his eyes were spinning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t Rudra anymore&mdash;he was back to Masayuki again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had used up all his soul power when he had unleashed the &lsquo;Nova Break,&rsquo; and it had become difficult for him to maintain his Rudra persona. That was the reason why he had missed Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rather, until Feldway&rsquo;s departure, Rudra&rsquo;s personality had only been maintained through sheer force of will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata walked up to Masayuki, who had been released from Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you, First-sama.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt151" id="ftnt_ref151">[151]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;My name is Hinata Sakaguchi. Before you leave, I wanted to say a few words&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the middle of Hinata&rsquo;s greeting, the noise of the people began to be heard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Seeing how strong Rudra was, they were excited that Masayuki had taken things seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a misunderstanding, but to those who did not know the situation, it was the truth. When they saw that the battle was over, they came rushing to the area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Once they were within a certain distance, they formed a circle around Masayuki. This was the result of Minits and the others taking the lead and holding back the people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Wow, Masayuki-san&rsquo;s so cool!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I saw it for the first time! The true &lsquo;beacon of light.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I had no idea what was going on, but I could tell it was awesome!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, naturally, the credit went to Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because Reiner and the others had made the video available, there were many people in the capital who had witnessed the entire thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">No, that wasn&rsquo;t me!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">&lsquo;No, it was me, but&rsquo;&mdash;Masayuki&rsquo;s inner thoughts were in turmoil. However, he activated on his &lsquo;it-never-happened skill&rsquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt152" id="ftnt_ref152">[152]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;and succeeded in making a face that seemed to say, </span><span class="c6 c16">&ldquo;It was only natural, and so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How on earth did this happen? That was Masayuki&rsquo;s current state of mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From Masayuki&rsquo;s point of view, Rudra had done everything on his own. Even though he was told that he was amazing, it didn&rsquo;t really feel like it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was difficult for him to accept such praise without thinking of himself as another person, but the people didn&rsquo;t understand his feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you for your hard work. You looked great, Masayuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd handed him a jet-black, gold-embroidered Emperor&rsquo;s robe, and he put it on while thinking.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Velgrynd handed him a jet-black, gold-embroidered Emperor&rsquo;s robe, and as he put it on, he tried to think. It was embarrassing to be the center of public attention, but he also had a feeling that there was trouble to come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To be more specific, the knights of the capital had arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Wow, this is going to be troublesome&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As Masayuki&rsquo;s escort, Minits was acting as a negotiator. He seemed to be refusing the request, saying that if they wanted an audience with His Majesty the Emperor, they should talk to them first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He listened to the conversation, thinking that his escorts were very reliable, but the content of the conversation was very disturbing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It sounded like the king had been assassinated, but Masayuki had nothing to do with it. Masayuki&rsquo;s heart continued to pound as he heard something about an important witness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had been through a lot of hardships, and now he was able to accept any difficulties naturally&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he had thought, but now he realized that that was an exaggeration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although he has gotten accustomed to the nervous tension of public appearances, Masayuki was still a bit of a coward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Not to mention, he&rsquo;d rather not be suspected of murder&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I seem to have gotten you involved in our situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata, noticing that Rudra had reverted back to Masayuki, softly apologized.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Reiner murdered King Aegil and blamed me for his sins.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;No way,&rsquo; Masayuki thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">That&rsquo;s such a big deal!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was hard to be involved in such an incident and accept it. But it was also impossible to pretend that he had nothing to do with it now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even if he wanted to complain, there was no one to complain to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, Masayuki was the most important person here right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki had no choice but to take charge of the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As the crowd continued to cheer, Masayuki took a step forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then, as he always did in practice, he tilted his head at an angle and looked down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After a two-second pause, he turned his head to the front and looked at the audience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just by doing this, the excitement of the people was palpable. It was frighteningly effective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">As expected, it&rsquo;s exactly as Rimuru-san told me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki&rsquo;s current gesture was the result of Rimuru&rsquo;s guidance&mdash;or rather, it was the result of practice based on Ciel&rsquo;s production.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By adding the gestures that were calculated to win the hearts of the people, the effect of his Skill was increased. And now that it had evolved into the &lsquo;King of Heroes,&rsquo; the effect was enormous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone, please calm down. I need you to stay composed and tell me what happened&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Masayuki quietly began to speak, the excited people fell silent at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Like a receding wave, the entire area was enveloped in silence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki was inwardly horrified at the unimaginable impact of his influence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was the achieved effect after only a small amount of performance guidance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With nothing to do but to laugh at the situation, Masayuki resolved to continue his performance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">Uh okay, don&rsquo;t panic and take your time. Even if you stutter or choke a little, it&rsquo;s fine because there&rsquo;s a way to fix it!&mdash;was that it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ever since he decided to become Emperor, Rimuru had consulted him many times. There were many other people who supported Masayuki, and he was now able to play the role reasonably well. It never occurred to those who were watching him intently that Masayuki was actually really nervous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone! What is right and what is wrong? I think it should be obvious from this scene. If you are wise, you will know the right answer without me saying anything. I ask that you believe in that answer, and I want to believe in you, too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki didn&rsquo;t think he was explaining himself very well. Nevertheless, he was convinced that it would have a significant effect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because that was the effect of Masayuki&rsquo;s &lsquo;King of Heroes.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t know what the right answer was, but at the least, he wanted to avoid the hostility of the people. It seems that he succeeded in doing so and decided to take this opportunity to lead the people in a cynical manner so as not to be taken advantage of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">It&rsquo;s perfect. I didn&rsquo;t say anything important, so I can&rsquo;t be blamed if I&rsquo;m wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki praised himself inwardly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As Masayuki began to speak, the crowd that had been in an uproar suddenly calmed down. Along with that, Minits came up to Masayuki with a knight in tow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was a large man with a stern face and metal armor all over his body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki was scared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, the knight saluted Masayuki with the highest of respect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is my great pleasure to have an audience with His Majesty Masayuki, Champion of my Kingdom of Ingracia and Emperor of the Great Eastern Empire!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki was overwhelmed and just nodded his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, he felt compelled to say what he needed to say and opened his mouth to the knight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um, King Aegil&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had heard that the King of Aegil was killed, but it wasn&rsquo;t Hinata-san who did it&mdash;He was about to continue, but the knight interrupted him and spoke up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please rest assured! If His Majesty Masayuki is on her side, then the suspicions about Hinata-dono can be cleared! Rather, we, the knights of Ingracia, would never suspect Hinata-dono!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The knight laughed loudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So then, have we identified the culprit?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hinata glanced at Prince Elric.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had been trembling behind the fountain ever since the battle had started, but Moss had moved him out of the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was not a kindness, but an instruction from Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was an act to secure the culprit, and not to allow him to escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Seeing such a situation, anyone with an intelligent mind would have been able to guess who was behind this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It may be true that the king was murdered, but was Hinata really the culprit?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">These were the questions that came to the peoples&rsquo; minds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Prince Elric was certainly a popular man, but it was only by looking at the sequence of events that the full picture of what had happened became clear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki knew nothing about the incident, but Hinata had been looking at Prince Elric. At that moment, he looked up and she met Elric&rsquo;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fu-Fuhahahahaha&hellip;It&rsquo;s all over now, I&rsquo;m ruined&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elric suddenly started laughing as Masayuki looked at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then, for some reason, he took the liberty of confessing his misdeeds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">No, what? I don&rsquo;t understand the situation, but what&rsquo;s going on?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was just that Elric misunderstood that he had seen through everything and self-destructed on his own. Unbeknownst to Masayuki, he decided to hide his inner turmoil and continue acting as if he understood everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, the situation came to an end with a furious turn of events.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems that Masayuki-sama has identified the culprit and solved the problem&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Prince Elric killed His Majesty the King, his father&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The mastermind behind it was Reiner, the former Commander of the Knight Order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Hinata-sama&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Reiner was the bastard who blundered at the council meeting, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, how shameful of the former Commander of the Knights of Ingracia.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, then he was trying to take revenge on Hinata-sama with the help of a monster?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But it was our Masayuki-sama who saw through that and resolved Hinata-sama&rsquo;s dilemma!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As expected of hero-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even though he became the Emperor of the Eastern Empire, he still remembered us!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The prince&rsquo;s confession was decisive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The people were convinced without needing any explanation from Masayuki or Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hurray, Masayuki-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Glory to our Masayuki-sama!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Such cheers naturally arose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It quickly spread among the people, and the chorus began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Ma-sa-yu-ki, Ma-sa-yu-ki, Ma-sa-yu-ki!!&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And it wasn&rsquo;t long before the Royal Capital was filled with the usual cheers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With one hand raised awkwardly and his cheek twitching, Masayuki responded to the people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The contrast between Hinata&rsquo;s slightly dumbfounded expression and Velgrynd&rsquo;s satisfied look was striking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Masayuki&rsquo;s inner self was filled with tears and screamed &lsquo;Whatever, I don&rsquo;t care anymore!&rsquo;&mdash;but that&rsquo;s just the way things always were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Incidentally, the next day, Masayuki suffered terrible pains from the aftereffects of harboring Rudra, as well as from a variety of other reasons, regardless of the use of restoration magic&mdash;This included a very rare kind of growing pain called &ldquo;soul pain,&rdquo; but he had no way of knowing that now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael was acutely aware of his own naivety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To be honest, at first he had thought that the Demon Lord Rimuru was insignificant. That changed the moment Rimuru defeated Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From then on, he regarded him as an enemy and took extra precautions. Even so, he still thought that he would not be much of an enemy in a head-on battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But now, Michael had no choice but to admit that he had been naive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, the Demon Lord Rimuru had entered the &ldquo;Suspended World,&rdquo; a place that only a limited number of people were allowed to enter, without permission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">What a troublesome guy. He&rsquo;s always getting in my way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At this point, there was no point in stopping time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael lifted the &lsquo;Time Stop&rsquo; and decided to crush Rimuru with an overwhelming difference in power. The &lsquo;Time Stop&rsquo; had been obtained by analyzing Velzard&rsquo;s &lsquo;Patience King Gabriel,&rsquo; but it was useless to someone who could manipulate information particles at will. Since maintaining it would only consume unnecessary energy, he decided that it would be more advantageous to fight in a straightforward manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, Michael has gained great power by taking in the factors of the two &ldquo;True Dragons.&rdquo; His body had been strengthened to the point of invincibility, and he was overflowing with energy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And that wasn&rsquo;t all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael, as befitting of the head of the Angelic Ultimate Skills, was able to fully display all the powers he had analyzed and taken in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">From Velzard&rsquo;s &lsquo;Patience King Gabriel,&rsquo; the concept of &lsquo;fixation</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt153" id="ftnt_ref153">[153]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rsquo; had given him an unrivaled and powerful defensive ability. It was not as powerful as Castle Guard, but it was more useful in that it could be used to attack at the same time. Moreover, the concept of &ldquo;fixation&rdquo; had given him the ultimate &ldquo;time stop&rdquo; ability. As long as he had this, it was as if he could never be defeated by any entity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Another example was Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Charity King Raguel&rsquo; which boasted the ultimate offensive capabilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The information from the &lsquo;Purity King Metatron&rsquo; that he had retrieved from Leon was also very useful in terms of energy efficiency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even the powers he had lent out to his subordinates were at Michael&rsquo;s disposal. He could manipulate them at will, as he had done with the &lsquo;Concealment&rsquo; power from Arios&rsquo; &lsquo;Punishment King Sandalphon.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For Michael, who had reached such a state of existence, there was no doubt that he could win any battle as long as he was present.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He had been defeated by the Hero Chloe, but that was only a &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; at less than 20 percent of his power. The current Michael was perfect, and his lost energy had been replenished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, there was a disparity of more than ten times between Michael and the Demon Lord Rimuru in front of him. He was assured that there was nothing to lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the first place, a serious Michael would have easily defeated Obera&rsquo;s army. Considering that, defeating Rimuru personally should have been a piece of cake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, it was not that simple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;This guy is a monster&rsquo;&mdash;Michael admitted from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Every attack he launched at Rimuru was unsuccessful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even the Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration, which he had unleashed with deadly intent, was instantly drowned out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael could not believe his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The moment he lost the overwhelming advantage of stopping time, he no longer had an effective means of attack against Rimuru. By the time he realized this, the battle had already been decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, all these attacks are so easy to understand. This is enough, I can handle&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just as he thought he was muttering something, Rimuru&rsquo;s threat level rose several notches.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The color of his eyes glowed gold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rimuru was no longer a reachable opponent for Michael.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he couldn&rsquo;t attack, then could he defend?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael&rsquo;s &lsquo;Castle Guard&rsquo; was no longer effective, but he still had the &lsquo;Patience King Gabriel&rsquo; from Velzard. Its essence was &lsquo;fixation&rsquo; and boasted absolute protection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that in mind, he activated the &lsquo;Snow Crystal&rsquo; to coagulate the moisture in the air. Pouring all his strength into it, he created an indestructible object that wrapped around Michael.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, this can be eaten too? Seriously?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For some reason, Rimuru himself was surprised as he made a hole in the &lsquo;Snow Crystal.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was an unbelievable reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You, what did you just do?! What did you say just now?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael couldn&rsquo;t help shouting&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rimuru replied matter-of-factly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I ate it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You ate it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yeah. That&rsquo;s my ability. Well, I didn&rsquo;t think I could eat the &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; either, but I guess it&rsquo;s possible if you try.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It couldn&rsquo;t be. Michael was astonished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;What the hell are you talking about?&rsquo; he felt like shouting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael acted on the basis of rational judgment. That was why he could not simply nod his head to such an irrational story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But the results were all that mattered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael was not so incompetent as to ignore the reality shown before him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, what should he do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All means of attack had been neutralized and his defenses were gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lsquo;You should run away,&rsquo; a calm voice whispered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the same time, something else suggested that he should search for information here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Either way, Michael had &lsquo;Parallel Existence,&rsquo; so even if he was defeated here, he could be revived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, since he had transferred his power to Feldway, it was possible to attack him even if it was reckless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Demon Lord Rimuru was too incomprehensible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And Michael&rsquo;s escape had already been blocked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&laquo;I have confined this area to the &lsquo;Imaginary Space.&rsquo; With this, it is now impossible for Michael to escape from this place.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He felt as if he heard an unidentified voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He thought it was absurd, but apparently it was true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If so, there was only one answer, so there was no need to worry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he couldn&rsquo;t defeat Demon Lord Rimuru here, then there would be no way out either way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, in that case, I&rsquo;ll respond. I&rsquo;ll show you how serious I really am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Michael declared, attempting to summon not the sword in his hand, but the most powerful sword ever created.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come, &lsquo;Deva.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But there was no response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rudra, the true owner of the sword, was already using it, so there was no way it would respond to Michael&rsquo;s call, who was only a fake master.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If he had been able to use &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; as Velgrynd did, he would have been able to understand the world as seen through Feldway&rsquo;s eyes.
