The infiltration was hard&mdash;much harder than anticipated but escaping from there was even more difficult. No ordinary man can get through that even with multiple lives&hellip; &ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I have faith in you. That, and you can&rsquo;t be killed anyways&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re still as cruel as ever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace begins fake crying, but the young man continues without displaying any emotions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what did you learn from investigating the Western Saints Church?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;About that&hellip; I really don&rsquo;t wanna say this but&hellip; I seriously can&rsquo;t find anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man remains impassive as he listens to Laplace&rsquo;s report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His reaction, or lack thereof, towards this report makes it feel almost as if he expected to hear it; he lets out a grin and replies:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oi&mdash;why are you doing this again, why can&rsquo;t you ever just be honest? You&rsquo;ve probably already discovered something by now, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace shrugs and sighs upon hearing the young man&rsquo;s reply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ya got me there. These pieces of information were all really difficult to obtain, and I was planning to sell them at a high price. Yet you&rsquo;ve seen through me like it was nothing. I&rsquo;ll accept this defeat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, it makes me happy to hear your praises like this. But still, don&rsquo;t expect a bonus, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Laplace sighs: &ldquo;What a mean character.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey now, don&rsquo;t say that. I did say I&rsquo;d give you the payment as agreed upon. Anyway, the consciousness of &ldquo;that thing&rdquo; has already been settled. I&rsquo;ve transferred the &lsquo;Demon Lord &lsquo;inside me into the body of a homunculus.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man smiles gleefully at this declaration. He then rings a bell and summons the secretary that seemed to have been waiting outside of the room. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you summon me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looks elegant and dignified&mdash;a model secretary through and through. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her beauty is decorated by pure, white skin which perfectly accentuates her braided blonde hair. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes are bright blue in color as if shining with mysterious lazurite.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, while the light in her eyes looks enthralling somehow, it does not seem to bear ill will. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Eh, could you be&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace becomes suspicious of the woman&rsquo;s appearance, yet in her eyes, Laplace finds a familiar presence. He then seems to recognize her true identity, and the realization quells his inner confusion. He bursts into laughter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why are ya dressing like this? Has your highness undergone a sex change? I&rsquo;d say it hardly suits you to dress like this. It&rsquo;s completely different from what you used to look like.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up. It took me ten years to obtain a body that I can move around freely in. These types of inconveniences are more than tolerable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The woman replies rudely, not willing to let Laplace berate her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her model secretary like behavior disappears as she intimately pats Laplace on the shoulder and lets out ruffian laughter without a care. Then she sits down on a chair. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, you let me meet this guy means I can put down the act now, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I hope you can still keep up the act at least on the outside. But since we&rsquo;re all familiar with each other here, it would be unnecessary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? I suppose I&rsquo;ll just do as the boss says then. But for what reason exactly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that, it&rsquo;s because currently you are still too weak, Kazaream. You&rsquo;ve yet to recover your full power, right? Until you&rsquo;ve regained your full strength as the &lsquo;Cursed Lord&rsquo;, you should just sit back and observe Clayman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kazaream, the woman who looks like a secretary, sighed with discontent at his reply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kazaream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is the name of an ancient demon lord. There once was a human named Leon who proclaimed himself a Demon Lord near the border of Kazaream&rsquo;s domain. Kazaream had then attempted to punish Leon for such bold declarations but was unsuccessful in the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this former Demon Lord Kazaream is the being that both Demon Lord Clayman and Laplace wish to revive, and who also happens to be the president of the Moderate Jester Troupes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet nowadays, Kazaream is no longer in possession of such power and thus assumes the body of a fragile woman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While near death, Kazaream was able to possess the flesh of this young man in a fateful encounter and thus cheated death. A few days earlier the former Demon Lord&rsquo;s Astral Body was finally successfully transferred to the physical body of this homunculus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, his power is much weaker than it was during the days of his prime. As a result, Kazaream decided to recognize the young man as his master and to serve as his subordinate. This was the agreement between Kazaream and the young man, which is why he made no objections.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having spent his time with the young man for ten years, Kazaream fully recognized him as his master.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. My power has yet to fully recover. I was defeated by that Demon Lord Leon so badly that I even lost my physical body. Sure my soul is able to settle in this homunculus, but this body is too fragile. If I am to fully release my magicules within it, it would completely destroy this body. That wouldn&rsquo;t be a revival at all&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so, now I see. So even the president is calling you boss. In that case, I too shall accept you as my boss. You are no longer just another client. I guess there&rsquo;s no reason to hide anything from you anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously? You are one stubborn idiot. We&rsquo;ve been collaborating for so long, and I even helped you revive your most precious president. Yet you still wouldn&rsquo;t believe me till now&hellip; &ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, that&rsquo;s a totally different matter. Speaking of which, the president taking on the appearance of a super model is absolutely hilarious!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Is that so? I don&rsquo;t really care about my appearance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No no no, the contrast between how ya look and how ya talk is just too much; it&rsquo;s absolutely hilarious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whatev&mdash;No, I understand now. If I must keep up this act, I need to talk more like a woman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No no no, that isn&rsquo;t the problem here, is it? Anyhow, it kinda suits ya better&hellip; But, how should I put this&hellip; WHAHAHAHA!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace bursts into laughter, unable to continue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh now, please shut your trap. It&rsquo;s not like I wanted to end up like this. This body is a Sorcerer&rsquo;s Dynasty Sarion&rsquo;s specially modified homunculus that boss has prepared just for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s quite expensive. If we didn&rsquo;t prepare the container devoid of a soul, it may have contaminated the transferred soul, resulting in a failed transfer. Speaking of which, if Kazaream hadn&rsquo;t escaped into my body, it might have already been mixed up with impurities and would have made it impossible to separate. In other words, I can&rsquo;t really help with how it looks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I really appreciate that, Boss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there was no joy in the voice of this young man and Kazaream expresses gratitude towards him. Even so, he still seems rather irritated and was only able to bring his good mood back after Laplace joined in expressing thanks. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll let it go this time. I get that you two must be experiencing a lot of feelings right now, reuniting after such a long time, but I want to talk business now. Let&#39;s hear the results of your investigations, Laplace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, Kazaream loses his smile and turns towards Laplace. Laplace also nods back, changing his attitude, and starts talking in a more serious manner:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Since you kept your part of this bargain and granted my wish, I would like to show you my sincerity as well. I&rsquo;ve infiltrated the Western Saints Church, wishing to discover its secrets. Yet I was unable to discover any deeper truths.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace says as he begins to describe his investigation in detail. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace&rsquo;s mission this time was to investigate the secrets hidden within the organization called the &lsquo;Western Saints Church&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This organization in particular is based in the Holy Empire Ruberios and claims to be an independent religious organization. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They portray themselves as &ldquo;The Just Protectors of The Weak&rdquo; and have significant influence over the western states. To the young man, this organization stands as an obstacle between him and his goals. This is why he hired Laplace, a member of the Moderate Jester Troupe jack of all trades, to help find any exploitable weaknesses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man believes that there&rsquo;s a hidden dark side to the Western Saints Church. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they are indeed agents of justice as they&rsquo;re meant to be, he will have to resort to damaging their reputation by any means possible. But that would be his last draw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now is not the time to strike yet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is because the Western Saints Church also happens to have the strongest of the Saints, the Commander of the Holy Imperial Guards, Hinata Sakaguchi.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Laplace isn&rsquo;t finished yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And then, since Hinata was absent, I got to infiltrate the church, but I didn&rsquo;t find anything suspicious. So I decided to go to the Holy City of Ruberios and check out the holy &lsquo;Inner Sanctum&rsquo; at the top of the Spirit Mountain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he becomes more and more excited with his explanation, Laplace begins to gesticulate with his hands and feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There, he witnessed something with his own eyes. A fearsome truth that he laid eyes upon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was really surprised, you know. The holy land was filled with a holy aura.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that only natural? It&rsquo;s a holy land after all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did ya hit your head or what? Have you become dumber since I last saw you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way, I definitely did not! By the way, president, your old tone is back again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Again with the same shi(t)&mdash;My business is irrelevant. Please proceed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Skeptical about the treatment he&rsquo;s receiving, Laplace continues to report everything he saw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After sneaking past the Western Saints Church headquarters, Laplace found himself before the Temple of Gods. This is the hall of the Pope, who acts as the Agent of God, but it is also the place where politics are managed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he entered the Temple of Gods, he started to feel something is amiss with the surroundings. He sensed a weak flow of magic that would affect one&rsquo;s psyche. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace possesses the unique skill &ldquo;Deceiver&rdquo; and because of its defense mechanism, he was able to detect the existence of such intricate magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">That&rsquo;s a surprise. I didn&rsquo;t anticipate there to be mental magic on par with my own here&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From there on, Laplace became more cautious and proceeded towards the Holy Church carefully. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace had some knowledge about the enemy organization. However, he had little to no idea about the connection between this Western Saints Church and the Holy Empire Ruberios.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Western Saints Church worships the monotheistic god Ruminas as their deity. It&rsquo;s the same case for Holy Empire Ruberios, and it can be said that both are disciples in the religion of Ruminism.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in terms of power, the Western Saints Church far outranks Ruberios.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason being Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reasons why the Western Saints Church have grown to become such an elite organization are all thanks to the achievements of Hinata Sakaguchi, who dispatched knights to branches of the church in western states, organized group efforts to protect the weak, and more. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Western Saints Church was once an organization that spread the teachings of their Goddess Ruminas under the protection of the Holy Empire Ruberios. Nowadays they&rsquo;ve suddenly become &ldquo;The Just Protector of The Weak&rdquo; and lost their ties as a serving organization under the Holy Empire Ruberios.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason of this transformation is the Holy Knight Order, which Hinata personally trained. They are the real issue. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are the strongest human knights&mdash; and the Holy Knight Order consists of many of these holy knights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Laplace considers them to be difficult to deal with. The Holy Knight Order does not follow the Holy Empire Ruberios but instead follows their one true Goddess, Ruminas&mdash;In other words, they follow Hinata&rsquo;s every command, as she herself is a disciple of Ruminas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the reason why the Western Saints Church was able to cut its ties with the Holy Empire Ruberios, thus becoming a force of its own. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there was another problem. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Holy Empire Ruberios&rsquo; military is not exclusively made up of the Holy Knight Order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is also the regular army of the Holy Empire Ruberios, namely the Imperial Guards which serve under the Pope&rsquo;s direct command. This regiment serving the Pope is another difficult organization to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They preach the saying &ldquo;in God&rsquo;s name, all men are born equal&rdquo;, which allowed them to garner a variety of talents to serve in the Order. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The conditions for joining are very straight forward: be a faithful follower of Ruminas and have combat capability above Level A.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The conditions seem simple on paper but are more difficult to achieve in practice, which is why the number of knights in the regiment is so small. However, they are all exceptional fighters or mages who are allowed to recruit their own subordinates. This is why the Imperial Guards are not a force to be trifled with. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even within such a powerful organization, Hinata is still said to be head and shoulders above everyone else as the top knight. Moreover, the archon (leader/highest ranking officer) of the Pope&rsquo;s ministry, Nicolas Spertus</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;is an admirer of Hinata. With all that in consideration, it can be said that half of the Western Saints Church is firmly under Hinata&rsquo;s control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The biggest player in both organizations around the Pope, Hinata, refuses to pledge herself to said Pope. Due to people such as Hinata, the relationship between the Western Saints Church and the Holy Empire of Ruberios appears severely twisted nowadays. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">What a difficult woman to deal with&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having summarized all that information, Laplace sighs with disdain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The holy church is filled with the power of spirits, calling forth the grand holy-element spirits. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such a strong aura of holiness greatly affected the Majin Laplace. His senses seemed to have become reduced, and he felt the desire to retreat as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace tried to encourage himself to move on while thinking over his next move. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He decided to head over to the top of the Spirit Mountain. It holds the &ldquo;Inner Sanctum&rdquo; which seems to be the place used for communicating with the Goddess. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While infiltrating the holy church, Laplace&rsquo;s instincts told him that there were some secrets hidden there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, what should I do next&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace considered what he should do for a moment and then headed towards the &ldquo;Inner sanctum&rdquo; across the holy church. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace had been concerned about the amount of time spent investigating, since Hinata would be returning at any moment. But since she wasn&rsquo;t there yet, he needed to seize the opportunity to have a sneak peek at the teachings of the Western Church&mdash;The identity of their deity. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">I&rsquo;ll just take a look.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He made up his mind and began to climb up the mountain roads.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, that was a mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, in terms of results it was the right decision as it provided incredibly valuable information, but at the same time, it put his life in jeopardy and gave him an unnecessary arduous task.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Using the narrow stone steps that led up the mountain, Laplace was able to reach the sanctum at its summit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sanctum was rather small compared to the Holy Church, yet the two were similar in terms of aesthetics. This small sanctum must have been the real residence of the God.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The surroundings were devoid of any sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The holy aura there was much more intense, and it pressed against Laplace&rsquo;s body and heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet there was a rather familiar magical aura he sensed in such a holy environment. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">&mdash;How could this be, Isn&rsquo;t this a holy land?! Why is there a presence of magicules? This is strange, it&rsquo;s really giving me the chills&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The biggest obstacle, Hinata, was indeed not there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if there were any other people around (though he would not take them lightly either way) they would not be dangerous enough to pose a threat&mdash;Laplace reached such a conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, was it really the right judgement?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With how things were developing, unease wormed its way into Laplace&rsquo;s heart as he doubted his decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">I&rsquo;m overthinking it. I could just go in with full stealth and run away against any overbearing opponents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace thought so to encourage himself and decided to give it a go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He carefully enabled his &ldquo;Deception Technique&rdquo; and was about to go sneaking into the sanctum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet in an instant&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He &ldquo;seems&rdquo; to have witnessed a light shining through his body. Immediately, the panicked Laplace made his rushed escape to the outside of the sanctum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Useless fool. A trash like you dares to profane the residence of &lsquo;God &lsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An incredibly powerful person emerged from the sanctum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under his dashing clothes, Laplace could vaguely see a strong, muscular body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The short, energetic blonde hair on his head displayed his temperament </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The style of a king. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two canine teeth that jutted out of his mouth were the most eye-catching.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How could this&hellip;A Vampire&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Silence, trash</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c1">. I shall punish you myself. You should feel honored to be killed by my hands!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What followed right after were strafes of red beams, all aimed at Laplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With nowhere to run and no plans of escape, Laplace was beaten to a pulp.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 669.56px; height: 952.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 669.56px; height: 952.50px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace shivers as he recounts his experience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That guy sure was strong. I really thought I would die there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Or rather&hellip; why haven&rsquo;t you died yet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man teases upon hearing Laplace&rsquo;s mumbling. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kazaream jests, astonished: &ldquo;Meh, you probably can&rsquo;t kill this guy even if you wanted to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really annoying; shouldn&rsquo;t ensuring an escape route and one&rsquo;s own safety be common sense? But I feel as though I&rsquo;ve been getting beat-downs all the time lately. So it&rsquo;s about time for me to act cool for once and show off what I am made of a little.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. But your role is to be a spy, so I&rsquo;d advise you to not try anything crazy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, Laplace. The goal is the important thing, playing cool is irrelevant, no?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sure, you are both right. I&rsquo;ll just allow them to beat me more. I may even become a masochist one day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why does that matter? It makes no difference if you lose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, just to live on and win at the last moment is enough. Speaking of which&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kazaream&rsquo;s expression becomes serious upon reaching this point in the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace also nods in response:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, yes, the more important issue is that he was able to beat the crap out of me, meaning that guy is definitely strong. The question here is, who really is this guy? Logically, the question is how could such a strong Majin appear in a holy place like that? That&rsquo;s definitely the breaking point. Could this revelation develop into an issue to shake the foundation of the Western Saints Church?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Majin&hellip; The Western Saints Church has connections with even Majin, and on top of that, a high-ranking Vampire&hellip; &ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace, as if in sync with the other&rsquo;s thoughts, pushes towards the core issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man nods in agreement. However, he is unable to hide the shock on his face at such an unexpected turn of events.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now this may be an issue. The man who beat Laplace, according to my available knowledge, can&rsquo;t be just a simple Majin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. I agree.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, how so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man responds dubiously, despite what Kazaream and Laplace believe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to brag here, but I am strong. For instance, against that Dryad back then, had I fought her earnestly, she wouldn&rsquo;t have stood a chance. I just thought it was disadvantageous to fight in the forest, plus it would get real annoying real fast if she called for backup. That&rsquo;s why I decided to run. There wasn&rsquo;t really any point in fighting her. However, that guy was different. His strength could rival a demon lord. That&rsquo;s why running away was my only option.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the forest, the Dryads are particularly powerful. Due to their racial attributes, they can teleport to anywhere within the forest instantaneously through the touch of any vegetation within their domain. Not only that, they are able to &ldquo;share&rdquo; all their information among members of their own race. That&rsquo;s why under such circumstances, their companions would surely come to her aid. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dryads are a difficult race to deal with, and it&rsquo;s for this Laplace had decided to flee. If it were only one Dryad, Laplace would be confident in his victory. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it&rsquo;s different this time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That guy was a monster. Definitely stronger than me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace asserts with confidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The air in the room suddenly grows heavier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, a Demon Lord&hellip; Kazaream, what do you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kazaream sighs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As I said&mdash;we may be in trouble. To my knowledge, there&rsquo;s only one person that fits the description.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh&#65311; And who would that be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man asks upon seeing that Kazaream is beating around the bush.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Demon Lord Valentine. One of the ancient Demon Lords whose strength rivaled mine when I was in my prime.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, no wonder. If he can fight the president on even footing, fleeing was definitely the right call. I&rsquo;m glad I followed my instincts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace shrugs as he responds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He went through all the trouble of infiltrating the Church when Hinata was away yet encountering a Demon Lord?&mdash;His expression tells the whole story. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Hmm&mdash;The Demon Lord resides within the Western Saints Church. Could it be&mdash;that the Pope is in fact Demon Lord Valentine?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who knows? It&rsquo;s strange that a Demon Lord would seek help from the humans. President, what is this Valentine guy like?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon receiving the attention of both the young man and Laplace, Kazaream begins to recall the past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He begins to knock his temple elegantly with his slim fingers, closing his eyes as he looks back on a series of events in the past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Despite how I look right now, I&rsquo;ve survived three of the great wars that have plagued the lands every five hundred years. This certified me as one of the ancient Demon Lords. However, when I formally became a Demon Lord, there were already six others&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Starting with that, Kazaream begins to tell the story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demon Lord Valentine himself has far more experience as a Demon Lord compared to Kazaream. With immense amounts of power, the title of King of the Undead Vampires is not a title just for show. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Demon Lord Valentine, who himself is the symbol of the undead, has always alarmed Kazaream who had evolved from the long-living elven race to the undead race.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;ve fought against Valentine several times. But never did it amount to anything. When beings like us start fighting, even if we ourselves remain unharmed, our surroundings sustain heavy damages. That&rsquo;s why we began sitting down and talking things over&mdash;this later developed into a system which decides on issues based on majority of votes&mdash;the Walpurgis Banquet. And the reason why any decision would be passed with three votes is a tradition inherited from the time where there were only seven demon lords.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or perhaps it&rsquo;s because everyone was too lazy to change it&mdash;Kazaream laughs elegantly. Kazaream&#39;s voice fluctuates between masculine and feminine, and while it is creepy, the owner of said voice doesn&#39;t seem to notice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kazaream&rsquo;s smile gives way to a stern look as the story continues:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say, as someone who has fought against Valentine, he only ever sees humans and demi-humans as tools. There is absolutely no way that man would go and become a guardian of humanity. &ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace nods in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man also begins to mull over Kazaream&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, then should we make a deal with him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on Laplace. Remember, a deal is something that all parties involved have to agree to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Knowing that he is not equal to the other party, Laplace immediately banishes that thought. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In addition, someone as stubborn as Hinata would never collaborate with a Demon Lord. Which means the Vampire Laplace encountered must have just been some insignificant Majin instead of the real Demon Lord, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man claims, seemingly in agreement with Laplace. However, Kazaream disagrees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure that was Valentine. I&rsquo;ve heard of the swaths of red beams attack before, and there&rsquo;s no mistaking it. Valentine&#39;s title was &lsquo;Overlord of Fresh Blood&rsquo;, and he&rsquo;s specialized in the ability &lsquo;Blood Flash Shockwave,&rsquo; which turns blood into beams of magical particles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is said that the &ldquo;Blood Flash Shockwave&rdquo; is a diffusing particle beam. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It turns one&rsquo;s blood into magical particles and thrusts it out as a violent barrage&mdash;The only person who has the magicule reserves to pull this off is, without a doubt, Demon Lord Valentine, concludes Kazaream. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words, the Vampire who Laplace fought is most definitely Demon Lord Valentine. However, he would never collaborate with humans. If that&rsquo;s true, the only conclusion we can draw is that the Pope must be Demon Lord Valentine, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible&hellip; and the most logical conclusion to make. But it&rsquo;s still confusing as to how he&rsquo;s able to keep Hinata in the dark about all this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing the other two hum in agreement, Kazaream also expresses his own agreement. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, that would be the most reasonable explanation. Although I still have my doubts, there are things that just don&rsquo;t add up&hellip; But right now our focus should be the location that Valentine resides, where only the Pope could enter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He says as he lists out the facts obtained so far.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let me confirm this again, he is a real Demon Lord, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Most likely. His appearance is rather identical to my recollection. On top of that, Demon Lord Valentine&rsquo;s pride would never allow him to work for anyone but himself&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, there aren&#39;t many Majin who are stronger than I am. If that kind of monster exists in that place, any investigations in the future may very well be in jeopardy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Kazaream and Laplace hold the same view, the young man also begins to accept the hypothesis that the Pope could very well be Demon Lord Valentine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyhow, this information is highly valuable. You&rsquo;ve outdone yourself this time, Laplace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man is definitely elated to have obtained such a trump card to bring down the Western Saints Church. He shows no sign of concern despite learning that the enemy is backed by a powerful demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Based on the newly obtained information, the young man now begins to plan out his next move. As such, he enjoys the scheming of the coming events&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My report ends there. By the way, how are things progressing on Clayman&rsquo;s side?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace asks as he suddenly recalls that upon finishing his report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man shows an annoyed expression of displeasure at the question. He brushes up his shining dark hair and replies with a complaining tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well about that&hellip; he messed up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did he fail?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. It was all smooth sailing until we had Hinata duel that slime you mentioned. However, things somehow didn&rsquo;t go according to plan afterwards&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man says as he begins to briefly explain the turn of events.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the start, Clayman was successful in bringing Demon Lord Milim to his side thanks to the secret jewelry the young man gifted him&mdash;all thanks to the dominating orb&rsquo;s magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to examine its effectiveness, he&rsquo;d have to confirm the extent of influence the orb had on Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And so we decided to have Milim fight an appropriately powerful individual to test out her strength. Demon Lords are all cunning and unfathomably powerful beings, so we decided to use the least intelligent-looking Karion as the test subject.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kazaream also joins the explanation after the young man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And to top it off, the capital of Yuurazania could be taken down in the process. There are many ex-human slaves that reside there, and their souls could be used to awaken Clayman as a true Demon Lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As they say so, the young man and Kazaream looks at each other and sigh simultaneously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To use them for Clayman&rsquo;s awakening&hellip;talk about killing two birds with one stone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But then Milim went out of control and decided to give a war declaration by herself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, Karion and his men got an extra week to prepare themselves, which allowed the people residing within the capital to seek refuge elsewhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As expected, manipulating Demon Lords with magic items is no simple task. We need to make sure to give more detailed commands next time before we try anything else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You gotta have a bit of faith in me. I&rsquo;m exceptionally good with mind manipulation magic, you know! My title &lsquo;Cursed King&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t just for show. I made that domination orb myself; it is an incredible piece of magical equipment. The only reason our plan got messed up is because of that incompetent bastard Clayman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all water under the bridge at this point now. Anyway, the soul collection plan at Beast Kingdom failed so we set our sights on the Farmus Kingdom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Farmus Kingdom?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, that country where they performed the summoning rituals in-house and gathered a number of Otherworlders. And because of that, I thought it was about time to reduce their influence a bit. I secretly found someone to leak some information regarding the Monster Kingdom and caught the interest of that greedy king and his subordinates.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And given how greedy they are, they took the bait really hard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The original plan of creating a new Demon Lord out of the Orc Lord failed spectacularly, so based on Laplace&rsquo;s report they decided on another plan&mdash;Instigate the Farmus Kingdom to invade the Jura-Tempest Federation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That Kingdom has several high level Majin and we get to have them kill each other against those Otherworlders from Farmus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It just so perfectly happens that Rimuru, the leader of that nation, was acting alone outside his country when Clayman&rsquo;s subordinate infiltrated it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru was the ideal bait to draw Hinata out for a fight; the plan is truly killing two birds with one stone. However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But to our surprise, that slime named Rimuru was able to escape from Hinata! This is one slime that we absolutely cannot afford to overlook, just like you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rather sharp jab&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s even worse things to come&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In my opinion, Farmus&rsquo;s victory was all but guaranteed. However, once the leader of the monsters gets involved, the situation may very well be turned. But honestly, it makes little difference as to who wins. We would just have to negotiate with the side that wins. The real objective is to cause enough casualties&mdash;and gather souls. And I had thought we&rsquo;d use those souls to help awaken our cute little Clayman, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a complete failure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The grand army of Farmus was completely decimated by a single slime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Unbelievable right, but it&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time for me to have my plans derailed like this, even with my unique skill &ldquo;Planner&rdquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man is very disappointed and Kazaream looks quite upset about it as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-hold on! Taken out by a single monster, how is that even possible? Did Farmus really underestimate the Monster Kingdom that much!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace shouts in surprise upon hearing such preposterous claims, to which Kazaream made the following response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As I mentioned, the Farmus Kingdom was rather interested. It prepared a huge army of twenty-thousand soldiers consisting of knights and mages. Yet the entire legion was eliminated. As I said, there were no survivors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehhhh! That&rsquo;s just madness&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace was completely baffled to discover this series of bizarre events. However, more surprising new information awaits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, according to Clayman&rsquo;s post-war reconnaissance of the battlefield, he claims that all the corpses have disappeared. It means that someone has used those corpses as a sacrifice to summon, or create some sort of monster&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I could use all those corpses to create a magic golem, god knows how powerful of a monster could be created? On top of that, those aren&rsquo;t your run of the mill normal corpses; they&rsquo;re all highly trained soldiers. The negative emotions on the battlefield have also created the perfect environment for casting this type of magic. With all of these conditions combined, one can expect to summon monsters that can at least rival a Demon Lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it even possible? The way I see it, it&rsquo;s our loss that we couldn&rsquo;t retrieve the souls. According to Clayman, he couldn&rsquo;t even acquire a single soul at the scene, so his awakening plan is once again in shambles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Says the young man as he lets out a sigh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man laments his losses and reflects that the reason for all of this failure was because he has been operating on too many fronts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Over-emphasizing efficiency and neglecting each individual strategy, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve been failing at every step along the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps I am being too greedy&mdash;thought the young man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Could it be that the slime named Rimuru was the one that harvested all those souls?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What nonsense are you suggesting, Laplace? That&rsquo;s a feat beyond even a Demon Lord, so how could a single Majin manage that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kazaream is right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The collection of 20000 souls as well controlling them would be a difficult task even for someone skilled in the art of magic. If one is to proceed without considering their own limitations, it will no doubt result in losing control of the souls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, if someone did pull that off successfully&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, yeah right, Laplace. If this guy takes twenty-thousand souls in one sitting then he&rsquo;s probably evolved into a monster by now, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man smirks at the possibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re correct. I might be overthinking this a bit too much, having so many bad thoughts running around in my head.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace&rsquo;s doubts are ridiculed by the other two believing it to be an unfathomable idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The conditions necessary to awaken as a True Demon Lord&mdash;That&rsquo;s something even Kazaream doesn&rsquo;t know in its entirety. If anything, it would probably require an insane number of souls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to confirm such a hypothesis, they&rsquo;d decided to use Clayman as a lab rat. Clayman also attempted to experiment using the Orc Lord. However, all of these plans have since, to their annoyance, failed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under such circumstances, even someone as calculated as Kazaream could not have expected a slime of all things to out of nowhere evolve into a &ldquo;True Demon Lord&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Laplace&rsquo;s guess has been right all along, it&rsquo;s just that the three have yet to discover it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speaking of which, what&rsquo;s Clayman been up to lately &hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having infiltrated the Western Church and almost dying in the process, Laplace thought that Clayman would probably understand his hardship. His eyes drift off as he asked dubiously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s currently on standby. As it stands right now, it&rsquo;s better to be acting cautiously. But thanks to Milim doing what she said she would, the Beast Kingdom has now been turned to dust. For now, we&rsquo;ll slow down our pace and reassess our future strategies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? So not all of our plans have ended in complete failure?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi oi, are you mocking me, Laplace? Even with most of my power lost, strategizing is still my specialty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ll be really angry if all my plans just went awry like this! Despite the many setbacks to our plans, we are, at least, still successful in weakening the Farmus Kingdom. Consequently, the Western Nations will be more unified from now on, making it easier for us to control.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And the Jura Forest can act as a defense against invasions from the Eastern Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. So president, if we are going to negotiate with the winning forces, then there&rsquo;s no need to destroy the Monster Kingdom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace fully agrees with the two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Plans that change according to the circumstances to ensure that they are always profitable&mdash;These are the abilities possessed by Kazaream&rsquo;s unique skill &ldquo;Planner&rdquo;. Laplace recalls this and praises it in heart &ldquo;He sure has his way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milim defeated Karion, which proves the domination orb is indeed effective. Our display of power should stop here, and we should wait to see how the other Demon Lords react.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve ordered Clayman to be on standby. The Eastern Empire is going to take action anyways, so there will be more chances for him to collect souls.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Additionally, the Western Saints Church is also onto the Monster Kingdom, so keeping that country around should make things more convenient for us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s why you two are saying there&rsquo;s no need to rush&hellip; Laplace realizes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Which means, our enemy at the moment is just the Western Saints Church?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That would be it for the time being.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, things aren&rsquo;t as simple as that. We must assume the enemy forces consist of both saints and Demon Lords, so it would be too dangerous to act without exercising caution.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They don&rsquo;t want to have a direct confrontation with the Church as they want to avoid disputes with the various other forces. Laplace asks if that is the current plan, to which the young man nods in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Monster Kingdom will no doubt become an obstacle after they seize control of the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from that, there is another reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They must reflect and take to heart the reasons of their continued failure. Next time, they must carefully assess their enemies and avoid taking a double-front approach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Western Saints Church and the Holy Empire Ruberios behind it. These are the high priority enemies that they need to strike down first. This time, they need to be cautious and avoid leaving traces&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is why it&rsquo;s rather convenient to have the Monster Kingdom around for the time being. By exploiting the Western Saints Church&rsquo;s doctrines, they can have the attention of people such as Hinata since she will focus on the monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Church definitely won&rsquo;t ignore a Majin like Rimuru. After the defeat of the Farmus Kingdom, it&rsquo;s unlikely that they could convince the rest of the Western Nations to wage a holy crusade. But in order to avoid the loss of faith, they will definitely need to make a move.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. If we are able to intervene somehow and instigate the two parties, they may kill each other off. We just need to wait for both sides&rsquo; strength to decline.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Says the young man with an evil grin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That Majin alone annihilated 20,000 trained soldiers by himself. No one could deal with him except for Hinata. The young man must have concocted many plans waiting for this moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The arrangement of plans seems to be done. There is not a single sound of hesitation in the young man&rsquo;s voice as he explains them to Laplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But the things you reported are beyond our planning, Laplace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I can&rsquo;t believe that the Demon Lord Valentine came to mess things up. Could they actually be collaborating? Knowing Hinata&rsquo;s personality, she would never collaborate with a Demon Lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both the young man and Kazaream note with a hint of anger. The tone itself is almost like saying that it would be much easier to deal with the Western Church if Demon Lord Valentine were never involved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s my fault.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Laplace feels rather embarrassed as he tries to find an excuse for himself:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know. How about we draw out the Demon Lord to remove him from obstructing our investigation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? What do you mean, Laplace?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Think about it, we only need to mention it to Clayman and tell him to convene the Banquet. Right now the Demon Lord Frey is on his side and so is Milim. Three Demon Lords should be enough to initiate a meeting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Walpurgis Banquet&mdash;As long as the meeting is being held, all the Demon Lords will be drawn to show up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I see. In this way we&rsquo;ll be able to draw Demon Lord Valentine out of Ruberios.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young man nodded with a smile, having accepted Laplace&rsquo;s proposal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s rather rare for Laplace to act smart for once. Trying to find an opportunity to lure Hinata out of the holy lands again so your investigation can proceed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?! Why me again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only natural.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">Come on, seriously?</span><span class="c1">&mdash;Laplace thinks to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But neither the young man nor Kazaream seem to care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, without Laplace&rsquo;s consensus, the Majins begin to draft a new plan.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="id.tyjcwt"></a><h2 class="c15" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c6 c2">Chapter 1</span></h2><p class="c19"><span class="c2 c7">Meeting of Man and Monster</span></p><hr><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman didn&rsquo;t overestimate his power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had taken over all the land owned by Demon Lord Kazaream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the defeat of Kazaream at the hands of Demon Lord Leon, all of Kazaream&rsquo;s previous subordinates went to submit themselves to Clayman&rsquo;s reign.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman took over Kazaream&rsquo;s domain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other Demon Lords did not object to it and the merging process afterwards proceeded smoothly. Everything was unfolding according to Demon Lord Kazaream&rsquo;s precautionary plan which he devised for times like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman gradually expanded his territory and became a force to be reckoned with as a new Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Among all the Demon Lords, Clayman holds the greatest amount of wealth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be more specific, Clayman is the only one who knows how to exploit financial situations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s been secretly trading with the Eastern Empire and has established a healthy trade relationship with Dwargon. Through these trading channels, he was able to import the latest models of weapons and armor from the major players in both the east and the west.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is able to use his predecessor&rsquo;s legacy and magic to improve the combat capabilities of his subordinates, as well as recruit Majins who crave power. Clayman excels at luring Majins by using great wealth and then manipulating them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only that, but he&rsquo;s been scheming behind the scenes with all the profits gained through his relentless spending. This helped Clayman form a web of connections between different countries while simultaneously keeping them all in the dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything was going according to Clayman&rsquo;s plans, and he had all the information he needed to maintain the control. Thus, his plan of world domination was already halfway complete&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All he lacks now is power, and Clayman is very aware of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victory in a war is determined by the number of combatants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman holds such a view, and for that reason, he never puts himself on a pedestal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He knows all too well that no matter how much power one can accumulate before a war, there&rsquo;s still a possibility that one could suffer a complete defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He thought that Kazaream underestimated his opponent too much. And thus the defeat of that Demon Lord raised a giant red flag.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why Clayman stood firmly in the center of all major powers and cautiously planned his expansion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nowadays, Clayman has finally gained a trump card in terms of strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demon Lord Milim&mdash;Her ferocious techniques are second to none, and she is able to surpass many of her peers within the Ten Great Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She went to destroy an entire country on her own without a single care, even though Demon Lord Karion is more powerful than Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is very delighted now that he has obtained the strength he always lacked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wishes full-heartedly to eliminate Demon Lord Leon and believes that he would have his wish granted soon enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But before that could happen&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Hehehe, &rdquo;That Lord&rdquo; is truly something. He reached the same conclusion as I did. To have the annoying Saints&rsquo; Church fend off the Majin Rimuru. This is the most efficient way to reduce the strength of both parties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He won&rsquo;t have to worry once the enemies begin to kill each other&mdash;This was Clayman&rsquo;s plot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">In order to execute the mission of investigating the hidden truths within the Western Saints Church, and to confirm their ties with Demon Lord Valentine&hellip; All I need to do is to coordinate with Laplace to give him an opening to sneak in once more during the Walpurgis Banquet, when their defense would definitely be slacking. What a perfect plan!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman sips his wine with great joy, savoring the taste.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The taste of the hundred-year wine is definitely worthy of someone of his stature. It&rsquo;s as if he&rsquo;s tasting the amount of work and hardship put into the wine to make it that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has been strictly maintained as the classiest merchandise, kept in great care until the day someone opens and tastes it&mdash;It has been cared for that much, just for Clayman alone to drink it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is only natural to Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is a really graceful king. Thus, only the top-quality goods are worthy of him. Clayman has no doubt about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, what should be the subject of discussion for the Walpurgis banquet&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman thinks as he continues to taste the wine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The time would be set for the evening one week from now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be the day of a new moon, when vampires have the least amount of power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just to be extra cautious, he has particularly chosen the day when Demon Lord Valentine has the least strength. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question now is, under what name should he summon the demon lords?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman squints and tilts his head up, whispering:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I should take the chance and attack. Now would be a good time to take all of Karion&rsquo;s territory.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But Clayman, didn&rsquo;t boss tell ya to stay put?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, the echoing sound questioning him fills up the empty room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Clayman didn&rsquo;t seem to panic at all, he merely puts on a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you are here, Laplace? You are as cunning as always.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way you didn&rsquo;t realize that. Have ya been thinking too hard lately?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hohoho, that can&rsquo;t be helped. I&rsquo;ve had two chances to awaken, yet I&rsquo;ve missed them both due to my miscalculations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so harsh on yourself. The president has already made a prediction that the Eastern Empire would make a move soon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Perhaps. But Laplace, I&rsquo;ve come up with a good idea. Now that their capital is destroyed, there are many weak races remaining around the territory of the Beast Kingdom. I want to take over Karion&rsquo;s land before any other demon lords gather all the survivors, and then kill them. This way, I&rsquo;ll get to awaken at long last. So, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree that this is a great plan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite how Clayman phrased that, Laplace doesn&rsquo;t think highly of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That sounds rather inappropriate; isn&rsquo;t it a bit too cruel? Wouldn&rsquo;t you be overdoing it if you just kill all those weaklings without even knowing the conditions of awakening?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman isn&rsquo;t pleased with Laplace&rsquo;s disagreement and directs a stern glare towards him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Laplace, that doesn&rsquo;t sound like you at all. Are you sympathizing with them? We follow the rule of survival of the fittest, so aren&rsquo;t they lucky that they would die for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But you remember that time you killed thousands of human slaves and it did not change a thing, right? What did that amount to? You can&rsquo;t turn back time once you&rsquo;ve done it, so you&rsquo;d better think things over now and act cautiously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace is right. Clayman once bought and massacred thousands of slaves, yet he failed to evolve into a &ldquo;True Demon Lord&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Clayman is still not convinced even with Laplace pointing out the flaws.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are overthinking it, Laplace. I do whatever I please with my bought goods. If killing a thousand won&rsquo;t do, I&rsquo;ll just have to kill ten thousand. Since I already know it is necessary to have human souls for the awakening, there is no need to show mercy to the weak!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman expresses his arrogant point of view. And, attempting to sway Laplace&rsquo;s opinion, he continued:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Besides, this type of mission is also beneficial for &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo;. &lsquo;A new force has risen in the Great Forest of Jura. In addition, the Lord there dares to proclaim himself a Demon Lord.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve decided to use that as a reason to invoke the Walpurgis Banquet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, that should work as an excuse. But this proposal doesn&rsquo;t constitute any reason to invade the Beast Kingdom still, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, Laplace. &lsquo;During my investigation, my subordinate Myuran was murdered by that guy. That&rsquo;s how we discovered that Demon Lord Karion has betrayed us&rsquo;&mdash;That&rsquo;s the testimony I&rsquo;d like to give. I&rsquo;ve lost my subordinate, and in the process of collecting evidence I take over Karion&rsquo;s territory. That would be my justification and I bet no one will complain about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace begins to assess Clayman&rsquo;s claim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim&rsquo;s domain is bordering the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania, so no one would jump out and bring out any evidence against them. The fact that Milim has beaten Karion would be the best justification for Clayman to back up his action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from that, Clayman also demanded Milim to assist him in the investigation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time he marches his army through Milim&rsquo;s territory to the Beast Kingdom, neither side will object.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With all of these, the fabrication of evidence would not be an issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The plan is almost perfect, yet Laplace still thinks Clayman shouldn&rsquo;t take action just yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">Aren&rsquo;t you rushing too much, Clayman?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he thinks so, it would be difficult to change Clayman&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly however, Laplace realizes in shock that he has ignored something important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, it would make sense if you do all these&hellip; wait, hold on a sec! Myuran was killed?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He asks in panic. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace still believes Myuran was a reliable Majin even though he knows Clayman has never treated her well. Among Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates, she&rsquo;s also an important lieutenant among the ranks of the &ldquo;Five Fingers&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That Majin isn&rsquo;t great at fighting, but she&rsquo;s a conjurer who thinks and acts fast. She acts as a perfect support role in her line of work. Apart from that, she always looked as if she&rsquo;s unwilling to do her job, which is why Laplace and the others often talk to her in order to encourage her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most important part is that she has a normal set of values despite serving someone like Clayman. Simply for that reason alone, Laplace commemorates her highly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Clayman&rsquo;s expression remains unchanged as he answers Laplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know what you are lamenting over, but Myuran has been killed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really? I can&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s dead. Are you sure about your source?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? I inserted &lsquo;Dominating Heart&rsquo; inside her and that thing is long gone by now. The live heart I kept with me has turned into dust, so I&rsquo;m sure about it. She did just happen to complete her mission before she died, so it was good timing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on now Clayman. You just lost such a capable subordinate. At least try to mourn her for a second, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace is rather sad seeing Clayman&rsquo;s cold reaction and decided to try and persuade him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">This guy wasn&rsquo;t so terrible before. His personality seems to have been twisted ever since he became a demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only Clayman&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of Laplace&rsquo;s companions within the Moderate Clown Troupe began to develop twisted personalities. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace is the same, so he can&rsquo;t really lecture Clayman about it. Although Laplace is aware of that, he still believes that Clayman has changed a lot compared to before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, you are such a nice person Laplace. Tear once told me as well that you should cherish your tools. Didn&rsquo;t you teach her that, Laplace? That&rsquo;s precisely the issue. My tool is broken, so I must punish the one who broke it. Wouldn&rsquo;t that comfort the spirit of my tool in heaven?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace decides to give up on the issue after seeing Clayman&rsquo;s evil smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;you&rsquo;re right. At least don&rsquo;t let her die in vain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right? I know you would do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman grins after saying that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">That&rsquo;s not what I meant&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace has rather mixed feelings seeing that laughing face, but he decides to change his mood and instead examine the potential flaws Clayman&rsquo;s plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, Clayman, about the Walpurgis Banquet, would anyone object to the meeting?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace expresses his doubts, while Clayman&rsquo;s smile also fades away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible that there will likely be voices of objection. But right now, I can manipulate Milim however I wish. I&rsquo;ll send her to play with whoever dares to object.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman&rsquo;s expression twists with confidence and greed as he says so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Laplace pales.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoa hold on a sec, that idea is way too dangerous! That guy also mentioned that Milim may act out of control anytime. Even though the president made that magical orb himself, you should not be so careless, shouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Laplace. Milim is already following my every order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of it, but didn&rsquo;t she act on her own and declare a war by herself? Manipulating the ancient Demon Lords is not an easy feat; their resistance against mental control is probably very strong. It will be suicidal if you are going to completely rely on Demon Lord Milim!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace tries his hardest to give Clayman some advice, but his words fall on deaf ears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you jealous now that Milim is in my palm, Laplace?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not at all! But you should save your trump card for the end game, no?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up. I don&rsquo;t need you to worry for me. &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo; wishes to awaken me to become a true demon lord. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll destroy the Beast Kingdom. I&rsquo;ll take care of anyone who dares to stop me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a second! Didn&rsquo;t that guy order the president already to have you stay put? You just need to figure out how to make it through the Banquet now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace again tries his hardest to convince Clayman, yet all of Laplace&#39;s words blew through his mind like the wind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Trust me, Laplace. If I only follow Kazaream-sama&rsquo;s plan, I won&rsquo;t complete &ldquo;that Lord&#39;s&rdquo; wishes. Now is the time to strike.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman declares his final stance and ends the discussion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, Laplace couldn&rsquo;t stop Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman&rsquo;s views do hold some truth, and they don&rsquo;t deviate much from the orders from above. However, Laplace still finds something wrong with Clayman&rsquo;s plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So he proceeds with:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, Clayman. I&rsquo;ll ask you one more question. About this operation, were you really the one that decided on it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean by that, Laplace? The only ones that can give me orders are Kazaream-sama and &ldquo;that Lord&rdquo;. You should know that better than anyone, shouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Clayman reassures there is no problem, Laplace won&rsquo;t intervene any further.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, he still has a lot of work to do on his own, such as the second attempt at infiltrating the Western Saints Church.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fine, that will do. I&rsquo;m leaving. But be careful Clayman! Don&rsquo;t act all reckless without thinking, and you&rsquo;d better not get careless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After giving that advice, Laplace parts ways with Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Clayman&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Did he think I was under anyone&rsquo;s influence? What a stupid thought. No, could it be&hellip; that I&rsquo;ve seized control over Milim&rsquo;s power, and he&rsquo;s afraid that I would take his reward? But being jealous isn&rsquo;t really Laplace&rsquo;s thing&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman hasn&rsquo;t been over-confident with his ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, he&rsquo;s gained another thing to boost his ego having controlled Demon Lord Milim. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why he said those words to his most trusted friend, Laplace. That&rsquo;s also why Clayman thought Laplace was jealous of himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While feeling somewhat disappointed towards his friend, Clayman took another sip of his red wine. It tastes bitter and lacks the crisp sweetness from just before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">&mdash;Annoying!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He suddenly hurled the glass in his hand towards the wall. Due to a feeling he himself can&rsquo;t describe; he just wishes to vent his anger using whatever objects that happen to be near him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The classy wine bottle that was placed on the table is shattered into pieces now. Even so, Clayman doesn&rsquo;t really mind. He decides to take something out of his pocket in order to calm himself down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A piece of a mask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A mask with a smiling face engraved on it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Laplace. I&rsquo;ll awaken successfully. Then, I will dominate this world. No, Laplace. I won&rsquo;t lose anything else! This time, we will be together. We will live our life together&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;In the solitude of an empty room, Clayman mumbles his deepest desires buried within his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He gently caresses the mask as if it were a priceless treasure&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We need to defeat Demon Lord Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That objective is now settled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That bastard is still hiding somewhere in the dark We&rsquo;ve got to take care of him sooner or later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I am to become a Demon Lord, it would be unavoidable to involve other Demon Lords in that process. With that being the case, Clayman would be the best candidate for my flesh sacrifice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now I&rsquo;ve got no idea why Milim provoked Karion, and there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a way to persuade her. I guess I&rsquo;ll brag about my power in order to avoid future grievances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, Clayman has crossed the line this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Karma will bite back&mdash;</span><span class="c13 c2">I&rsquo;ll make him pay for his evil deeds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">About our future plans:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Youmu has gained massive popularity in the Kingdom of Farmus with the title of the champion. I&rsquo;ve decided to exploit that and release our captive, the Farmus King, to engage in post-war negotiations. This would facilitate us in gaining control of Farmus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We also need to respond to the Western Saints Church and declare our nation&rsquo;s stance to every country we&rsquo;ve encountered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would be a lot of business to discuss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;ll likely be a rather busy meeting after this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But let&rsquo;s hear Souei&rsquo;s report first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like Clayman has been on the move lately, so I need to listen to it in detail again and hold a post-war conference. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve brought my subordinates from the Tempest Federation alongside the three Beastketeers to the big conference room. However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My &ldquo;Universal Perception &ldquo;has detected a party of around fifty people approaching our town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm&hellip; That would probably be the head of the Blumund branch of the Freedom Association, Fuze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It didn&rsquo;t take long before the guards escorted him here. He was quite dramatic in trying to break through the soldiers&rsquo; defense line to talk to me about something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Long time no see, Rimuru-san. I&rsquo;m glad I made it in time. According to the security pacts between the Kingdom of Blumund and the Tempest Federation, I&rsquo;ve come to your aid. I was terrified that we would arrive too late.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze smiles as he finishes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, he seems rather nervous, and the soldiers following him seem to be nervous as well. Everyone&rsquo;s eyes glinted with a resolve of self-sacrifice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I can tell that they&rsquo;re prepared for war seeing how they all are armed to the teeth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? The head of the Freedom Association branch comes to meet me himself, what do you guys plan to d&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haha, now now. I&rsquo;ve left the duties to Higis. And about the merchants&mdash;especially Myourmiles &mdash; have informed me about the situation in the town. I heard you guys have been fighting against the Kingdom of Farmus so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Hmm? Hmmhmmhmm?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that I think about it, it&rsquo;s been ten days since I sent back the guests from Blumund.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So did the head of the Branch hear the report and decide to come assist us in battle?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case I appreciate it, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Even if it&rsquo;s too late to start deploying the defense line, we should deploy soldiers around the town to fortify our defenses. It seems that the main force of the Farmus Military has yet to arrive. We also have no idea when the advanced forces will arrive. After all, we&rsquo;ve long exceeded the deadline they declared&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze tries his hardest to explain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, with what I suspect is the firm look of someone that is ready to embrace death, he finishes his words in one go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s no suspicion anymore. He really has made up his mind. And he mentioned that he has left all his duties to Higis. It seems that he truly wishes to defend this town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, about that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">The war is already over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Fuze&rsquo;s expressing his views all enthusiastically, I couldn&rsquo;t really drop the bomb on his face right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you intend to breach through their frontline? That would be hard though. According to our intel, the enemy has roughly twenty thousand soldiers. You definitely can&rsquo;t win by going head to head with them. However, I contacted some of my old friends and arranged to have three hundred adventurers on hold. These men may be small in number, but we will fight with everything we&rsquo;ve got. We&rsquo;ve prepared to fight a protracted war and will even conduct guerrilla warfare using the forest&rsquo;s landscape&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is it really alright to come and assist us like this? That would be unnecessary to ask considering how much Fuze indeed cares for us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;and being able to fight alongside the beastmen has really reassured me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze continues to throw out his art of war by himself. Now I am in a difficult spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of my subordinates wear expressions of shock whereas the Beastketeers have no idea how to respond.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That can&rsquo;t be helped though, since everyone here knows the war is over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mean, I honestly didn&rsquo;t think he would come to our aid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though we&rsquo;ve made a pact that aimed to avoid military aid, he still came as fast as he could with as many soldiers he could gather.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That does please me a little bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so, we&rsquo;ll put that aside for now&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;This town is amazing. The street looks beautiful and is accompanied by well-constructed houses. You&rsquo;ve got stone-paved roads and though I don&rsquo;t want to admit, this is much more majestic than Blumund. I know you don&rsquo;t want to lead it into a battlefield, but right now we must endure and wait for the reinforcements! The Blumund King has already decided to dispatch the Knight order, so all we need is a little more time to prepare&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;AH&mdash;Fuze-kun. Let&rsquo;s pause right there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided to interrupt him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m really sorry for these circumstances, but I won&rsquo;t be able to improve the situation if I don&rsquo;t interrupt him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong Rimuru-san? Have you come up with a battle plan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, hmm. N-not really a battle plan &hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you mind sharing it with us? In your defense, I know it&rsquo;s normal for you to suspect us, but right now I really hope you can trust&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;NO, NOT LIKE THAT, FUZE-KUN! I&rsquo;m glad you are worried, but the war has already ended!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;EH? Ended? Wha? W-What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm&mdash;how should I put it&hellip; In summary, I just eliminated them all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;EHHHH? What did you eliminate? Eliminate&mdash; W-What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze couldn&rsquo;t process what he just heard and begins to question me back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t really blame him for having this sort of reaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I mean-I mean the army of Farmus. I&rsquo;ve defeated them all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh&hellip;EHHHHHH&mdash;!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He shrieks out a weird noise and freezes on the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Youmu begins to pat Fuze&rsquo;s shoulder while Cabal comes forth to comfort him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Elen and Kido who stood by them start to tell him something along the lines of &ldquo;This whole thing is indeed quite unbelievable,&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exaggerating&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s been less than two weeks since the enemy has declared war on us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His prediction was&mdash;It will take roughly a week for the main force to arrive, so they will spend two to three days to clear out the enemies in the surrounding area of the battlefield to buy time and then deploy a defense perimeter around the city and brace for the worst.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In his view the war has already broken out, and our lack of defense seems to have confused Fuze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that he ran into everyone all gathered in the same place, he thought we were going to launch an attack altogether.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To think that the battle has already ended instead of the Farmus army arriving late&mdash;Having been told something like that, anyone would have a hard time accepting it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent my humble son Rigur as messenger to Blumund a few days ago. It would seem you have missed him. It&rsquo;s just as what Rimuru-sama said, the war is over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rigurdo comes forth to clarify with Cabal and Elen supplementing the details. Then Fuze finally accepted the fact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he still continues to mumble &ldquo;How is that possible&hellip;&rdquo;, it would take some time for him to digest the information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fifty soldiers who came along with him are also dumbfounded, so I told my guards to have them rest at our inn since they all seem extremely tired to the point where they could faint any second now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, they must have relaxed having just been told the war is already over. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to avoid the army of Farmus, they chose to march through the forests instead of the main roads. Marching with a full set of armor and gear in the forest is surely no easy task.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers expressed their gratitude and my guards escorted them away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only one left is Fuze, who now has a rather tired expression on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fuze, how about you go get some rest as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; You&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m still confused at the moment. I should probably get some rest&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze nods in response and decides to head towards the inn&hellip; Yet the timing was unfortunate as some new visitors just arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, more visitors, and they are&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;More visitors? What about them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze stops out of curiosity at my words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is due to him stopping that he&rsquo;s lost his chance to rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the Dwarf King himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel Dwargo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8 c19"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I just discovered something. My skill &ldquo;Magic Perception&rdquo; has evolved to &ldquo;Universal Perception&rdquo;. The radius of my detection has largely increased, and it has boosted the accuracy as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was able to detect the Legion of Pegasi that&rsquo;s still quite some distance away from the town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Announcement. Thirty pegasus knights have been detected closing in on the perimeter. Confirmed Leading individual: Gazel Dwargo. &gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My ultimate skill &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; nonchalantly reports. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem that due to the boost it received in accuracy, it can identify individuals I encountered in the past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s a convenient skill indeed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But with that being said&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is a bit too much information apart from the activities within the town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Honestly&mdash;I was going to complain about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For that reason, I hope you could simplify the content of the report, &ldquo;Great Sage&rdquo;&hellip; No, I should call it Raphael-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be more specific, you can report whoever intends to approach me in a harmful way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&hellip;Understood&mdash;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems to want to say something. But it&rsquo;s fine. I just need to pass on all the trouble to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have faith in it. That&rsquo;s how Raphael-san works.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I compressed my skill to minimum capacity and waited quietly for the guests to arrive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since my skill already identified them, whoever has arrived can&rsquo;t be imposters. They must be the real deal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t have time to inform Fuze before the Pegasus knights landed before us. Immediately after, Gazel got off the back of his pegasus and greets me with a laugh:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Long time no see, Rimuru. I heard rumors that you&rsquo;ve become a Demon Lord. Am I right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No wonder why the king himself came here. Of course he&rsquo;s here to talk about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose, Gazel. A lot happened, so I decided to become a Demon Lord. It is quite complicated, but I&rsquo;ll be drafting a series of plans.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I greet him so, giving him a wry smile and informing him of our meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Perfect timing. Then I&rsquo;ll join the conference too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel proclaims rather naturally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze still looks all battered up, but his expression suddenly changes as he closes in on me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;D-Demon Lord&hellip;????? What in the world is going on????&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He just happened to be around to hear our conversation. He probably thought this type of thing just can&rsquo;t be ignored and questioned me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that to him&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now it would only make things messier. But if I remain silent now, Fuze won&rsquo;t give up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-san, I can&rsquo;t just unhear what you just said! I did hear you say something about how you&rsquo;ve become a Demon Lord, riiiight&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze shivers as he says so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is he holding his pee? Go ahead and do it, don&rsquo;t be so polite with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you need to use the restroom? If so, our town&rsquo;s public toilet is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;NO! Who said that I want to go to the toilet!? It&rsquo;s not about that, it&rsquo;s about you becoming a Demon Lord&hellip; What in the world is going on&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I intended to use the toilet as an excuse but failed to get it through to Fuze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze also is no longer acting all respectful and is showing his true colors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. Oh, you mean the thing about the Demon Lord? I am one, yeah,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I answer casually, pretending it&rsquo;s no big deal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s clear he won&rsquo;t let me off the hook so easily though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, that&rsquo;s such a bad joke. I do hope you can answer this seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Eh&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c13 c2">Annoying. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Does he wish me to tell him from the start? Do we have to do it from the start? Well, King Gazel also seems intrigued to learn about it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But talking while standing isn&rsquo;t really convenient, so I should just make an explanation real quick.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I roughly recite the story to them. As a result, Fuze starts to talk to the air. It seems he&rsquo;s trying to escape reality by going catatonic. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh well, At least it&rsquo;s better than having him chanting doubts about my story all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decide to leave Fuze to his own devices and talk to King Gazel again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, Gazel, is it really alright if a king of a nation just departs like this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That actually does concern me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am equally guilty of the same crime, but King Gazel seems way too liberal with how he visits other countries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Dwarven Kingdom&mdash;The Armed Nation Dwargon &mdash; is a powerful nation. Its national savings alone would be dozen times more than my country&rsquo;s. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Would it really be okay if the King just moved out like this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, no problem. I&rsquo;ve got a body double!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Huh? You seem to be using your body double in the wrong place&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, or is it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something doesn&#39;t feel right, but I suppose that&rsquo;s how it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Pegasus commander Dorf-san as well as the other companions of the hero king have all arrived. That&rsquo;s one strong group of people to bring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not important, Rimuru. Is what Vesta reported to me three days ago true?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel switches his eyes to back to those unique to a nation&rsquo;s ruler and questions me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, those twenty thousand&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on a second, Rimuru. I&rsquo;ve heard that the Farmus army has vanished for no reason. Do you know anything about this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, vanished?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm? What is this now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Vesta reported to me that the army of twenty thousand men closing in on this town suddenly disappeared. What actually happened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel says slowly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A pair of eyes have been boring into Vesta in the corner, exerting an unseen pressure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I look towards Vesta and see him shaking his head in panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Vesta, I was there during your report as well. You did mention that the Farmus army suddenly vanished. We were curious and thus decided to come investigate. Did you find the reason for that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pan is the highest commander in chief of the Dwargon army as well as King Gazel&rsquo;s close ally. He also questions Vesta in a pressing tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, I get what&rsquo;s going on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel is trying to cover up the fact that I massacred the twenty-thousand-man army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, about that, we couldn&rsquo;t get to the bottom of it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vesta also seems to understand what they mean and answered carefully. He&rsquo;s been looking at Gazel and the rest&rsquo;s expressions and cleverly coordinated the conversation alongside them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suppose that&rsquo;s how smart people do things. Vesta&rsquo;s reactions are super-fast. Now the mess I left has been successfully covered up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel instead lowers his voice and whispers to me: &ldquo;Idiot! If you tell the truth now, you are making yourself an enemy of the humans!&rdquo; and similarly: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother yourself to make an enemy with the humans even though they will definitely fear you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It does make sense when I think about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone powerful enough to single-handedly wipe out an army of more than ten-thousand people. That&rsquo;s more deadly and terrifying than nuclear weapons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The less people who know the truth, the better. There really isn&rsquo;t any need for unrelated countries and citizens to be informed about this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The army of Farmus Kingdom attempted to invade the Monster Kingdom, yet encountered an unknown accident, leading to their disappearance as a whole&mdash;We will package this as the truth and inform the rest of the countries of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I see that Sasuga-King Gazel possesses the ability to deal with crises, a skill that I lack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the only problem remaining is just what I&rsquo;ve said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be too late to hide it from the people in the town. But the truth doesn&rsquo;t really matter to them. Everyone probably knows about it, but no one would go around and run their mouth about the news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze happens to be the center of my concern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I glance towards him. He has regained consciousness and our eyes happen to meet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, ah&mdash;Fuze-kun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-san&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right, what should I do now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just now I broke the breaking news to him that the entire Farmus army has been killed by my hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Should I tell him that all of this is just nonsense?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While I was still worrying, Fuze takes in a breath and sighs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then he raises both of his hands and respond:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything. Of course, my men are all resting at the inn now, and they definitely won&rsquo;t remember when they wake up tomorrow morning. We are so tired that they probably hallucinated and forgot everything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem he decided to pretend he hasn&rsquo;t heard anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze seems to have suddenly aged a lot, to the point that his entire body seems to be devoid of strength. There is a certain tragedy to this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, he was being so nice to have resorted to this in order to resolve the issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gufufufufu, if that&rsquo;s the case, just to be cautious, allow me to confirm it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man who&rsquo;s interrupted suddenly out of nowhere is Diablo, who now stands behind me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This Diablo is an amazing guy, too. He&rsquo;s like Doraemon,</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and answers to your every need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He also seems interested in doing chores.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also recall hearing him whisper that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;good at rewriting memory&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll pretend I never heard that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze still seems troubled, but he gave in at last. He won&rsquo;t intervene as long as his subordinates are kept safe and uninformed of the knowledge. He must have also agreed to King Gazel&rsquo;s view that the less people who know this, the better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as national interest is involved, he may dispose of whoever leaks out the information in the worst-case scenario. That&rsquo;s why he believes it is better to just let things slide this time with an eye closed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t look further in about your subordinate but do include me in the meeting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze also suggests his own view and says there&#39;s no negotiation with his term.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He probably thinks whatever is in the meeting cannot be simply ignored. You can tell from the determination in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright then. But I hope you all will trust me as well. I don&rsquo;t have any intention to antagonize humanity. So I won&rsquo;t stop you from attending the meeting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I shrug after finishing the sentence and agreed to let Fuze join the meeting.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rigurdo escorts Fuze to the lounge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Gazel&rsquo;s party also wishes to join the meeting, we have to tide up the meeting hall. Because of that, I want to have Fuze rest for now as much as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing all this, Gazel questions me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, are you sure that man is trustworthy, Rimuru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He is, it&rsquo;s all good here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze is indeed a trustworthy man. I answer with confidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. If that&rsquo;s the case, those people would be the only issue now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, Gazel gazes menacingly behind us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eh, are there people there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I turn my back in surprise and discover a group of strangers in front of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A gentleman in expensive clothing who is quite handsome. He must have been really popular in his prime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man has a rather unique pair of long and narrow eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are five other people who look like highly ranked military general that stand by the two sides of this gentleman. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can tell they have received good trainings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I didn&rsquo;t even notice with them being so close&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could this be, my &ldquo;Universal Perception&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t react at all&mdash;!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m rather panicked when this thought raises over me. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. There is no hostility detected from this group of people.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raphael-sama rather unpleasantly informs me. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, right, I see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;Ugh, this one is really on me. Just now I was complaining about receiving too much information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, my rather vague request of letting Raphael distinguish those who wish harm on me was quite unreasonable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t blame &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; for being mad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sorry! In the future I hope you&rsquo;ll just report everything as it is&mdash;I apologize from the bottom of my heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is rather embarrassing to apologize to my own skill, but it is the intent that matters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not noticing what I&rsquo;ve been doing, Gazel continued to converse with the mysterious group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where did you all come from?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a coincidence! Aren&rsquo;t you the king that likes to hide and live underground? What a surprise. I never expected chicken like you would come in aid of a &lsquo;Demon Lord&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That man is rather at ease with his attitude even with Gazel&rsquo;s imposing haki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s clearly trying to provoke Gazel, and the generals around him also look quite irritating as if they are saying &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t stand this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The coward would be you. You idiot elven offspring who likes to stay on high ground. Have you finally decided to visit the mortal realm from the City of God tree?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel seems to have seen through the act and hence disarmed his alert. Instead, he laughed smugly and teased the man back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the looks of it, Gazel and the man knew each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So Raphael&rsquo;s reaction was right in that he holds no hostility. Maybe it&rsquo;s just that Gazel and the man can&rsquo;t get along with each other. However, that may be too much considering the two just seem like friends who love bad-mouthing each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, they seem to be the messengers from Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The one who reported to me is Souei&rsquo;s subordinate Souka. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I heard he is responsible for leading these guests here. After that guy found out Gazel was present here too, he then decided to come and spice things up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You just never change, Elalude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two both give one another an awkward look and greet each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That seems to be their special way of greeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, so who is this young lady&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, nice to meet you, I am the leader of this forest, Rimuru. I look forward to our future encounter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This narrow eye man&mdash;Elalude has laid his eyes on me, so I decided to greet him a bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I should have welcomed him in a more proper ceremonial way considering he&rsquo;s a messenger from Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion. Despite that, I&rsquo;ve got no clue about the customs and elegancy of the such a ceremony.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though I&rsquo;ve become a Demon Lord, I still can&rsquo;t find experts in that field.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess it&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;ll just have to find an expert to enlighten me another time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I greet him, Elalude suddenly became fidgety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He started to shout with his eyes opened wide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So it is you! You are the Demon Lord that kidnapped my daughter! I hope you&rsquo;ve prepared yourself for what&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as he finished, he began to conjure a Greater Explosive Flame spell and starts the chanting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oi oi, could you be any less reckless, mister?! </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to my knowledge, Special Greater Explosive Flame spell is one of the most difficult type of magic to conjure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Fire is one of elemental-based magic and its spells range from Fireball all the way to Giant Magic Fireball. It becomes more difficult to control as the spell becomes more powerful. There are then more powerful spells such as Giant Magic Flame Barrier or Giant Magic Flame Storm that are very difficult to conjure. All in all, the difficulty of casting increases naturally with the power and scale of the spell.</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let&rsquo;s just analyze the name of spell casted by this Mister Elalude&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Special Greater Explosive Flame spell, to put it simply, is a synthesized magic spell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It contains Fire spell that can burn and the Explosive spell that could blow away the target&mdash;By combining the two branches of spell, one can sublimate the two into a higher level of Explosive Flame Magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of that, it happens to be the type of magic wielded by Shizu-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The difference is that Shizu-san relied also on the power of Ifrit. It&rsquo;s quite difficult to control a spirit if you aren&rsquo;t a conjuring expert such as Shizu-san. But, as long as you establish a trusting relationship with the spirit, it will help out in times of need and hence help control the power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in contrast, when we talk about Special Greater Explosive Flame&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is a very dangerous spell when one relies on himself to control the magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so, this type of magic is not limited by the magic system itself, so there is a lot of freedom in its usage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The casting speed, accuracy, power, scale, area of effect, duration of effect; one can freely distribute the spell&rsquo;s magnitude in all of these major elements. If he chooses to pursue purely power, it would be a piece of cake for him to cause havoc on the town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But of course, this also increases the risks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conjuring spells require magicules, as well as sufficient concentration of mental abilities in order to gather the required amount. If the conjurer is incapable of doing that, the magic would not be cast. In addition, once the casting failed, the remained magicules could go out of control and turn the nearby area to a wasteland.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it makes sense that why very few people actively practice such dangerous spells. Usually, only those who&rsquo;s obtained a rank higher than a magician could use these high-level spells for military purpose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And you </span><span class="c2 c16">definitely </span><span class="c1">shouldn&rsquo;t cast it in a town like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet that&rsquo;s exactly what Elalude is planning to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the hell is he doing. Acting like this out of nowhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He accused me of kidnapping his daughter, but what in the world is that supposed to mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although I still haven&rsquo;t been able to react, there isn&rsquo;t much need to be nervous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There is a loud tearing sound that goes </span><span class="c2 c16">Siiiii</span><span class="c1">&mdash;on the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What came at the same time was Elen&rsquo;s shouts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Waiiit, Dad! What are you doing here!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She came here angrily and realized the situation immediately. She then gave Elalude a chop on the head without saying a thing to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elen&rsquo;s arrival finally got Elalude&rsquo;s senses back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, it would seem this Elalude is actually Elen&rsquo;s father. He is finally settling down after he got scolded by an angry Elen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These types of people sure are troublesome for having such short temper. The image of a reasonable gentleman he built when he was talking to Gazel was completely toppled with his later actions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehh&mdash;Ahaha. Sorry, someone told me my daughter has been kidnapped by a Demon Lord. So I kinda panicked just now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He says so while laughing out delightfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But you can&rsquo;t just cast a Special Greater Explosive Flame spell on the town just like that! You are one daddy-gone-berserk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, sir. I&rsquo;ve told you the facts as they are. It was your own misunderstanding.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course! It&rsquo;s all dad&rsquo;s fault!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A secretary-looking person corrects Elalude calmly and Elen thus continues to blame him harshly, causing him look horrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He does look rather pitiful like that, but I can&rsquo;t sympathize with him. It&rsquo;s his own doing. I hope Elen will blame him more so he can reflect a little bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;You still spoil your daughter like always, Elalude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel comments at Elalude as the situation got slightly calmer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Elalude doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any regrets and argues back:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not spoiling her. It&rsquo;s all because Elen-chan is too cute and I can&rsquo;t help myself&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is the dictionary definition of spoiling&hellip;Never mind, it won&rsquo;t help even if I say anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel is dumbfounded. It seems that&rsquo;s how Elalude acted before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s probably no cure for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing that Gazel and Elalude have finished their conversation, Elen decided to slip in and greet Gazel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Long time no see, King Gazel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elen said as such. She seems to give off the attitude of a noble despite her adventurer outfit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it really Elen-chan? I didn&rsquo;t recognize you at first. Hope you are doing fine. It&rsquo;s really been a long time, you&rsquo;ve become prettier.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel greeted back, then Elalude starts to get all noisy and complains: &ldquo;Are you a pedophile? You better watch your back, Gazel!&rdquo; Thankfully, Elen immediately gave him a savage chop on the head, accompanied by the secretary-looking guy shutting his mouth up with hand in order to prevent him from further bad mouthing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel seemed rather used to it and simply shrugged it off without any comment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This guy seems to get very heated in the head whenever the topic was related to Elen. He usually acts gentle and cultured but has a large dichotomy at times. I&rsquo;ll note that for precaution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-san, this here is my father, Duke of Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion, Elalude Grimwald.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leader of Jura Great Forest, ruler of monster, my daughter Elen has introduced us. My name is Elalude Grimwald. Please call me Elalude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, Elen introduced her father Elalude to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t expect this man to be the head of the Sarion Duke&rsquo;s family. It seems the messenger from Sarion is not an insignificant man. I&rsquo;ve heard rumors that he is a relative of the Emperor, and is in fact, the emperor&rsquo;s uncle. No wonder he got to chat with Gazel so casually, since he is indeed qualified. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be perfectly clear, he is one of the top three most powerful persons in the Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That gave me quite the shock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">T-then Elen would be a super prominent daughter of a noble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve heard of her noble origin, but such prominent origin is really something else&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It won&rsquo;t be too much to address her as Mademoiselle</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c1">. A noble with such prominence deciding to become an adventurer&hellip; she may have been too liberal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I shouldn&#39;t be the only one thinking so, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps there are people secretly protecting her. She seemed to already know when she told me about the Demon Lord awakening that her leaking that information would have been exposed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cabal and Kido, these two followers must have a hard time accompanying her. I have to find a chance to compensate them&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, right now&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;So, did you come here just for Elen-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s probably not that simple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought to myself and looked towards Elalude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, of course not. I came here to discuss diplomatic relations with your country, as well as to confirm things with my own eyes. To check out who the mythical Slime really is and why my daughter took such a liking to you. It&rsquo;s quite unbelievable to witness your menacing aura as a leader despite the fact that you are actually a slime. But still, I wanted to test your ability.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude gives off an evil smile after saying so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why he casted that spell, to intentionally test us as it would seem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru, Shuna and Shion are all on hold next to me. My officers all did not fringe while facing off the danger. But that is only natural as they&rsquo;ve all predicted that he won&rsquo;t cast the spell. They&rsquo;ve grown a lot since they would likely have lost their temper if it was the old them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve analyzed the spell you were going to cast, but it was obvious that your magicule count did not meet the basic requirement.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna says so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems his bluff has been seen through, Elalude also throws a wry smile to tease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My my, now I&rsquo;ve been exposed of my incompetency.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s really something how you&rsquo;ve controlled the speed of your casting to mislead others in believing the magic is going to be casted. It&rsquo;s very admirable how you are able to utilize that homunculus body of yours so thoroughly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Elalude mocking himself, Shuna responds gently. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? That&rsquo;s surprising. Have you found out that this body is artificial?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. It would seem you&rsquo;ve inserted your astral body into it. The famous technology of the Sorcerer Dynasty Sarion surely lives up to its fame as the nation with endeavor of magic. Very impressive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing Shuna&rsquo;s words, I also try to run an &ldquo;Appraisal&rdquo;. Indeed, out of the entire group, only Elalude is using a homunculus body. It would seem that it is part of the effort to protect such a famous noble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I thought he didn&rsquo;t bring enough guards when he came to meet someone who claims to be Demon Lord. If I think that way, dwarf king Gazel is the exception.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But anyway, the homunculus is so skillfully crafted that it looks realistic enough to be indistinguishable from real people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once we&rsquo;ve settled our business here, I need to ask him to teach me the techniques.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude mentioned that his intent is to assess the diplomacy between our countries. But that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the only thing on his mind. I suppose we will figure out later, there&rsquo;s no need to rush out for an answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps I should invite Elalude to the meeting as well for him to make further judgements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also wish to hear what&rsquo;s his opinion on the future policies our country may adapt, it will be a great opportunity. But it depends on the result of the meeting. It is possible that even Sarion may become hostile to us. However, if things really go down that path, I&rsquo;ll have to deal with it then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta came to inform us that the preparations for the meeting are completed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was planning to discuss things with my own subordinates, but I don&rsquo;t seem to have the opportunity right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only so, we are heading straight to the official meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was planning to prepare information on the countries beforehand to better inquire them. That&rsquo;s how a diplomat would often do to engage first, observe each other&rsquo;s interests and conflicts so as to reach a common ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since we&rsquo;ve not done any rehearsal beforehand, everyone will just have to express their genuine views.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our future would be dependent on this meeting. If we fail to reach an agreement, it is no exaggeration that it will lead to war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I boost my own spirit and head towards the meeting room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, the essential meeting that would decide the future of the Jura-Tempest Federation now begins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;This meeting would be bestowed with a legendary status, and historically known as the Meeting between Human and Monster.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I enter the meeting room and see everyone standing, awaiting my arrival.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are the three Beastketeers, Fuze, King Gazel and Duke Elalude. The VIPs of each country are directed to their special seats and are seated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After they sat, I walked towards the most inner seat while everyone sat down rather unanimously. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The meeting is commenced in a solemn environment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First off, we need to introduce all the participants of the meeting. After all, there are many members here who came from strong nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some of us know them, but in order to avoid any disrespect, it&rsquo;s best to introduce everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, we begin to introduce the guests.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, we shall introduce the guests.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Following my look, Shuna understood my order and begins to announce the names.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beast Kingdom Yuurazania. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The spokespersons consisted of the three Beastketeers who represent the Beast King&rsquo;s army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thinking about it, Phobio and Suphia are rather&mdash;let&rsquo;s just say&mdash;single-minded. So we should probably prioritize Alvis&rsquo; opinions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dwarven Kingdom&mdash;The Armed Nation of Dwargon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Spokesperson is the King himself&mdash;Gazel Dwargo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was just trying to hide the fact that I wiped out a twenty thousand-men sized army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He may be planning something else though. So I&rsquo;d better factor that in to accommodate his op.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s may be doing me a lot of favor this time as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kingdom of Blumund.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, this nation did not send an official representative. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Fuze is the head of the Freedom Association Branch in Blumund, plus he&rsquo;s closely related to Baron Bayette who is a minister of Blumund Kingdom, he should have the same rank of authority to him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s undoubtedly the best representative they can choose. I should really listen to his precious opinions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next one is Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They suddenly came to participate, yet the head of the group is the famous noble Duke Elalude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude is the dumb father who spoils his daughter, but who nonetheless possesses the cruel outlook of a noble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The goal of their trip is to assess my country. He probably wouldn&rsquo;t make any misjudgment and do anything stupid due to the love he has for his daughter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That guy is something else, and I definitely can&rsquo;t overlook him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion has the national power to stand against the council states by itself, and it&rsquo;s a superpower rivalling the Armed Nation of Dwargon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If everything goes smoothly, we may even get to forge an alliance with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One shouldn&rsquo;t be too greedy, that&rsquo;s how the saying goes. That&rsquo;s why I need to treat it carefully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glancing at the surrounding guests, everyone is a prominent character.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it is only me that is holding the meeting, I may not be able to think sufficiently objectively. Considering that point, it is truly lucky for me to have the human members participating in the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What follows is the introduction of the members of the Monster Nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are some familiar figures, but I should still do an introduction for the officers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I look at Rigurdo and the Goblin elders. Nowadays, they all look the part with luxurious clothing that can compete against any other nations&rsquo; representative.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They even look more imposed than me, it makes me feel like I&rsquo;m able to depend on them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ministers of different departments greet everyone. The moderator of the forest, Dryad Treyni-san, also came to greet them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude looks rather surprised at the presence of the highest-ranking species to show up here, but he still pretends to be calm and greets back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel&rsquo;s initial reaction to the scene was also interesting, they were all quite surprised by that before. Anyway, I shouldn&rsquo;t be going around and exposing them like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At last I introduce the relevant personnel from the Farmus Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Especially Youmu&rsquo;s party, alongside Myuran and Grucius. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was planning to let these people to build up a new nation there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, I don&rsquo;t know whether they will accept if I raise the proposals during the meeting&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This proposal may be the determining factor to the success of the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nod to notify Shion and Diablo who were waiting for orders behind me. Thus, I was able to roughly conclude the round of self-introduction from our side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, right, I almost forgot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shuna, what&rsquo;s the progress on Veldora&rsquo;s clothes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Veldora-sama is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna couldn&rsquo;t even finish before the delightful laughter of &ldquo;GA&mdash;HAHAHA&rdquo; arrives. I was worried that his original outfit would seem unfit for such occasion, so I requested Shuna to help him make a random set of clothes. It would seem I was able to catch up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the meeting room door is opened, Veldora enters the meeting room as if he&rsquo;s visiting a tourist place. I rise up to introduce Veldora and direct him to rest of the participants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hope this one can go smoothly; I pray to myself&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Allow me to introduce him to my fellow guests. Some of you may have heard of his name, so please remain calm&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decide to make a forecast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My subordinates are all now aware of his identity, and they all look nervous while gulping in tension. The legendary evil dragon is right before them, and even they are afraid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I found that the atmosphere has changed, there was a sudden silence at the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And next&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is my ally Veldora.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Veldora! Some people seem to call me &ldquo;Storm Dragon&rdquo;. Hmm, not a lot of people get to talk to me in equal term so count yourselves lucky. And you should feel honored!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as I called his name, Veldora immediately proceeded with this introduction. He&rsquo;s still arrogant as always, but it does suit him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought I told him to stay quietly during the meeting&hellip; He probably got bored immediately and came to stir things up&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hope you can act as the consultant of our meeting today. I&rsquo;ll be happy if you just stand aside and play nice. So could you leave now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gahahaha, Rimuru, you are so ruthless! Stop bullying me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen now, we are talking business here, so could you stop causing a scene here, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Trust me! How could I cause a scene now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora gave me his word, so I&rsquo;ll have to comply&hellip; If that doesn&rsquo;t work, I&rsquo;ll then give him his bible (manga). I must prevent him from giving me any trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up until now, the room is completely silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone is frozen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And&hellip;Eh?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pong-dong&rdquo;! Fuze, Elen and a couple few others just fainted on the spot while Gazel starts shouting: &ldquo;Pause, pause! I need to talk to you NOW, Rimuru!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rigurdo and the rest decide to start kneeling and bowing their heads like last time&mdash;The situation has gone wild beyond repair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You could figure out why the meeting has been interrupted with your knees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;Or rather, the meeting hasn&rsquo;t even started yet. But it&rsquo;s no use saying that now&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The meeting room is in a mess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The chaos was greater than I expected. It&rsquo;s Armageddon in here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora sure is a mean character.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">People are truly afraid of this &ldquo;Storm Dragon&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, that is to be expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sudden appearance of the Catastrophe rank monster would undoubtedly cause such a commotion. To the world, he is more horrifying than Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thankfully, not everyone thinks that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since there will inevitably be chaos, it&rsquo;s best if I just introduce him to everyone first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem I need to take Veldora into consideration for my future planning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The guests from each nation looks ill with their strength all gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though Veldora has already suppressed his aura, it may still have affected the crowds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My companions such as Benimaru or Shion would usually contain their aura, while the weaker monster and humans who visit this town have also gotten used to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The new addition to the crew, Diablo, has the ability to suppress his aura even better than me. He is very talented in that aspect and should be considered as a model for everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The issue lies with Veldora, who is supposed to have special training session with me to learn about the techniques to control his aura.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he said in all confidence that this was nothing. I think it&rsquo;s likely due to his evolved Ultimate Skill &ldquo;Investigation King Faust&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I thought everything would be fine&hellip; was I being too naive?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, his aura was still leaking out even with the seal applied, preventing monster below Rank B from approaching.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be safe, I tried to use &ldquo;Appraisal&rdquo; to determine the magicules in the room, but I found nothing out of place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, the reason would be&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru, I&rsquo;ve got something to talk to you about. Let&rsquo;s pause the meeting and so I can borrow some of your time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel pats my shoulder and proposes, with a charming smile on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was just shouting &hellip; he must be really serious. My instinct tells me to not resist him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I tell everyone that the meeting would be put on hold for a moment and start to move out from my seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one seems to object.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s no wonder, since someone has already fainted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After leaving the rest of the matters to the others, we head towards the reception room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I followed Gazel&rsquo;s order to get Veldora away from the rest of the meeting so that shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue any longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Including the three Beastketeers, a lot of people wish to learn about Veldora&rsquo;s current status. That may buy us some time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ones entered in the room are Gazel and Elalude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I requested that Shuna go make tea for the rest of the people at the meeting and told Benimaru and Shion to take care of the meeting room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just to be clear, her majesty the Emperor has granted me full authority on this issue. So I will speak of my stance in the name of the Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion. Now that you are informed of that, please explain the situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude is the first to talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is no longer a dumb father at the moment, but a politician, the prominent nobleman of Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is very imposing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Does Sarion want to sit and watch quietly how this event unfolds?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They don&rsquo;t seem to hold any hostility, and by what he proposed, they would be observing my every move before determining their relationship with our country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Elalude would probably still need to clean up the mess that Elen did&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least I know they are not enemies, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem to look to them for help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand. Then I&rsquo;ll swear to tell you the whole truth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the other side has laid out their cards, I also need to be more serious about the issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With our agreement made, a secret meeting is thus unfolded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s hear what Gazel has to say first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, what do you wish to talk about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Spare me the act. What the hell is it with the revival of the &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even man like Gazel couldn&rsquo;t conceal his surprise. His shout sounds rather agitated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a rare sight for someone as calm as Gazel. He must have really been shocked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could have figured out a way to play dumb, but it would be meaningless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I decide to roughly explain the entire story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said however, I only mentioned about meeting Veldora in the cave and assisting him in breaking the seal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as I finished the short account, Gazel begins to have headache and starts to groan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I could not have anticipated things to turn out like this. It&rsquo;s already a mess now that you&rsquo;ve become a Demon Lord, but you&rsquo;ve made an even bigger mess&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">Ehh, no need to praise me like that</span><span class="c1">&mdash;I wanted to say that to ease the mood but chose not to. It may be my misjudgment, but I think it would piss Gazel off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Rimuru-dono. That lord is really&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Elalude asked, I nod towards him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora could actually properly conceal his aura like that, which is rather hard for him to believe in such short time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I suppose it&rsquo;s true, it must have been the real deal. No man or monster would be stupid enough to try and fool people with the name of that evil dragon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It actually makes a lot of sense with how he phrases it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s probably why Elen and Fuze believed the case immediately after hearing it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only monster, who are aware of the importance of names, but even humans know they stand to gain no benefit by pretending to be the evil dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Essentially, Gazel has not doubted his identity from the start. I asked him why afterward and only got the response that &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see him through.&rdquo;. In other words, Gazel has indirectly admitted that he can read minds. That&rsquo;s really impressive! But that really isn&rsquo;t the focus of the issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, what should we do&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, I&rsquo;m already in a terrible spot trying to clean up the mess left by my daughter&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel and Elalude look at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two seem to be unable to get along, but they are probably very close friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The real issue would be whether to go public with this, or to conceal it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It should be fine to do so in the western nations. As for Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion, I&rsquo;ll just tell the Emperor what I&rsquo;ve heard. The problem is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Western Saints Church, right? You can never fool them. Among all the &lsquo;True Dragons:&rsquo;, the Church hates the &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo; the most. They would definitely be on to him as soon as he had been revived.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If we are to hide the truth, we have to act together as if we have no clue. But that likely won&rsquo;t work and render us all &lsquo;Nemesis of God&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that, the two exchanged their opinions and attempted to figure a solution for my situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What about me? My job is simple. I just need to nod and say &ldquo;Hmm hmm&rdquo; to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you even listening, Rimuru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, your problem is causing us two headaches. If you don&rsquo;t take it seriously, we would really be troubled!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eh, I got scolded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suppose I should give in and reflect, and then talk about my own views.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Since there is no way we can keep hiding about Veldora, I&rsquo;ve planned to make it public. There&rsquo;s no way around Western Saints Church but whatever, so we would eventually need find a solution.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, since you&rsquo;ve decided, I have no objection.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel agreed without any argument.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;An alliance between Demon Lord and True Dragon is no joking matter. Honestly, the problem at hand is surprisingly difficult to deal with. But on second thought, I&rsquo;m lucky to be here. Since right now I get to participate in this meeting and was fortunate enough to gain such useful information to determine my nation&rsquo;s stance&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude smirks and expresses his view from a powerful nation&rsquo;s point of view. That is&mdash;If both the Disaster-Rank Demon Lord and the Catastrophe-Rank True Dragon somehow coexists in the same nation, it would be foolish to try and mess with them. Gazel agrees to his view as he nods heavily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In terms of scale, Tempest Federation is far from more powerful nations such as Dwargon and Sarion. But if it&rsquo;s only in terms of military, not only would these two nations be on the same playfield as ours, they may even be unable to surpass us. They say so because this has been acknowledged by both Gazel and Elalude in private.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If according to your words, you will both stand on the same frontline with us if we become an enemy with the Western Saints Church, am I on the right track?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as I ask, Gazel replies dismally:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you have to ask this? Rimuru, you&rsquo;ve got to practice on how to maintain your composure&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then he shows an annoyed look and says, &ldquo;Thank god this is a private meeting&hellip;&rdquo;and begins to explain to me in details.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They both have no need to antagonize my nation but at the same time, they can&rsquo;t let their own nations be in danger. Plus, they won&rsquo;t be responsible for dealing with the Western Saints Church.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel promises that he will maintain a neutral relationship while forging a diplomatic tie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, there&rsquo;s only Elalude left&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We basically don&rsquo;t even have any diplomatic tie with Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion. Even under such condition, this man still decide to greatly back us up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be reassured with Gazel&rsquo;s help. And speaking of which, Elalude-san&mdash;sama, why have you been so proactive&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I ask, Elalude responds with an annoyed look and answers:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;There&rsquo;s no need for &ldquo;san&rdquo; or &ldquo;sama&rdquo; when you talk to me. But Rimuru-dono, please remember to refer to others with their appropriate titles and occupations in public. You are, after all, a king, so you shouldn&rsquo;t act all groveling towards foreign guests in public. If you wished to be vassalized (bring into a condition of subordination), that would be a different matter. Anyhow, allow me to answer your question&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He gave me a special instruction in fear of me embarrassing myself, I suppose he has an empathetic side too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This thought made me express my appreciation, before I find Elalude is staring at me with long sighs. Then he switches up his mood and explain his reasons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It all started with his daughter Elen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was rumored that Elen has been held responsible due to her sharing of the Demon Lord awakening information to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, she was an accomplice in catalyzing the birth of a new Demon Lord. That&rsquo;s why there is no way the nation would leave it like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, Grand Duke Elalude was able to show his ways during this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was able to cover up the inquisition and made it so that the emperor was the only one aware of the situations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterward he spent the time predicting his future moves and wait for the right opportunity to strike.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Magical surveillance seems to be a difficult task to execute, yet through it, Elalude was able to find out about my evolution to Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He can just pretend he knows nothing had I not become one, but there would be no way around but to intervene if the transformation was successful. When he came to visit me, he has already planned for the worst and recognized there may even be a need to dispatch invasive forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Based on all these reasons, I went out myself in hope of less people finding out about this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude concludes like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, if he was to confirms I am an evil individual, he would destroy everything as soon as possible to cover up the truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, what would be your judgement?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve said, I don&rsquo;t plan to become your enemy, rather we should build up a friendly relationship.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see, he has accepted me. I&rsquo;m quite happy that I&rsquo;ve been judged as someone who&rsquo;s not evil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, that would be the natural choice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. Our country practices freedom of religion, which includes more than just the Ruminas sect. Rather dying for one religion, I&rsquo;d put our national interests in the priority.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh. I thought that I couldn&rsquo;t see you eye to eye, but somehow, we&rsquo;ve reached some common ground now. Elalude, my nation is also not in line with the ideology of Western Saints Church. I&rsquo;ve planned to support building ties with the Tempest Federation from the start.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon saying so, Gazel and Elalude smiles at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, there are still too many questions left. Regarding the Farmus army eliminated by Rimuru-dono, even if we spread out the claim that they&rsquo;ve all died from the war, the death count is still too high. And with just that point, my daughter has suggested&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude looks rather confused while saying so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could this be his real intent?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t the focus whether I am evil or not, he is afraid of the real casualty numbers of the war being spread in the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no way anyone would think otherwise that a Demon Lord who murdered twenty-thousand people is not evil. The Western Saints Church definitely would have a more justified testimony, and I would be treated as a &ldquo;Nemesis of God&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right, having diplomatic tie with such an evil person&mdash;me, would indeed implicate badly on these nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What to do then? Ehh&mdash;I began to worry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as I was thinking, Gazel gives off a grin and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ve got a solution.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, no way!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If according to what Gazel just said, the king of Farmus suddenly vanished from the world!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All of the corpses have disappeared without trace. Wouldn&#39;t they suspect that there was no survivor?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then you get to alter the story however you want&rdquo;&mdash;Gazel smiles and respond.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;The truth matters very little to the people and the other countries. As long as the story is pleasant to the ear, it would suffice the crowds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh&mdash;That is a wonderful idea. Gazel, surely you would want me to co-write the script with you, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude also switches to his politician eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They probably arrange narrative in their interests to maintain their innocence. For Elalude it is probably for both national interest and for Elen&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then I should make my resolve as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, I decided to save everyone at the cost of massacring twenty-thousand people. My faith won&rsquo;t shake even if I had to bear more sin than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems you&rsquo;ve decided to walk the grey area, Rimuru. That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s how it should be. It&rsquo;s not easy being a king.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s no use regretting things now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is a necessary process.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long made up my mind. Then, how do you plan to explain to the world, Gazel?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehe, let&rsquo;s see now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel&rsquo;s gaze became a bit gentler.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterward we spent an hour to discuss and layout the plan carefully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we returned to the meeting room, peace has been restored.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were finally able to get back to the peaceful atmosphere before and took care of the ones fainted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The unexpected reaction plunged the meeting in chaos, but it really couldn&rsquo;t be helped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s just let the past stay in the past and focus on dealing with the future. Thankfully I was able to discuss a solution with Gazel and Elalude. Now that I think back carefully that period of time was really precious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze, Elen and some others are still exhausted and collapsed in the chair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you guys alright? How do you feel now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I ask out of care. But instead they all look at me with resentment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Even I&rsquo;ve not heard of it. Such an IMPORTANT THING&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you kidding me, you big meanie! You even kept me out of the scene&hellip; His name is Veldora&hellip;-san? And he is your good friend?! Have you even mentioned that to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And all sorts of complaint flew straight at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Would it really help by complaining about it to me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s been swallowed by me into my &ldquo;Stomach&rdquo;&mdash;How could I even say something like that. Plus, would anyone even believe that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ehh? I didn&rsquo;t mention? Did I now&hellip;? Never mind, let&rsquo;s just forget about the past, pretty please (&#12291;&acute;</span><span class="c23">&forall;</span><span class="c2">&#65344;)? There&rsquo;re more important things to do, so let&rsquo;s have a meeting now! (&acute;</span><span class="c23">&forall;</span><span class="c1">`)&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I responded with a delightful smile, but it obviously didn&rsquo;t work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;DON&rsquo;T PLAY DUMB&mdash;!!!&rdquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They all shouted at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ha&hellip;hahaha~ yes-yes&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I try to calm everyone day with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s really because these people are too carefree. After all, they didn&rsquo;t change their attitudes at all, even after I became a Demon Lord&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t mind them being so casual to me, and I&rsquo;m even happy for that&hellip;But I do hope they can be more polite&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you even listening? Gosh, I hope you would genuinely reflect yourself!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please stop doing this, master.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m getting heart failure from it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they don&rsquo;t seem to follow basic courtesy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that&rsquo;s how Elen and her party act.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze is also the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, but&mdash;I need to report this to my superior&hellip; Eh, but I am the head of the branch!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s how he acts, always so carefree. He has accepted the reality of the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His reaction before of fearing Veldora seems to be fake. But if I hadn&rsquo;t told him to visit the restroom, he would probably have already pissed himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nice save! I pat his shoulder and got stared at instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You now, don&rsquo;t act like it&rsquo;s none of your business&hellip;I&rsquo;m gonna have to report this to my superior first. I&rsquo;ll come back later to take the compensation for my mental damage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My advice saved him, and I&rsquo;d expected him to thank me. But somehow, he argued back and scolded me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never mind, I will be the bigger man here. I was joking with him anyway. And Fuze got back on his normal feet quick enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;That&rsquo;s how everyone accepted Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is an hour later by the time the meeting restart.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now the meeting can be officially commenced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We will discuss Clayman&rsquo;s declaration of war later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei has briefed me on this and he hasn&rsquo;t been able to find their base yet. I, on the other hand, was more concerned about whether Clayman was on the move. So I had Souei keep an eye on that as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since you can&rsquo;t exactly rush this, I&rsquo;ve decided to finish the meeting with the heads of each nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although it&rsquo;s rather troublesome, let us revisit the story once more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were many things that took place in between, so I decided to spare everyone the details. In order to get everyone on the same page, I started to explain the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It started from my encounter with Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also told them my identity as a &ldquo;Otherworlder&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since there&rsquo;s no need to keeping hiding it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since all of my subordinates know of my story, it would make little difference to inform Gazel and Elalude. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what that a Demon Lord was once a &ldquo;Otherworlder&rdquo;? Demon Lord Leon was also a &ldquo;Otherworlder&rdquo;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also briefly explained my battle against the Orc Lord as well the construction of the town here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is very important to share the information with others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Given their interpretation from a different point of view, they may have a different reaction than mine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were more things that happened after the construction of the town&hellip; And I proceeded to talk about my journey to Ingracia Kingdom to fulfill Shizu-san&rsquo;s will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I did skip the details of the life at the town and Yuuki&rsquo;s request, but I also mentioned about my duel with Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was really strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If her opponent wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve been me, they would have been killed already.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not even Benimaru plus Souei would survive that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She may have been as strong as Hakurou, perhaps even stronger. She was also able to cast many unknown magics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Especially &ldquo;Holy Purification Barrier&rdquo;, that one is extremely dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There may even be a mini-scale one for battle against single enemy. I share my memories and knowledge to everyone using &ldquo;Telepathy Net&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although I&rsquo;m unsure whether we would be able to deal with it, we are better off knowing our opponents&rsquo; abilities when we encounter them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I need to try my best to let everyone realize how terrifying Hinata really is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least it will give them a better chance to escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hinata Sakaguchi, right? That woman does look very cruel and gives off the impression of a ruthless murderer. But according to our intel, the reality does not check out. For instance, she will give aid to whoever seek help from her as well as those who are willing to accept her aid. But if the people are not willing to listen to her, she would just stop helping. A very rational woman&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Does Fuze secretly know Hinata? He&rsquo;s been defending her all the time during my explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t want to be hostile against Hinata either, but she simply won&rsquo;t listen to me&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It does sound like something she would do to exclude those who refuses to listen to her from the aid list.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all there are probably a lot of people seeking refuge, you can&rsquo;t blame her for letting go of those idiots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A true rationalist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki did mention that Hinata is a realist, so Fuze&rsquo;s report was not wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that said, Fuze&rsquo;s source is surprisingly accurate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel also nods along as my thought continues to this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, as expected of the Blumund branch head, you are good at manipulating the information network. The precision of the intelligences you&rsquo;ve collected can match up against those obtained by our nation&#39;s&rsquo; secret service. I can vouch for the accuracy of the intelligences.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel speaks as if he&rsquo;s playing along with Fuze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Hinata won&rsquo;t even hear my explanation&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But that woman won&rsquo;t even give me a chance to explain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, she has treated me as an eyesore from the start. But it seemed that she had been fed with the wrong information, but the part of not listening to reason is just&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that may be because of the doctrine of Ruminas sect &ldquo;No negotiation with monsters&rdquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude surprisingly answered my confusion. Hinata seems to be rather famous even in Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion. You can tell then her reputation is widely spread, which surprises me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;No, perhaps it is the natural things from a nation&rsquo;s perspective to gather intelligence on the strongest knight in the Western Saints Church.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe she became a celebrity because of her beauty&mdash;Such a though flew over me a couple of times, but I should probably not say it out loud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After hearing the explanation by Fuze and the rest, I now begin to understand who Hinata really is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is known for her cruelty in actions and words, and it&rsquo;s said to have never broken the doctrines of her religion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is the most ideal model for the Knights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, Hinata is the guardian of law and order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if that&rsquo;s the case, why hasn&rsquo;t she stopped the summoning ritual by all the nations?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a simple summoning ritual and would usually summon children. No matter how you look at it, these all seem to be reckless actions of individual countries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Regarding that, there is no way we could know whether she has interfered with the summoning ritual of the nations, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze speaks up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suppose that&rsquo;s right as well&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The summoning magic that would bring &lsquo;Otherworlder&rsquo; are not knowledge to the public and are secret techniques strictly prohibited by the laws of the Western Council States. So, these nations won&rsquo;t easily admit their actions. No investigation can be led as long as they insist they&rsquo;ve not used the summoning magic. The Western Saints Church may have access to a wide range of authorities, but they can&rsquo;t interfere with domestic policies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For instance, the Farmus Kingdom has been using &ldquo;Otherworlder&rdquo; as weapons. They would probably argue that these are just &ldquo;Otherworlder&rdquo; they discovered and took in by chance in order to avoid regulations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this way, there&rsquo;s indeed no definitive evidence to support any claims. The Western Saints Church wouldn&rsquo;t be able to intervene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s true, it would be unfair to blame Hinata for not being more proactive on the issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right, Yuuki also said something else about her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;He said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figure her out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps Hinata has acted in her own way in order to stop the summoning rituals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if it is, it won&rsquo;t solve anything by worrying myself with this any longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyway, Hinata is probably gonna be hard to deal with. If she is willing to listen, I may find a chance to talk to her and resolve our misunderstanding&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if the Western Saints Church consider us the &ldquo;Nemesis of God&rdquo;, our confrontation with Hinata would then be inevitable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wouldn&rsquo;t want to fight her if possible, but we&rsquo;ll see how things develop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu. Should I personally set out to end her life for you? Shouldn&#39;t we get rid of the dangerous individuals to prevent further grievances?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing my own mumblings, Diablo, who&rsquo;s been waiting for order behind me, makes such proposal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This guy is surprisingly confident. He&rsquo;s a newbie, so he seems to be very eager towards every possible opportunity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi oi, even I lost to Hinata&mdash;no, even I fought to a draw with her! How could you be so confident in handling her?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seriously, please go through your brain before you speak, okay?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Diablo. Instead of sending cheap shot like you, I shall go kill that woman. So Rimuru-sama, please give me the order now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You see. Now Diablo&rsquo;s nonsense has drawn out Shion as well!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ho ho, so it&rsquo;s Shion-san. I am grateful that you&rsquo;ve taught me the techniques of being a secretary, so I&rsquo;ll put it lightly&hellip; It&rsquo;s a shame that you are no match for Hinata.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? So according to what you just said, do you think you are stronger than me? Interesting, how about we find out about that right here right now&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;SILENCE!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I shout out to stop the sudden confrontation between Diablo and Shion.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 581.50px; height: 870.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 581.50px; height: 870.67px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I didn&rsquo;t expect him to be so aggressive despite his calm look. He&rsquo;s so polite to me yet has no respect for his seniors. How arrogant is he for a newbie</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c1">?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Getting into conflict by provoking the opponent without themselves noticing, these types of people have such a straightforward personality like Shion&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gahahahaha! Does that mean you wish to send me out? Very well, I shall return triumph in no time&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to go! Unless they decide to take the initiative in offense, we don&rsquo;t have to be the aggressor. I&rsquo;ll say this again, I don&rsquo;t want to antagonize the Western Saints Church.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having been excited by the two, Veldora who&rsquo;s been sitting next to me suddenly decides to stand up. I give off a long sigh after stopping him immediately after.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horrible, these three are all maladjusted children.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No no no, everyone still has space to grow. I just have to focus on educating them in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that I think about it carefully, Benimaru and Souei are a lot more composed. Geld is still very trustworthy since he&rsquo;s always been sensible. Gabiru could get cocky at times, but he has learned to watch the mood, so it&rsquo;s a lot of weight off my shoulders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ranga instead is still staying quietly as a listener in my shadow, and he&rsquo;s more lovable than the rest of the crew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem lies on these three, Shion, Diablo and Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The situation is always dangerous with these three around. I feel like I&rsquo;m getting more and more mental stress.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve got to be more cautious dealing with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyhow, the topic regarding Hinata and the Western Saints Church ends here. We&rsquo;ll see how they react, and act based on that. Since this may lead to a war, we will have to observe carefully every step.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I proclaim so and concluded the whole thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there&rsquo;s one more thing I shouldn&rsquo;t forget. There are people secretly maneuvering behind the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hinata knew of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She said someone snitched to her, but luckily, I can count on two hands the people who knew about me killing Shizu-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It won&rsquo;t be easy to find the culprit, but the ones who know me are the most suspicious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is the trio of Cabal, Elen and Kido, alongside Fuze and a couple more people from Blumund Kingdom. Then it is Yuuki. The rest would be my own people from the town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; has filtered out the list of the suspects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, this is about right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But with that being said, it may have also been to the involvement of unknown parties&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t want to act on a single instinct or suspect other people without evidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll just have to remember to keep reminding myself to be extra cautious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why would the person want me to confront Hinata?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Does he wish me to take out Hinata?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To prevent me from returning home perhaps?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or perhaps to draw out Hinata?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&mdash;Perhaps all of the above.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No way, that&rsquo;s way too greedy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have no idea of the opponent&rsquo;s intent. But I&rsquo;ve got to endure even though it feels bad getting manipulated like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyway, I&rsquo;ll stand by on this matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I continue to recount the events.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I told them that I discovered that our town has been attacked after I returned to the nation from the fight against Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were &ldquo;Otherworlder&rdquo; sent by Farmus Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to save those who sacrificed themselves during this invasion, I decided to walk the path of Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But before I could inform them of what followed, Elen decide to break some news herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t daddy know about that already? Aren&rsquo;t you here because of that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looks up to Elalude and asks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Honestly, doing this kind of thing is just cheating. Too cute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, her poor dumb dad Elalude would probably be charmed instantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Elen&hellip;It&rsquo;s alright if I know about it, but you don&rsquo;t need to tell that to the rest of the country representatives&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude sighs helplessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I understand how you feel completely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elen does not care for the overall situation and that&rsquo;s her fault. But luckily, Elalude seemed to have predicted how things would be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My daughter Elen would definitely announce that she taught other people to become Demon Lords. I&rsquo;ll have to force her to come back home. But if I do so, just to have her dislike me in the end, it would be the worst strategy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, he said a bunch of things that makes one question whether he is a genius or an idiot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As it turns out his prediction was on point, so I suppose he&rsquo;s a genius then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have been feeling something to be amiss, so I exchange looks with Gazel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I found him nodding in agreement, so we decide to move on according to the plan we just settled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;And that&rsquo;s how it was. I used the army of Farmus Kingdom as sacrifice and became a Demon Lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that, I proclaim the truth of my evolution to Demon Lord to everyone.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alright, so that concluded the explanation. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now we will get to the main topic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Everything I just said was true, but we will have to modify its narrative when we go public with it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My words baffled everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Going public means we would be telling the story to the outside world&mdash;To Majins, who consider power to be everything, such an act seems to be meaningless. No wonder why everyone seems confused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But deception and disguise are important elements in politics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, what reasons would you find and how would you modify it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru asks for the crowds. I condensed the content of our secret meeting into simple terms before explaining to everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would proclaim to have become Demon Lord but will hide the fact that I&rsquo;ve awakened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is based on the fact that the nations are oblivious of the full story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because none of them sent anyone to investigate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since all the witnesses have been killed, the only who know the truth are us the and the remaining three survivors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Farmus King is known to be a greedy man in nature, so our defense would be justified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s because to the people, the saying that the army lost in a war is more acceptable than the army has been wiped out by a single Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Furthermore, the large number of corpses also unlocked the most evil seal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, the large amount of flesh blood sunken into this land and awakened the slumbering evil dragon&mdash;It led to the revival of &ldquo;Storm Dragon&rdquo; Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The champion Youmu and the leader of Jura Great Forest (me), who wanted to become a Demon Lord, came to aid and convinced Veldora through the sacrifice of many monsters. In this way we were able to quench the anger of Veldora and starts to worship him as a guardian.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we are to alter the truth like this, my ascension to Demon Lord would make sense. Not only that, we are able to be justified as the victims while blaming everything else on the Farmus Kingdom. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone think about it. Humans always fear that which they don&rsquo;t understand, and they are often too ignorant to admit it. When someone who can single-handedly wipe out an army of twenty thousand men emerges, even if he shows signs of peace, the humans would still not believe him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These words come from Gazel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze and Youmu ponder out loud and expressed their agreements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since even the ones close to me have made such reaction, I am sure that those who don&rsquo;t know me would just make the same reaction described by Gazel. If I don&rsquo;t handle it well, I may become an enemy of the western nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, if we blame the disappearance of the army onto the &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo;, people would be much likely to accept it. Since the &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo; has already been deemed as a &lsquo;Catastrophe&rsquo; (&#22825;&#28797; Tensai) &ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone understands once Gazel made such conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Except for Veldora who seemed to have got the wrong idea, he begins to say delightfully: &ldquo;Gahahaha, this man has good eyes (man of culture) to have called me a genius (&#22825;&#25165; Tensai)&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree to that change too. My daughter slipped off and said that she helped Rimuru-sama become a Demon Lord. Rather than suffer the hatred and fear of men, we should change it so Rimuru-sama became a Demon Lord to create an opportunity to negotiate with the &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo; and allow the people to celebrate the emergence of a new power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no need to balance that now, is there? Elalude finishes his words with a small smile. He stares down viciously at the surrounding crowd to see if anyone dares to oppose the proposition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This man would do anything for his daughter Elen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Daddy&hellip; As expected from the sly and cunning nobleman, so cunning&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elen expresses her opinions that seem to be both praise and criticism&hellip; Anyhow, I feel pity for Elalude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room fell quiet again before we continue our explanation:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Additionally, it would benefit me in other ways as well. It is, of course, important to avoid causing panic among the humans, but it may also mislead the Demon Lords who have been </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">on guard against me that the only threat here is Veldora.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that way, my operations would no longer be restrained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I achieved complete victory against Farmus Kingdom, Demon Lord Clayman must have raised high alert against me. Once I&rsquo;ve released the news that states all of those things were works of Veldora, Clayman&rsquo;s guard against me would definitely lower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel also hopes to build the image of my nation as a friendly kingdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I, on the other hand, wish to give a good impression to the Western Nations. In addition, I hope to lower the guard of whoever stands to antagonize us by letting them underestimate our abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now our conclusion is to have others, rather than raise their guard, it&rsquo;s better to make them look down on me. It will only work in our favor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Moreover, once we&rsquo;ve released the rumor that we&rsquo;ve established ties with Veldora, the number of counties who would dare mess with us would also decrease. Even if the Western Saints Church came out to say something about it, the other countries would unlikely to follow through their order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is probably the biggest benefit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I don&rsquo;t accept Gazel&rsquo;s proposal now, there will eventually be a day that we make public of Veldora&rsquo;s existence. Since it&rsquo;s going to happen one way or the other, we&rsquo;d rather go public with it at the best timing possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We plan to deal with Clayman next, so we wouldn&rsquo;t be stupid enough to actively make an enemy of the Western Saints Church.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would also distract our own attention if we split our forces into two, so we must avoid it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have to try to lower outsiders&rsquo; guard against me as low as possible while having them raise it high against the Tempest Federation itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the perfect draft of plan made by &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; on the basis of Gazel&rsquo;s rough sketch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel, Elalude and me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a situation that unite us three with common interests and that which can be utilized in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sasuga &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; sama, its strategizing skill also seems to have improved after evolving to an Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. That would mean you found a reasonable explanation for taking care of me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora looks all satisfied while nodding his head towards me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oi oi, this guy only seems to interpret things in terms of benefiting himself&hellip;(Hypocrisy?)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;I don&rsquo;t exactly mean that, but never mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, he&rsquo;s assisting us in this act.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Putting Veldora aside, my subordinates also give some positive responses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That makes a lot of sense. In that way, we may continue to communicate with others just like before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rigurdo nods hard and speaks as if he&rsquo;s reassured. He&#39;s very worried about the economy of the country being affected in the future, and now he looks relieved. It would seem he would be focusing on development of economy for the future of the Tempest Federation. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sasuga Rimuru-sama! That is such a unique way of thinking!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it was King Gazel who started it. I only contributed some ideas.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took Shion&rsquo;s praise lightly and responded. As long as they are willing to accept my proposal, I would be satisfied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks for the help, King Gazel. If we do things in that direction, we can start operating soon using Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s reinforcements.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia gives off her brave smile and gives her thanks to Gazel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Phobio and Alvis also agree. It seems the three Beastketeers have approved the proposal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, I see. That means we would be able to focus everything we&rsquo;ve got on Clayman. If I still can&rsquo;t win, even with all this, it would be because of my incompetence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru laughs, the future military confrontation with Clayman is supplying him with a lot of fighting spirit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What a reliable lad, hopefully he will get his stage on the battlefield soon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei and Geld also express the same sentiments of wanting to begin the attack right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hope they could wait just a little longer. As soon as we finish the meeting, you guys can go ahead and ravage the place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I respond in my heart while looking at my subordinates with an ardent look. </span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The statements for going public has been approved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now we will plan on the future policies based on the second trade meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, I mention that both the King of Farmus and the Archbishop of the Western Saints Church are in our hand. We&rsquo;ll discuss about what to do about them in the future, as well as initiating our plan to support Youmu as the new king and found a new kingdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze begins to ponder after hearing my plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He remains silent. He is compiling his thoughts in his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel is also not making a sound and he has his eyes closed. His companions, however, are in midst of an intense argument regarding the topic. But they are in a stalemate, with no one having reached a conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude won&rsquo;t say a thing either. He&rsquo;s probably calmly calculating what&rsquo;s best for Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I glance around to see everyone&rsquo;s reaction as I continue explaining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, we will release the current king to have him to compensate for the invasion of our nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that is only in name, our real goal is to lead Farmus Kingdom into civil war through the issue of compensation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the King attempts to reunite the nobles to rebel, we can take his life then. After all, he&rsquo;s the king of that country and I don&rsquo;t intend to let him go free.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he decides to pay the reparations obediently, we won&rsquo;t have to support Youmu in getting the throne. However, &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t think he would go for the compensation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It will still be very difficult to execute even if he wishes to compensate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farmus Kingdom has lost twenty thousand men&rsquo;s worth of labor. In order to restore his nation&rsquo;s power, money would be a necessity. That would require taxation from the nobles, whose greedy nobility would never give it up without a fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would probably find a bunch of excuses to try to sneak his way through the issue of reparations. By that time, Youmu would start the protest and lead an armed revolution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The King may also force the nobles to give in, but once he does that, there most definitely will be civil unrest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whoever survives a failed war would naturally be held responsible. By the time the surviving King decides that he won&rsquo;t carry out his responsibilities and forces the nobles to give in&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The King would lose his reputation completely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The issue of reparations is the key. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That way, the relationship between King and Nobles would break down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One the King loses his influence, his factions would most definitely split as well. I&rsquo;ve heard that all of King&rsquo;s heirs are underage, which makes it easy to imagine them being manipulated by the nobles. By that time, there will be a struggle for the throne.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Youmu could try to rise up during their in-fight, and the people who are tired of the politics would definitely stand by the champion&rsquo;s side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;At the end of the day, the demise of the Farmus Kingdom is inevitable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, the Tempest Federation would support the Champion Youmu, who has been on good terms with Tempest for some time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Youmu announces the founding of a new kingdom, we would send forth our acknowledgement and form an official diplomatic tie with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The nobles, who would then become the power holders, would probably unite and vote against this new rising regime. But we&rsquo;ve predicted that as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;ll retain the people who supported us from the start and exile the rest. If they intend to continue their disruption, unfortunately, we will have to &ldquo;assist&rdquo; them in disappearing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We will be the force that contains the nobles&rsquo; influence in order to prevent a direct confrontation between the two parties. During this process, we will determine who is friend, or foe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The plan is as followed&mdash;It will take some time before passing of policies that are trusted by the citizens, so Youmu&rsquo;s party should attempt to take down the opposition when their popularity is still high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It will be impossible to restore the nation in such a short term.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least two to three years are needed to buffer it out of the effects past events.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only difference being that Youmu would get to shine earlier if the King decides to take the wrong move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The outline of our plan is as such.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The time to support Youmu to the crown would have to depend on the situation. But he&rsquo;s most likely gonna become the next king.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t plan to torture the people of Farmus Kingdom. But since they&rsquo;ve let their rulers do whatever they&rsquo;ve desired, I don&rsquo;t exactly see them as innocent either. So I will weaken them to a certain extent before restoring their nation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I finish the explanation for my plan with these words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone&rsquo;s been silently pondering, while King Gazel is the first to respond.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pretty good. I don&rsquo;t object this plan. But Rimuru, it&rsquo;s another thing to have this man&mdash;Youmu&mdash; crowned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel stands up as he finishes and begins to observe Youmu more closely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What an overwhelming pressure! I could even sense that at some distance. I&rsquo;ve taken that skill head-on before, so I understand how Youmu may feel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Wuuuu!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Youmu bites his teeth hard and groans, but he continues to look back at Gazel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, he&rsquo;s got quite the spine. But what about his nature? Does he love his people, and has he prepared himself with the resolve to carry his people&rsquo;s burdens?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That line made the room quiet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, how the hell should I know? It&rsquo;s not as if I wanted to become king. But, since I&rsquo;ve been given a task from someone I trust, I won&rsquo;t be worthy to be called a man if I just turn it down!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ho?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want to come to the conclusion that I think I&rsquo;m incompetent and want to give up before even trying. Also, I&rsquo;ve got to play cool before the woman I love, so I have to give it everything I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Youmu replies without any hesitation. It sounds pretty moronic but it&rsquo;s surprisingly convincing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Baka&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myuran made a noise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That sure sounds like Youmu. Dwarf King, I would personally vouch for him. This guy may be an idiot, but he&rsquo;s not an irresponsible idiot. He will see his job to the end once he takes it. I, Grucius, swear to look over him well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beastman Grucius responds with a wry smile. Myuran also nods to him after hearing and stands by Youmu. The three stand shoulder to shoulder while facing Gazel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Is that so? Alright then. If you run into anything bad, just come find me for help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel then begins to nod his head dramatically and takes back his imposing attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems Youmu has passed Gazel&rsquo;s trial and now they&rsquo;ve got the powerful Armed Nation of Dwargon to back them up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And after that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel laughs and says: &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve encountered another interesting man&rdquo;; &ldquo;He wants to be King for his woman, hahaha&mdash;&rdquo; Elalude laughs on his stomach. What followed was &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got some balls Grucius! You dare to say those things before us? Are you betraying Karion-sama?&rdquo; as teased by Phobio to Grucius.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a rather entertaining commotion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After some laugh, Gazel begins to tell Youmu in a serious tone:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Youmu, I hope your country would produce more agricultural products. I won&rsquo;t talk too much before this turns into an interference to your national policies but hear me out. Countries like Farmus gets plenty of profit from just importing goods from Dwargon, but it has been proven to be unsustainable&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Indeed, Farmus Kingdom has very high tariffs for imported goods before retailing in order to rip off the middleman countries. These are not the ideal types of customers for Dwargon.</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nowadays there are people innovating and forming new trade routes, making Farmus less advantageous in their exploits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If things turn out like this, the country must develop new types of specialized industries in order to survive. They should avoid competing with other countries&rsquo; trade industry and instead explore the undeveloped lands near its domain in order to better coexist with other nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve heard that there is an issue with the low supply of food in Dwargon, so I understand his intent. We are in fact in the same situation, we hope to not rely on the goods from the forest, but instead import more grain from other venues.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel&rsquo;s proposal seems logical.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to request that as well. Importing grain should be an important subject of discussion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t forget to push my luck as well to get a cut out of it for myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Master, you sure are impressive&hellip; Please leave it to me! Farmus Kingdom has been developing its agriculture, so hopefully we can meet the demands from both of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now Gazel and I have a common interest. Youmu also promises us both that he will be assisting us in terms of agriculture by the time he becomes the king.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna begins to serve tea and dessert to everyone for a change of pace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We switch up the mood and continue the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Youmu is recognized and everyone has approved the plan to establishing a new nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the biggest challenge of the meeting, now we can address the rest of the meeting more casually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, I shall speak while representing the Blumund Kingdom. After hearing Gazel-sama and Rimuru-san&rsquo;s proposals, I think we may be able to assist the plan. Farmus nobles Marquis M&uuml;ller and Earl Hermann have very close ties to our nation. If we were to negotiate and convince them in joining us, won&rsquo;t it bring much convenience? When Youmu-san revolts, I plan to have them to back up the revolution.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze expresses his opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But isn&rsquo;t he just a head of the Branch? Does he really have that much authority? Fuze gives off a wry smile, seemingly sensing my doubts and explain:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve said, I am the representative of Blumund Kingdom. So please consider me as an appointed personnel by the nation. Those speech I just made was not delivered as the head of the Freedom Association branch, but as a civil servant of Blumund.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After getting to know more, I found out that the Blumund Kingdom has already left a seat in the intelligences department for Fuze. Not just as a simple intelligence personnel, but an assistant to the allocation and deployment of all the intelligence units.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even if that&rsquo;s the case, the important decision you just casually made&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was going to speak up my mind, but instead Fuze explained some unexpected facts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we were doing the secret meeting, he has already reported back directly to the King of Blumund and requested a letter of appointment with complete authority over the issue. Smaller countries are able to issue those fast, and Fuze is a trustworthy guy to many.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to himself, he knows several secrets that would ruin the Blumund Kingdom if leaked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How about I just threaten this guy and take these intelligence&hellip; I&rsquo;d better not mention the thought that just popped into my head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze seems to be able to actively utilize his circumstances and collect all sorts of information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has extracted all possible information before we had announced any of our plans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This man is very smart and extremely capable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for having Marquis M&uuml;ller and Earl Hermann, they seem to be backed by the King of Blumund.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marquis M&uuml;ller is a prominent noble from Farmus Kingdom, and while he seems distant from the King of Blumund, the two are very close in terms of their private friendship. In fact, he is the distant relative of the King of Blumund. The two have very good relationship. Earl Hermann is in great debt to Marquis M&uuml;ller, so it is unlikely for Earl Hermann to betray him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi oi, is it okay to break this type of news?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahah, no problem. Even if I don&rsquo;t, Gazel-tonosama already knows as well. The secret service of Armed Nation Dwargon could easily rival the Blumund Ministry of Intelligences.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least they would be able to keep track of intelligences from neighboring countries&mdash;That&rsquo;s what Fuze said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel didn&rsquo;t give much reaction, but he did give off a wink, however. The one reacting is not Gazel, but the beauty behind him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s the head of the secret service Anrietta. She&rsquo;s a powerhouse that even Souei would approve of, so she&rsquo;s indeed got a few tricks up her sleeve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, you are being too modest. Blumund Kingdom is very good in intelligence collection. Your country specializes in the trade of intelligences, and as a vital constituent, the Ministry of Intelligences must have more capable men than us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But no matter how it seems, that doesn&rsquo;t look at what her face is trying to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anrietta is being polite.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haha, that&rsquo;s sharp. Our combat capabilities are far from your secret agents. But we are no small fries if we are talking about intelligence gathering alone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze wouldn&rsquo;t back down easily either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Blumund is a small nation, it tries its best to collect intelligence on all the nations. These are the most favorable weapons to protect their own nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since according to what Fuze said, the intelligence can&rsquo;t be fake. We shall pull those two guys into our camp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Youmu, did you catch all that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yep, leave the rest to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Youmu&rsquo;s packaging plan is thus complete.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would put on a magnificent show as a champion returning home with glory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The details of the matter couldn&rsquo;t be decided within the time of the meeting, so I&rsquo;ll leave the rest of the matter to Youmu. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moving on to the next topic.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right! So we will do that with hero Youmu&rsquo;s kingdom occupation plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that said, everyone nods in agreement. Youmu alone is trying to hide his face in embarrassment, but I&rsquo;ll just pretend to have seen nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being settled, the next topic would be&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we are just about to enter the next topic of discussion, Elalude who&rsquo;s been listening to our conversation begins to laugh hysterically. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fu-FUHAHAHAHA! Interesting! You guys are so straightforward. All these people with their national interests on the line gather around here, yet they speak so openly, without any suspicion&hellip; It would seem that I&rsquo;ve been looking like a fool for having kept my guards up all the way through.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He laughed and says, &ldquo;How stupid am I?&rdquo;, yet his eyes are giving off sharp glows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s not the dumb dad Elalude, but the real-deal nobleman. The one that can&rsquo;t speak his heart in front of others, Grand Duke of Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He suddenly changes his attitudes and caused immense stress to the crowds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Switching his mood like flipping pages of a book and it caused everyone to quiet down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude seems to want to say something, and everyone also eagerly awaits his words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;The wide meeting room fell in silent with only the noise of pages turning from Veldora reading his manga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eh, Oi! What are you doing, mister? I didn&rsquo;t give it to you, so where did you get it from&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;Never mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought that he wouldn&rsquo;t comply in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as he agrees to remain quiet, I&rsquo;m fine with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora helped me to relieve some of my nervousness, so now I just need to wait for Elalude&rsquo;s speech with a more relaxed mood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude clears his throat to get everyone&rsquo;s attention back onto him and begins to speak very seriously. This man sure becomes braver the more frustrated he gets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to ask a question. You there, Fuze right? Rimuru is a monster, do you really trust him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&hellip;do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with this whole ordeal of monsters founding a country by themselves, shouldn&rsquo;t they at least get an official recognition? Besides, shouldn&rsquo;t you refrain from forming diplomatic ties with them? Considering your position, you should have been much more careful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehhh, about that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude&rsquo;s intent isn&rsquo;t to point out his flaws, but it&rsquo;s simply asking questions. In that way, Fuze became speechless, not knowing how to answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words, my dear friend here, if I am you, I would only trade with them, meanwhile observe the reaction from the Western Saints Church. I&rsquo;ll also inform the church secretly to supply them with full authority to run an investigation on the nature of this country. I would enjoy the benefits of it and try to avoid future conflicts. Never would I stand up for them. Isn&rsquo;t that how a small country should operate diplomatically?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude&rsquo;s words are sharper than swords, and it hit home with Fuze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from that, not only Elalude, Fuze finds that everyone else is staring at him too. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damnit, why do you have to pick me&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He mumbled to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterward&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, I get it! If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll just be open with you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With some resolve, Fuze scratches his head and shouts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s become the usual arrogant Fuze. He&rsquo;s not even speaking like a politician even if the opponent is Grand Duke Elalude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Duke Elalude, I hold the same view as you. I&rsquo;ve also tried to persuade my superiors, as well as the nobles I know, but they all rejected that&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, he begins to explain his exchange with his superiors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what Fuze said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It sounds like what he told his superior is about the same as what Elalude just said, but the other side responded: &ldquo;What would happen if there is a war between Blumund Kingdom and Tempest Federation?&rdquo;, then rejected his opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This happened before I visited Blumund Kingdom, around the time we finished the battle against Charybdis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With several Greater Majins&rsquo; aid, our country was able to defeat the Orc Lord and Charybdis. The superior believed that if they were to fight a country like this, their demise would be imminent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Blumund Kingdom doesn&rsquo;t believe in the Ruminas sect, so the Western Saints Church won&rsquo;t possibly come in the aid of them. In other words, if the relationship is not handled carefully, their country may be destroyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In conclusion, there is no use trying to resist us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alright, then what&rsquo;s next?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We must obtain the trust of the monsters. We need build up a trusting relationship and have common interests and merits. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ll do whatever we can to assist them&mdash;this was the conclusion of my nation&rsquo;s higher-ups. Since both your country and Dwargon are powerful nations, there is no room for choice&hellip; If my country is to make one misstep, it may be our end. We gambled our future by not begging for help from the Western Saints Church since we have faith in the Monster leader. That is how it is in general.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze sighs while saying so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man is really pitiful, having his inner thoughts being exposed by others. It is like saying Blumund is such a weak country that it doesn&rsquo;t have the right to choose in circumstance such as this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that is a reality to be honest&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether it is good or bad, right or wrong&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn&rsquo;t matter. They made their grand gambit to bet on everything by choosing to trust me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;No, that&rsquo;s not right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Blumund Kingdom came to this conclusion, and there is no other way to go once they miscalculated and caused their kingdom&rsquo;s destruction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon pondering on it, it&rsquo;s only natural that I&rsquo;m considered a threat by people since I took care of a large army just by myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s better off allying with me than to antagonize me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perfectly reasonable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The small nation holds information and lives under the shadow of big nations That is the strategy they use.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why they believed it was the right choice and went on with all they had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s really reckless, but it might be an effective policy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Very effective to me at least.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because I now believe that Blumund Kingdom can be trusted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude seemed to have reached the same conclusion as me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;By the way, your resolve is indeed quite firm. Just another thing, you seemed to have come here in Rimuru&rsquo;s aid. Is that also your superior&rsquo;s command?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are right. He ordered me to follow through the promise of the security pact. But, even if my nation decides to break the promise one-sidedly, I would still come anyway. That&rsquo;s because I am also a member of the Freedom Association. As part of the Association, I do not belong to any country, yet I ended up becoming the head of branch at such as place. It&rsquo;s honestly quite funny. Anyway, Blumund Kingdom has left its seat in the intelligence department for me, so I guess my luck is running out&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">Why did I take on this mess</span><span class="c1">&mdash;Fuze starts to complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You are way too honest, but that reminder is too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The King of Blumund seems to be more reasonable than I expected. He even followed through with the pact to stand with us against Farmus Kingdom&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought that the pact has no benefit for us, but it&rsquo;s quite an honor to have witnessed such generosity from them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrying out the promise of a pact should be common knowledge for socializing, and it should be the same for countries breaking of promise&mdash;Just like how people who can&rsquo;t follow through with a promise cannot be trusted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This event happens to prove that Blumund Kingdom is worthy of trusting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They seemed to have believed in our side&rsquo;s victory and betted the nation&rsquo;s prospect on us. But-&mdash;They probably didn&rsquo;t expect I would eliminate all the enemies single-handedly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a gambler, could the superior you mentioned be referring to this person?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Indeed. It is the King, his majesty of our nation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked while Fuze nodded in response, looking rather awkward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a matter of fact, their king may seem like a yes man, but he&rsquo;s instead a tough guy in his heart, through and through. Those are the decisions you have to force yourself to make as a king of a nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;That is rough how the story went, we did make the right choice. We didn&rsquo;t expect Rimuru-sama to have wiped out the Farmus army alone. In addition, with the revival of &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo;, our confidence in you is no longer relevant. Because of that, the speed of approval from my superior for my letter of appointment has broken the record&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze says so looking exhausted. After all, he&rsquo;s been forced to decide on the fate of his nation, so I suppose we&rsquo;ll let him complain a bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I see, so that&rsquo;s how things went. I apologize, Fuze-san. But thanks to you, I got to get in the mind of the King of Blumund.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude took a step back and apologize to Fuze with his head lowered while saying so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Elalude doing so, Gazel speaks up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are still as cunning as ever, Elalude. You don&rsquo;t have to go to that extent to probe other nations. Shouldn&#39;t you be alright knowing that I alone have faith in Rimuru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are right, but Gazel, it&rsquo;s no easy decision to make when it comes to creating diplomatic ties with a country full of monsters. But now, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of respect for the King of Blumund.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, drop the act. You guys have already made the decision before they sent you out, right? So, what&rsquo;s your conclusion, counselor Elalude?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel&rsquo;s comeback is rather imposing, but Elalude simply went through it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not due to Elalude having no concern for personal safety for his homunculus body, but because Elalude is bold enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose. But I&rsquo;ve also come to my own conclusion. Before I would answer, could I ask another question?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time Elalude directed the question to me&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on, Dad! Stop beating around the bush and answer!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on, missy! You shouldn&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Duke-sama wants to play cool before his daughter. He&rsquo;s trying you know!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now the nervous atmosphere is completely thrown out of the window by the Elen trio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The image of the wise counselor is completely decimated&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s how Gazel describes it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I feel a bit pity for Elalude, so I decide to be a little more serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Meaning&mdash;Releasing my &ldquo;Demon Lord Haki&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Go ahead and ask, Elalude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My subordinates started a commotion seeing this with sounds like &ldquo;OHOH!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel and his companions instead are surprised at the sight and begin to groan with sounds like &ldquo;Wuu!&rdquo;. Moreover, Youmu&rsquo;s party, Fuze and even the three Beastketeers begin to have cold sweat, surprised at the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve suppressed its intensity to the lowest level, yet it is still surprisingly effective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s because &ldquo;Demon Lord Haki&rdquo; has many other skills woven in it, such as &ldquo;Menace&rdquo; and &ldquo;Magic Aura&rdquo;. It can be used as an attack, so misusing would lead to public hazards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, I believe my acting skill as a king has improved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remaining emotionless while talking is my secret technique.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hiding my emotion and talking lightly alone would intimidate my opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition with Shizu-san&rsquo;s beautiful appearance and my shining cells of slime, I give off a rather mysterious aura.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And along with &ldquo;Demon Lord Haki&rdquo;, it is almost perfect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No need to show anymore. In fact, as soon as I show any emotions from my real self, the mysterious style would be downgraded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is probably a standard for me who was once human to uphold such a manner in doing things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that, Elalude also got tricked by me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Ehh, impressive. So&mdash;Demon Lord Rimuru, I shall ask you. As a Demon Lord, how do you plan to use your power?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eh, so it is about this after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Simple question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wish to create a new world according to my heart and allow everyone to have a meaningful life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I could, I wish to create a prosperous world where people&rsquo;s days are filled with joyful laughter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I truly hope so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I express my true feeling to Elalude without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;That&rsquo;s about it. But no way things would always be so smooth-sailing, facing failure would be inevitable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Th-that type of spectacle utopia, do you really wish to make it a reality?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, he really got spooked by it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A prominent nobleman who doesn&rsquo;t show emotion, now I&rsquo;ve got him panicked,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, this power is gained for that purpose. There is no use talking about ideals when you don&rsquo;t have power, and won&rsquo;t you feel empty to only have power but no ideal? I&rsquo;m a rather greedy individual, but I&rsquo;m not interested in something along the line of a one-way pursuit of power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I tried to paraphrase some quotes I remembered before and used them as my message.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, shouldn&rsquo;t it be natural to think this way?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You work hard when you have a goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s human nature, to my understanding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ha, hahaha, HAHAHAHA! Nice, very nice, Demon Lord Rimuru! What a greedy Demon Lord! Now I finally understand why you&rsquo;ve awakened!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude begins to laugh out loud. I waited until he finished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After he finishes laughing, Elalude kneels before me as a messenger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Many apologies if I offended you. Demon Lord Rimuru, I, as the messenger of Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion, wish to form a diplomatic tie with your nation&mdash;the Jura-Tempest Federation. Do grant me the honor&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The scene falls silent once more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Except for noise of book flipping.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll lose if I care. If I turn my head around now it may ruin the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Certain loser of a man (Veldora) is lying down on the resting bench, drinking some iced red tea that god know when he requested while reading his bible (manga). It will only ruin my pace to have him in my sight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I wish to build a friendly relation with you as well. Do form a diplomatic tie with us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">WOOHOO&mdash;! There is a lot celebration at the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone gets up from their seat to celebrate this newfound relationship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there is a new nation that is willing to accept us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The third human country&mdash;Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion, has formed an official diplomatic tie with us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fall of Farmus kingdom is imminent, and new a new country shall rise under Youmu&rsquo;s leadership.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The map of this continent shall be reprinted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But things would escalate sooner than I expected.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="id.1t3h5sf"></a><h2 class="c15" id="h.4d34og8"><span class="c6 c2">Chapter 2</span></h2><p class="c19"><span class="c2 c7">A message from Ramiris</span></p><hr><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Near the end of the meeting, I was about to wrap everything up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When suddenly, there was a &ldquo;PONG!&rdquo; sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The door was flung open by an intruder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Afterwards&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heed my words!

How I respond to this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris flies straight towards me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The door is wide open and Beretta, who followed her, carefully closes it on the way in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I feel like he must have a lot on his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, it&rsquo;s probably very tiring for him. I could almost see the way he gets toyed around by Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just in front of Ramiris, a person wearing a classy butler suit stops her. It&rsquo;s Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s been quietly observing the conference and awaiting orders behind me. Looks like he won&rsquo;t allow the intruder to just do whatever she wants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How should I put it, Ramiris is immediately apprehended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like a dragonfly being squeezed by someone&rsquo;s hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She struggles while flapping her wings and shouts: &ldquo;Wa-wait a second? What are you doing&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What an interesting fairy. It&rsquo;s very funny seeing her prestige as a Demon Lord being completely tarnished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, I&rsquo;ve caught the suspicious intruder. What should I do with her? She&rsquo;s been spouting nonsense about the destruction of our town, what do you wish for me to do with her?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo returns before me and inquires with much respect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I instead look at Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s struggling frantically trying to escape from Diablo&rsquo;s grip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;EHHH&mdash;! Why? I can&rsquo;t escape with even all of my magic? A-are you some big shot as well? AHH, why are you doing this!? I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This fairy is still as noisy as ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But to be honest, Diablo does possess magicules rivaling those of Ramiris, so escaping his grip should be pretty hard for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet she is somehow still a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If anyone thinks that Demon Lords are not all that strong then it would all be entirely thanks to this fairy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, do you know this fairy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze asks me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, the meeting got interrupted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only thing left for us to do is to confirm the procedures (of the previous plan)&hellip; I really wish this bugger could have just arrived a little later&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that&rsquo;d be equally as stupid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a fairy called Ramiris and an old friend. Despite her appearance, she&rsquo;s still actually a Demon Lord!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi! What&rsquo;s with that attitude? Don&rsquo;t judge me based on my appearance, I am known as the most terrifying and one of the strongest among the Ten Great Demon Lords!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris still puffs out her chest proudly despite Diablo&rsquo;s restraint, and with a smug look too. She hasn&rsquo;t realized herself that there is no prestige to how she looks at all right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh? Demon Lord&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah! This thing is what now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And words along those lines could be heard from the surrounding members of the meeting. The participants don&rsquo;t seem to be surprised about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Hmm? Eheheh&mdash;? Why? You guys should act more surprised! I am a Demon Lord you know! I am &lsquo;Fairy of the Labyrinth&rsquo;, you know? Why is everyone so calm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No no no, even though you claim to be a demon lord, you are currently being restrained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I guess, everyone is probably baffled right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I considered them kind for not voicing such thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No actually&hellip;Since Rimuru-sama is a Demon Lord as well, it&rsquo;s reasonable to expect him to know other Demon Lords&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Or perhaps I&rsquo;ve gotten over the shock of the &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo;s revival, so I&rsquo;m kinda numb to these things now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">People started talking and nodding to each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see, it makes more sense with the way they said it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And looking back to Ramiris, she seems rather annoyed by everyone&rsquo;s reaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo;&hellip; You mean, has Veldora revived? Ha, you&rsquo;ve all been tricked! I&rsquo;ve blown away Veldora with one punch! That guy isn&rsquo;t even worth mentioning. Anyway, his reign should have ended already. So if you&rsquo;re all afraid of him, you should start worshipping me from now on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She begins to laugh loudly as she went on a tangent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Please stop making a fool of yourself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I, taking Ramiris from Diablo, bought her over to Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, Veldora, could you spend some time with this kid? She&rsquo;s a Demon Lord after all, so maybe the two of you could be friends?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? I&rsquo;m busy solving a big mystery here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora doesn&rsquo;t want the be troubled and planned to turn me down. But I won&rsquo;t compromise like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, about that, the criminal is XXXX.</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Alright, mystery solved? I&rsquo;ll leave the rest to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I ruthlessly revealed the criminal&rsquo;s identity and go back to my seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora opens his eyes wide like he&rsquo;s been deeply traumatized. His eyes seemed to carry the message &ldquo;Ehhhhh? Spoiler alert??&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a bit mean of me to do that, but we are in a meeting here. Also I meant that for him to reflect on himself, so I couldn&rsquo;t let the opportunity go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As far as Ramiris goes, she has since fainted upon seeing Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, the two maladjusted children have settled down, so I used the chance to restart the meeting.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, I need to confirm some unattended business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru, the enemy is Clayman. We will crush him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for that order&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru shows an unrestrained smile and gives off a devious glow from his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only the kijins, all of my subordinates look very delighted. Unknowingly, everyone has become warmongers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of which, everyone currently in attendance was all part of this whole mess (Farmus battle) last time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never mind, high morale is a good thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then Regarding the Beastketeers and the Beastmen soldiers&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No need to continue. We will obey every order by Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Same here&mdash;Alvis also flashes a devious and charming smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Same for Phobio and Suphia, so there&rsquo;s no need for more words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru, do you stand a winning chance with just these people?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We are gonna win this. That guy has really pissed me off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, I&rsquo;ll trust you then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel flashes a worried smile as he muttered with a lowered voice: &ldquo;You are supposed to be my junior, yet you&rsquo;ve grown so fast&hellip;&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t think anyone besides me heard that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But this Clayman, he&rsquo;s no Demon Lord you can afford to underestimate! It&rsquo;s said that he has many Majins under his rule, and it&rsquo;s rumored that he even has connections with the Eastern Empire&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude cautiously adds, however&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. War is not about quantity, but quality.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I proudly express my (unexpected) opinion and shut him up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, I think I can hear the sound of my common sense collapsing in my head&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though Elalude responds in shock, he still looks rather interested in our power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even I feel my statement&rsquo;s rather illogical but I&rsquo;m definitely right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Generally in war, the larger the size of the army, the more of an advantage said army will have, but this does not work in this world. The battle against the Orc Lord would be a good example. As soon as we took down the enemy generals, the battle was essentially concluded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Additionally, our numbers are looking quite compelling this time around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei has gone to investigate Clayman&rsquo;s movements. And since the meeting will be going on for some time, I decide to hear his report first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s still investigating their specific number currently. As of right now they are known to be staying in Milim&rsquo;s territory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei&rsquo;s &ldquo;Clone&rdquo; should be returning anytime now, so I&rsquo;ll be able to make a judgement about that soon. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s still more to discuss regarding our war tactics. But first I need to confirm our plans for Farmus Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After releasing the King, we would be looking for Marquis M&uuml;ller and Earl Hermann to hold the king responsible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;ll see how they react and then eventually have Youmu start the revolution, however&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, the issue with the war is our problem. So I hope you all can have faith in us to handle this matter. I hope everyone would be willing to lend a helping hand by the time Youmu becomes the King of the new age.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, the guests all nod in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d rather have them handle the issues with human society, that would probably eliminate a lot of mistakes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I do hope that they will help us with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;First off, Fuze-kun, please help us contact Marquis M&uuml;ller and Earl Hermann in secret.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, leave it to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze confidently accepted my request.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;ll discuss more about the moderation of the plan on another day, but right now we&rsquo;ve finished outlining the plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;ll pretend that Youmu has rescued the King and have Marquis M&uuml;ller take the King in under his protection so he can act as Youmu&rsquo;s back-up. We will release the three prisoners at a later point in time, which means&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, Shion, are the interrogations of the three captives going well? Have they revealed any useful information?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since she can do whatever she wants to these people, I&rsquo;ve sorta forgotten about them after leaving them in Shion&rsquo;s care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, of course, Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh ho, Shion&rsquo;s quite confident.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve got an itchy dangerous feeling from her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Youmu and Myuran also accompanied the investigation, I shifted my gaze towards them both, but they seem like they are avoiding my eyes out of embarrassment. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still averting my gaze, they begin their report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;About that, Master. Investigation? Interrogation? Basically, the captives did reveal some information.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, they did&hellip; But that wasn&rsquo;t really an investigation, and calling it an interrogation is even further from the truth&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You guys can stop here now. I really don&rsquo;t want to hear the rest of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion must have outdone herself. But since it was me who appointed her to the job, I shouldn&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t plan on being the one complaining about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Either way, they wouldn&rsquo;t have any way of stopping the deranged Shion anyway. Since I was in the cave that whole time, it didn&rsquo;t seem like they&rsquo;d be able to contact me either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If someone were to be held responsible, I should be the one as I failed to find the right person for the job. In other words, let&rsquo;s pretend I never found out about this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sorry, my friends from Farmus, but after all, it&rsquo;s you guys who are at fault for making the first move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hope you will all understand that just surviving in and of itself is quite lucky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I took the three captives alive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Shion&rsquo;s interrogation&mdash;I mean investigation (torture), they&rsquo;ve revealed plenty of information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;First off, we have Ed&hellip;Ednew? Eddie?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t it King Edmalis?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Shion&rsquo;s struggle, Shuna whispers into Shion&rsquo;s ear and gave her the answer she was struggling to come up with. How reliable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conversely, is Shion really okay? it seems like she&rsquo;s incapable of even remembering the name of a King&hellip; Well, his name is pretty weird so, whatever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It would seem that some Merchants had approached King Edmalis in the past and presented the silk product from our country. That led the King to act on his greed. Apart from that, they were afraid that our nation would become an important trading hub in the future, which is what led to the incident this time&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion continues to explain her findings which are all inline my prediction. If we have to get specific here, I would have suspected that this merchant instigated Edmalis into committing these treacheries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you find out the identity of this merchant? Could he be an appointed merchant?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that&hellip; I&rsquo;m very sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion looks dejected like a leaking balloon. I immediately began to comfort her. That was just a question I happen to think up, so it&rsquo;s not really that important to me honestly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t really matter, what about the Church?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided to pursue a different topic; let&rsquo;s see what type of information Archbishop Rayhiem has.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes! I&rsquo;ve obtained information about the mastermind. His name is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;She has forgotten again&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;The mastermind was Nicolas Spertus.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon receiving Shion&rsquo;s desperate gaze, Myuran announces the name in her stead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion&rsquo;s interrogation was going rather well at first, yet it got derailed near the end. She&rsquo;s not very good at memorizing jargon. Next time I should avoid having her doing these types of jobs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thankfully Myuran is here to save the day. Not even Youmu is as reliable as her. What a truly competent assistant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apparently, our nation is an enemy to their god, hence they plan on deploying their army&mdash;It is said that this was Nicolas&rsquo; stance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Plan on deploying their army&mdash;That means they are still in the planning phase.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. So Archbishop Rayhiem decided to preemptively attack the enemy of god in order to take the glory and receive commemoration from their headquarters.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze mumbles his realization, and everyone seems to agree with his conclusion as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyhow, there&rsquo;s still some room for diplomacy. The Western Saints Church hasn&rsquo;t made its final decision yet. If that&rsquo;s the case, we may be able to avoid the confrontation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, allow me to negotiate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze decides to volunteer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wants to drag the Council States down into this as well with the goal of prompting the Council States to announce the Jura-Tempest Federation as a nation and advocate that they should stand together against the Western Saints Church.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Through promotion of the Western Council States, Tempest Federation would begin to gain recognition around the world and become a new hub for trading.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only problem is that all of the residents are monsters. However, they are able to speak the human language and treat everyone kindly. With that alone we should be able to blend in with the humans. In fact that has already been proven here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or rather, their evolutions are very unexpected. To be frank, the goal is to have the humans treat our monsters as demi-human like they do with Dwarves or Elves who are similar to humans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to support Fuze&rsquo;s plan, King Gazel would also take action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would actively increase the trading activities with our nation to raise the reputation of Tempest Federation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doctrines of the Western Saints Church strictly states that monsters are the enemies of humans, so they would likely find it hard to accept us. However, both the Armed Nation of Dwargon and Blumund Kingdom have already formed diplomatic ties with the Tempest Federation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if the Western Saints Church executed on their authority, it can&rsquo;t wipe away these layered relationships. Furthermore, a kingdom of monsters having a friendly relationship with human countries would most definitely draw the interest of other countries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And during this time, the Sorcery Dynasty of Sarion suddenly announces formal diplomatic ties with Tempest Federation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We will use this to continue our pursuit for success.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather disrespectful for me to say this but forming ties with Tempest Federation is a double-edged sword. As such those who do should act cautiously if they don&rsquo;t want to be bitten back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no doubt that this is uttered by Fuze. He is right, Blumund kingdom has the most difficult stance among them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Armed Nation of Dwargon and Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion both are uninfluenced by the Western Saints Church and have the power to potentially rival the Western Nations by themselves. In comparison, the Blumund Kingdom is a small kingdom that can be greatly swayed by the pressures exerted by its neighboring countries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;But those are topics for another day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehe, you are Fuze right? Don&rsquo;t worry, through Tempest Federation, your country can communicate with us, Dwargon. As long as we back up your nation&rsquo;s stance, the Council States won&rsquo;t underestimate you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel is right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Armed Nation of Dwargon and Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion both have very different cultural backgrounds and technologies. The addition of trade with Tempest would spur this town towards quicker development. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A new era of culture would soon be upon us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, the Magic-fueled Science Sarion is so proud of and the Spirit Industrialization developed by Dwargon are two different branches of technology. Combining the two will no doubt create a fantasy like industrial revolution. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Blumund Kingdom gets to taste the cherry on top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The potential profit compared to the losses definitely won&rsquo;t be small.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for the changes of the Farmus Kingdom to come at Youmu&rsquo;s hands, it can become an agricultural nation. We can satisfy our region&rsquo;s hunger and inspire a new food culture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to prevent competition with each nations&rsquo; specialties, we must share our opportunities for profits properly&mdash;In regard to that I&rsquo;ve been planning something behind the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ultimate Skill &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; has the processing power to easily outperform a quantum computer. It is more economical and precise than the supercomputer &ldquo;World Simulator&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c1">, so it&rsquo;s a piece of cake to compute complex calculations with precision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I feel like a member of the Illuminati, manipulating the events of the world&hellip; But it&rsquo;s okay since I am a Demon Lord after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I also understand where Fuze&rsquo;s worry is coming from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Blumund Kingdom is small and is afraid of being exploited by bigger countries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To break off from the States&rsquo; Council which recognizes the rights of smaller counties is a difficult decision. This is the source of Fuze&rsquo;s concern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No wonder why he would feel anxious about the plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, there may even be short-term benefits in continuing their interactions with the Council. If all of the intelligence forces from Blumund are utilized, it may not even be a problem to catalyze a total war between the Western Saints Church and us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I had caused them to contact the Church from the moment we met, we might have already suffered a crusade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the people of Blumund didn&rsquo;t choose that path.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They instead chose to believe me and fight alongside us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This so-called result was the product of their free will after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Blumund Kingdom has chosen to align with us, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be wrong of me to give them some advice in return.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;After all, coexistence is my dream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fuze, could you help me convey a message to the King of Blumund. I have something that requires his assistance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Assistance? Is it something troublesome again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rude much! It would take too long to explain it now, in addition it&rsquo;s something hard to comprehend, so I plan on explaining it directly to him myself next time I visit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you the rude one Rimuru-sama! Are you suggesting that my head isn&rsquo;t good enough?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t mean that. Do you happen to be an expert of economics?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehhhhh&hellip; Alright. I&rsquo;ll deliver the message to the King and arrange for your meeting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, I responded with a nod, ending the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The mission of Blumund Kingdom is to grasp the quantity of transactions in trades. To investigate the exports and imports of each country and deliver the right goods to the right place. In short, they will become the first trading company to be established in this world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If this operation is successful, the small country would no longer be small. It would gather immense influence and give birth to the concept of international industries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hope it would one day become a trading hub given its geographical location.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the details will have to wait for before our attack plan is settled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We need to take down Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Youmu needs to build up a new kingdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Fuze and the Blumund Kingdom, they will utilize their expertise in intelligence gathering and manipulation to stall the advances of the Western Council and the Western Saints Church, at least &lsquo;til our side has achieved victory in the upcoming war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To us, the Western Saints Church is a huge threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though they may not take any immediate action, stalling them is still necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Western Saints Church will not recognize a kingdom of monsters, and neither will the Holy Empire Ruberios.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I want to try my best in reducing and delaying possible conflicts and prove to the outside world that we are able to help everyone and coexist with humans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it ever comes to a war, I hope I would be able to settle things peacefully, but&hellip; judging from Hinata&rsquo;s reaction, it won&rsquo;t be easy&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">None of the problems have a simple solution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything will depend on our actions from here on out.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the next thing on our list, let&rsquo;s have the three captives&mdash;Hmm?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have King Edmalis, Archbishop Rayhiem, and who&rsquo;s the other guy?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh yeah! It&rsquo;s the one I didn&rsquo;t beat to death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is it really okay to let these kinds of people walk free again?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shion, aren&rsquo;t there three captives in total? The one who survived my attack, has he been a nuisance to you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh? Ah, yes. You mean the man who&rsquo;s still in shock, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still in shock? I see he&rsquo;s barely surviving as well. So he wasn&rsquo;t a big deal then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, you are talking about that man who survived. It sounds like Knight Commander Folgen. Is he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel seems to have heard of this guy, does that mean he&rsquo;s considered a strong general? Hmm&mdash;If that&rsquo;s the case, wouldn&#39;t it be dangerous to release him like this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I turn to Diablo and ask:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you think of him? Shouldn&rsquo;t he be quite strong? Is it okay to let him go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Diablo responds with a carefree smile still on his face no less.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, Rimuru-sama. He&rsquo;s just a nobody (to me). However, in terms of human standards, he seems to be quite talented in conjuring magic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A mage? If that&rsquo;s the case, it can&rsquo;t be the Knight Commander named Folgen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shion, do you know his name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion responds naturally as I ask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes! His name is Ramen!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, so he&rsquo;s called Ramen. Eh, speaking of which, I haven&rsquo;t eaten ramen for years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The instant ramen I ate during night shifts tasted really good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The nostalgia&mdash; I should try recreating it next time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I begin to recall things from my previous life&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ramen? Is there someone called that in Farmus?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t ring a bell. And a magician? Magic? Speaking of magic, there&rsquo;s a Majin called Larzen from Farmus&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Hero Larzen? That man is quite the character.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze, Elalude, and Gazel claim so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not only them though,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hero Larzen&hellip; I&rsquo;ve heard of him. His name is known even to the Beast Kingdom. That man is the guardian of the great Farmus Kingdom, so called &lsquo;The Wise Mage&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about it too. He is a human, but his magical ability could easily surpass any mage. I&rsquo;ve wanted to have a fight with him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But we will probably have the upper hand in close quarter combat. Nonetheless, this human cannot be underestimated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a surprise that even the Beastketeers know him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t imagine someone like that would stay in Farmus Kingdom&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man called Ramen isn&rsquo;t important, but instead we should be cautious about this Larzen guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shion, are you sure that guy is called Ramen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, lemme think, probably yeah&hellip; But, he&rsquo;s super young! He&rsquo;s one of the people who attacked the town, and definitely not the magician everyone is talking about!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She did not sound sure about the first part but seems very certain about the second half.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eh, but isn&rsquo;t this a bit strange?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo also mentioned that he&rsquo;s a mage&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It got me kind of worried, so I decide to inquire from not only Diablo and Shion, but everyone else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The one in captivity is a young man who once attacked this town. There is no doubt he is an &ldquo;Otherworld Traveler&rdquo;. It would seem it also matches up to everyone&rsquo;s testimony.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Diablo, could it be that you are lying to get praises from Rimuru-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion tries to provoke him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a surprising proposition. He&rsquo;s just some cheap shot that got beaten by me. Only an idiot would hold him in such high regard. I was simply completing my task in order to have Rimuru-sama grant me the rights to serve him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh yeah, Diablo did once say he wanted to serve me. But he didn&rsquo;t mention that his opponent was that strong, and he doesn&rsquo;t seem that bothered about it at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This would mean&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Speaking of which, about that &lsquo;Otherworld Traveler&rsquo;. When Geld and I cornered him to a desperate spot, there was a quite powerful mage who intervened. That man is indeed called Larzen. It would seem that he has come prepared with Nuclear Strike magic ready to be unleashed at any time. I thought it would have caused much damage to our side, so I decided to let him go&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou recalls and reports to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it&rsquo;s not Ramen, but Larzen?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Report. By casting a secret technique under the Spirit Magic series, one can replace one&rsquo;s body. &gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, so that is what it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, could it be that this mage called Larzen has transferred his consciousness into the young man?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion begins to panic once I point out that possibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My guess is probably right that she was uncertain about the captives&rsquo; names.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu. Whatever his name is, we should be able to find out soon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo cuts Shion off, causing tears to accumulate around her eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, that man is indeed Larzen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no Ramen guy, get it? So you can stop blaming Shion now. It can&rsquo;t be helped after all, Shion is Shion. Basically, it would be a mistake to assign any task involving brain work to Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;But, to be able to beat the crap out of that Larzen!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t believe it; he&rsquo;s been the Hero that Farmus relied on for hundreds of years&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;His power as a mage could even rival mine, and may perhaps even surpass mine, such a rare prodigy has been&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone is astonished at this revelation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The source of their astonishment is Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thinking back on it, Diablo is indeed a mysterious individual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why does he want to serve me? Although since he doesn&rsquo;t mind providing free service, I don&rsquo;t have any reason to refuse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he talks so lightly of the man that everyone thinks we should be extra cautious towards. It would seem he is really strong indeed, and that&rsquo;s before I named him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now he&rsquo;s even showing off his strength in front of Shion. But it&rsquo;s due to her own actions. That&rsquo;s why she can only gnash her teeth regretfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyway, all is well. There shouldn&rsquo;t be any problems moving forward as long as Shion hasn&rsquo;t considered Diablo to be her arch nemesis. Old butler vs Elite butler, this type of relationship is probably the breeding ground for jealousy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right, I&rsquo;ve decided!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Youmu, about the mission that initially involved you bringing the three captives, bring Diablo along too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, it&rsquo;s Diablo this time who&rsquo;s looking at me in panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although I can see Shion&rsquo;s smirk, I didn&rsquo;t give that order for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the decision I made after much thought. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are waging war against Clayman soon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora will be assigned the duty of protecting this town, and I happen to be worried about who to put in place to assist Youmu&rsquo;s party.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This individual must have a clear head and the ability to adapt to various situations. In addition, this person needs to be able to travel fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei is the most suitable candidate, but I wish to see how he performs on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru is the leading general of the army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion is a no go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou can&rsquo;t use &ldquo;Shadow Step&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dimension Transportation&rdquo;, making transportation more time-consuming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Geld and Gabiru, their appearances are too eye-catching in human society. And considering their personalities, they definitely aren&rsquo;t the most qualified strategists here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In lieu of all this, Diablo is the only person able to fulfill all these conditions. He once said he is willing to take down Farmus Kingdom himself, so he shouldn&rsquo;t be objecting to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I also want someone to watch over that troubling guy Larzen, surely Diablo should be able to handle it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be counting on you, Diablo!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I understand, Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo gives out a joy-filled smile upon accepting my request.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something&rsquo;s amiss about this, but since he&rsquo;s agreed to it, it&rsquo;s no problem. I can picture Diablo right now as the strongest here after Veldora and me. He should be able to act accordingly no matter what happens.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It might take a few years, so you&rsquo;ve got to keep your composure. Whatever happens, you can contact me whenever you wish using &ldquo;Telepathy Net&rdquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem. It won&rsquo;t take that long; I will quickly resolve the issue.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such a confident response, we&rsquo;re talking about eliminating an entire country here. But it is precisely because of that, I am able to confidently task him with this mission. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that we have one less problem to deal with. We can now fully focus on waging total war against the Demon Lord Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, our time for making confirmations for the arrangements has come to an end. So the meeting with the heads of nations is concluded for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the very end I want to confirm whether there is any other issue anyone wishes to address. And it turns out someone did raise their hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s Elalude. He looks at me as if wanting to say something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Elalude begins to speak up without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My nation Sorcerer&rsquo;s Dynasty Sarion is also quite a ways off from here&mdash;That is the Tempest Federation. There are very annoying forests and mountains in between our nations. If there were a direct path between our nations, it would greatly reduce the time spent in travelling. If we are able to open a road between us, it would be highly convenient for our exchanges&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He winks at me as he finishes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm huh&mdash;I know where he is getting at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since we&rsquo;ve established ties with the Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion, it would be much more convenient to have a direct road constructed between each other. Of course our country would undertake such construction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The benefit is being able to directly transport goods instead of taking the previously longer detour, that is why I&rsquo;ve considered it as part of my plan from the start.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the construction would require a mass-reform of the land, for instance, deforestation, digging of tunnels, as well as paving operations on the roads. It will expend a massive national budget in order to execute all of the above operations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion may be strong, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it can easily provide a budget on the scale of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude, by his careful consideration from the standpoint of a Duke, would likely push all the work on to us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Elalude, you are being really scummy here. How could Rimuru agree so easily to such a substantial request.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel decides to defend me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But hold on a second, didn&rsquo;t we take responsibility for the entire project of constructing the direct roads to Dwargon?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Surely you jest, Gazel! It&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable for Rimuru-dono to reject me, you of all people should know that you don&rsquo;t have a say in this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, so Elalude knows about that as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could we have avoided this had we rejected Gazel&rsquo;s request?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be honest, it&rsquo;s alright if we are to take full responsibility. Constructing roads is just a small investment compared to having more human recognition.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.2s8eyo1"><span class="c1">But with that being said, if I just agree to it like this, it may encourage other countries to take advantage of us in our future diplomatic relationships. Just like how I was taken advantage of during my trip by Blumund Kingdom. Humans are truly cunning creatures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I&rsquo;ve got to knock him down from his high horse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand what Duke Elalude meant. I believe is fine for us to handle the construction of the road, however&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude gulps as he looks towards me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t be so nervous, I don&rsquo;t plan on doing anything outrageous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, we would also be the ones responsible for the security and hotel business on the road. And of course, the cost of construction would eventually be transferred to the road users via a carefully considered toll.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I add.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In simpler terms, we will create a charging mechanism like those on highways. Travelers will be charged a certain fee per distance away from an alarm outpost. This will turn into long-term profits. Despite how it seems to be unprofitable in the short term, it would gradually transition to profitability as time goes on. This is the so called conscienceless national income.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Additionally, we get to do another country a favor by taking the job of constructing a road.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I understand now, that&rsquo;s a great idea. And it sounds very reasonable. But, regarding the toll you mentioned. I hope we get to renegotiate it every couple of years.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh? Elalude is not so simple-minded after all. I see that he has guessed my thoughts immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No problem, we will have to build this type of thing on the basis of consensus. There is no point in pricing the toll too high, hence I will accept his suggestion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, we should do just that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So casual!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze blurts out in surprise, but I don&rsquo;t really mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diplomacy is all about judgement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Geld! You&rsquo;ve got more work to schedule!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood! Much Obliged. We&rsquo;ve learnt much about labor coordination from all the projects we undertook so far, and some even gained the skill of supply and earth manipulation from transporting resources. Whatever work Rimuru-sama give us will be the best field for military training!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">EH! Ah, so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s how they feel about their work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I thought Geld was a sensible man, but as it turns out, he&#39;s quite the aggressive war-monger too. What a surprise. It left me speechless for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah-Okay then. If that&rsquo;s the case, we&rsquo;ve got to end the battle quickly and start working early.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. Do come around to check on the results of our daily training!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld seems very motivated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would definitely be very active during the battle against Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No other person seems to have much else to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all the twists and turns, our meeting has finally concluded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All the nations involved in the meeting have their own agendas. They exchange their views in an effort to create a world where Humans and monsters can coexist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This meeting that took place without prior scheduling&mdash;The future generations call it the Meeting of Man and Monster&mdash;it&rsquo;s considered a significant historical turning point. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;A big step forward again towards our ideal.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that the meeting with the national leaders has concluded for some time now, we can finally conduct the military meeting regarding the war against Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve had everyone be ready in the hopes that they would all listen to Souei&rsquo;s report together with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I feel as though I&rsquo;ve forgotten about something&hellip; With that thought I realize&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right, Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What was that annoying fairy actually trying to say?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Come to think of it, is she still passed out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am starting to worry about her, so I decide to see Veldora and check up on her condition&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t believe this is happening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris is over there intently focused on reading manga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And here I thought I would make her cry if I don&rsquo;t go spend some time with her. That concern is clearly unnecessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Oi, you there, what in the world are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had to ask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hush! I&rsquo;m just getting to the good part, talk to you later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris won&rsquo;t even raise her head, and instead makes this comment to try and sneak out of the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What is she doing here anyway?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Currently she&rsquo;s got all her attention on manga, but didn&rsquo;t she have something important to say?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps it went down like this&mdash;Ramiris who awakened from her coma was about to cause a scene but discovered the scattered manga on the bench. Then she was drawn to the manga so much that she immersed herself in its world, not even realizing that the meeting has ended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seems awfully similar to Veldora. It&rsquo;s almost as if her fainting was an act. The two now are so close that both are requesting services from Beretta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m speechless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I shift my gaze towards Beretta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I should congratulate you for your evolution to Demon Lord. I&rsquo;ve wanted to express my gratitude since I&rsquo;ve also evolved thanks to your evolution. With your blessing, I have evolved from &lsquo;Arc Doll&rsquo; to &lsquo;Chaos Doll&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he finishes, he bows to me respectfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta seems to have evolved into a Chaos Doll, which possess the opposing elements of Holy and Demonic at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It may have resulted because of his unique skill &ldquo;Amanojaku&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c2">(Heavenly Evil Spirit)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This skill would automatically obtain the opposite attributes for whatever attributes Beretta gains. In other words, take Beretta for instance, his birthright as Demon race can be reversed to give him powers of the Angel race as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The new &ldquo;Spirit Core&rdquo; generated in Beretta&rsquo;s body combined with the old &ldquo;Demonic Core&rdquo; ended up giving birth to &ldquo;Chaos Core&rdquo;. It is said that when he utilizes the power of this Chaos Core, Beretta could even mitigate his past weakness, the Holy elements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s just way too crafty&mdash;I believe I am not the only one with that thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With his body built from tight magisteel, most physical and magical attacks won&rsquo;t be able to harm him. And on top of that, even his weakness got patched up. This is definitely one of the strongest evolutions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Him learning the unique skill &ldquo;Amanojaku&rdquo; also seems to be related to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think it&rsquo;s probably my anxiety back then that granted him said abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I was trapped by the &ldquo;Holy Purification Barrier&rdquo;, my magicules were sealed and I felt as though I were nothing. Perhaps that sensation led him to obtain such power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Arc Doll&rdquo; operates on magicules and he knew that if he were in the same place, he would be rendered unable to move. That&rsquo;s why his evolution is a solution to that concern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether it is the unique skill &ldquo;Amanojaku&rdquo; or his &ldquo;Chaos Core&rdquo;, these are all very intriguing research materials for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Report. Unique skill &ldquo;Amanojaku&rdquo; has been compiled by ultimate skill &ldquo;Covenant King Uriel&rdquo;. This skill can now be replicated through the all-attribute-viable skill &ldquo;Law Manipulation&rdquo;. In addition, the production of &ldquo;Chaos Core&rdquo; would require the presence of the following ingredients under the conditions of&mdash;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; begins its report as if it&rsquo;s nothing again. What a genius!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh yeah, I have &ldquo;Food Chain&rdquo;!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The skill &ldquo;Food Chain&rdquo; is part of my ultimate skill &ldquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rdquo; that allows me to acquire the prototype of skills from my subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta seems to be part of that as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterward, I had a little chat with Beretta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seems rather happy, not many complaints so far.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And he was conducting all sorts of experiments in the labyrinth. He only discovered my evolution after he himself evolved during the incident.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s reassuring to hear that you&rsquo;ve been doing well. Let&rsquo;s talk more when the business at hand is resolved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haha, thank you for your care. I will be looking forward to that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, it&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;ve got the ability to accommodate Ramiris&rsquo;s whims now. Anyway, just follow her orders unless it&rsquo;s something unreasonable and things should turn out fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me. I will definitely meet your expectations!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, good luck. By the way, why did you guys come here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I ask Beretta and steal a glance towards Ramiris who&rsquo;s still buried in her manga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A-about that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta seems to recall the intent of their journey and begins approaching Ramiris in an attempt to persuade her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ramiris-sama, now is not the time for this. You should tell Rimuru-sama about that thing fast&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re super annoying! I&rsquo;m busy right now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please state the intention of your visit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-HAVE-TOLD-YOU! This is my destined encounter! In this great reading material called manga, which boy would the heroine choose&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris speaks as if she&rsquo;s justified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta sure has it hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta seems too pitiful like this, but it can&rsquo;t be helped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have a vague idea of the type of manga she is reading. With a sigh, I went over to threaten her. If I don&rsquo;t, I may have to wait until she finishes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;By the way, that manga is a forty-volume long mega piece. Even if everyone says I am as kind and tolerant as a Buddha, there are things that even I can&rsquo;t stand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi, Ramiris. If you don&rsquo;t want me to spoil who the heroine will fall in love with, state your business here immediately!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My prediction that my intimidation would work was spot on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;YES!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She springs up with both hands while trying to recall the intention of her visit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing how casual she looks, surely, she has some mundane news to report. It must have only been her own exaggerations before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other guests from different nations who were chatting and packing up in preparation to return home also seem to recall that there is this Ramiris here. They all paused their actions and probably also want to hear what she has to say before leaving.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris seems rather pleased with the situation and puffs out her flat chest. She crosses her arms and begins nodding as if she has something on her mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will say this one more time! This country is going to perish!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That line came right out of her mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-what did you say&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I respond flatly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Ramiris begins to follow up insatiably, as if she has granted me a great favor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh huh! Eh, I didn&rsquo;t want to see that happening either, that&rsquo;s why I came to inform you, so be thankful!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would probably take too long for me to deal with her seriously, so I&rsquo;d just have to casually respond.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, why will our country perish?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that, before I could tell you the reason&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris pauses and switches to a more serious expression. First, she glances around at all the important individuals from each country, and with a slight consideration she continues with a nod.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, this may still be relevant to humans. Very well, you guys should hear it too. Demon Lord Clayman has proposed to initiate the Walpurgis Banquet!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Walpurgis Banquet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Walpurgis Banquet. The special meeting where Demon Lords across the world sit under one roof.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What in the world, when she said &ldquo;initiated&rdquo;, I thought it was some sort of grand magic. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be worrying if he took the initiative in attacking when we are in the midst of planning an attack ourselves?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After further inquiry with Ramiris, I discover that Walpurgis Banquet seems to mean having all the Demon Lord gathered at one place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to initiate the Walpurgis Banquet, it requires approval from at least three Demon Lords. Once initiated, all Demon Lords have a high level of obligation to attend. It is one of the few agreements among the Demon Lords to force Demon Lords, who are acting as they desire, into order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is said also that some of the more casual individuals wouldn&rsquo;t attend the meeting themselves, but instead they would appoint their subordinates to attend in their stead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;If that&rsquo;s the case, there are records which states that there will be a great war after each meeting among Demon Lords. That&rsquo;s why the Western Saints Church decided to name that day the Walpurgis Banquet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Elalude, it is a document from about a thousand years ago that recorded the event. It is said that the Great War has led to great catastrophe with heavy casualties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Due to the Western Saints Church naming the event Walpurgis Banquet, the people all think it means &ldquo;The Demon Lords&rsquo; feast that will destroy world and plunge it into chaos.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The so-called great war is probably referring to the great world war that has happened countless times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or is it really true that when the Demon Lords gather, there will be a great war? Or could it be that they were preparing to provide support to someone for a great war?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does that mean that the great war was caused by the Demon Lords?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way! I don&rsquo;t have that kind of free time, isn&rsquo;t waging war super complicated? No one wants to do that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris instantly dismissed my doubts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how you look at her, she looks like she&rsquo;s got all the spare time in the world&hellip; No, never mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that I think about it, she is one of the Demon Lord too. And she seems to have lived for quite a long time, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be strange if she had attended the meeting a thousand years ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Elalude nods to Ramiris and proceeds to say:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Demon Lord Ramiris&rsquo; words are probably true. The great war has the official name &lsquo;Tenma Great War&rsquo; (Great War between Angels and Demons), where all major forces are competing for control. With that being said&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Elalude, the great war takes place every five hundred years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason for that: it is said that the angelic force from heaven would attack the earth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The army from heaven&mdash;meaning the angel race.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The angels are like the monster&rsquo;s natural nemesis, but they attack indiscriminately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or rather, for some reason, they always pick the most advanced cities to attack first. The reason is unknown, but that is just a rumor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason why we&rsquo;ve stayed underground and refuse to come out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Says Gazel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The development of Dwargon is going well and is surely going to be eye-catching, so this decision is most definitely the right one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s the same case for the Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty Sarion which has its cities built inside the giant caverns of the God Tree. I recall Gazel mentioning the &ldquo;City embraced by the God Tree&rdquo; to Elalude. It must have been a reference to this fact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two powerful nations both took the necessary precautions involving national defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, the Western Nations&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Council&mdash;It was made up of Western Nations in order to defend against the monsters. And the other reason is to survive the Great War.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The countries in the council pledge to help each other out, while Dwargon and Sarion are both able to hold their own ground. The enemy here is the angel race alone&mdash;But it&rsquo;s not the entire story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When the angel race attacks, the monsters also become more active. The monsters in question are ones that possess intelligence, aka the Majins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some Demon Lords would take advantage of the great war to invade human nations. It was the case a thousand years ago and tales depict it to be a brutal scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so, the humans themselves aren&rsquo;t enemies to be underestimated either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The current hypothetical enemy, the Eastern Empire&mdash;Sovereign Alliance of the Nasca Namrium Ulmeria Empire, could be onto something. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The hegemonism</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;of the Eastern Empire doesn&#39;t care for time or location. They could very well march against the Western Nations as soon as they discover their weakness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In conclusion, this is the great war mixed with Angels, monsters and Humans&mdash;so called &ldquo;Tenma Great War&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, it would be a false accusation to blame the Demon Lords as the cause of the Great War.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I myself also wouldn&rsquo;t want to start a war either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of which, if the angels attack the more advanced nations first&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was hoping to develop this town and outrank other cities in prosperity. But this can wait I suppose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be wise to at least hold off on that for now and we prioritize the development and fortification of essential infrastructure for defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that would come later, I need to make a mental note of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, we have to deal with the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, what is the point of the Walpurgis Banquet? Why are all the Demon Lords gathering?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it&rsquo;s not related to the great war, there must be other goals&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, could that be it? Milim did said that the Demon Lords would judge individuals who self-proclaim to be a Demon Lord. Could they be holding a meeting to decide on sending someone to deal with me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that&mdash;First off, you seem to have misunderstood, so allow me to explain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right after which, Ramiris speaks of something that&rsquo;s the furthest from what I could imagination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We actually hold the Banquet quite often. It only needs three or more Demon Lords&rsquo; approval to initiate, so it&rsquo;s not hard. In it&rsquo;s past, it&rsquo;s the equivalent of me, Guy, and Milim having a little tea party&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris tells us and continues:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words the Walpurgis Banquet is just the Demon Lords gathering together to update each other on each other&rsquo;s status while discussing trending topics. It&rsquo;s just that the humans certainly wouldn&rsquo;t know about that, but it&rsquo;s really nothing dramatic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She breaks the huge news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I always thought that this fairy is too simple minded and probably has a horrifyingly large gap in perception compared to the rest of the Demon Lords. So I can&rsquo;t exactly take her words seriously, or it may really lead to something tragic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve got to scold her for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Idiot! If it&rsquo;s just a small tea party, why would you say our nation is doomed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s really done it this time getting someone as gentle as me angry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This annoying brat sure is stupid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, no! The problem isn&rsquo;t the Banquet itself, it&rsquo;s the subject-matter!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris corrects herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The subject-matter? So the Demon Lords have indeed gathered to exterminate me&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to what Ramiris just said, there are two other people supporting Clayman&rsquo;s initiation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are Demon Lord Frey and Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Due to the three Demon Lords&rsquo; motion, including that of Clayman, the proposal is approved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from that, the subject of discussion is&mdash;&rdquo;The rise of the new force in the Great Jura Forest and the Leader of the Forest Alliance dares to proclaim himself as a Demon Lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It must be talking about me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I mean did you&hellip; Did you proclaim yourself a Demon Lord?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t regret it, nor do I intend to reflect on it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I replied honestly since Ramiris asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm&mdash;I am not surprised it&rsquo;s you. You should be fine as long as you stay tenacious, even though there may be a lot of trouble on the way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Says Ramiris sounding quite relaxed and delighted, as if it&rsquo;s none of her business. No, it&rsquo;s indeed none of her business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve already prepared myself mentally, so anything goes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, are they going to punish me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They&rsquo;ve indeed planned on punishing me&mdash;Or so I thought, but things seem different from what I hear from Ramiris soon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is the case in name, but whether you get punished is not the point, it&rsquo;s simply an unwritten rule in our industry. Clayman initiated the Banquet because he claimed Demon Lord Karion has betrayed everyone. Not only that, Clayman is also going to press the issue that his subordinate Myuran was murdered.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is being Demon Lord considered a job? What industry are you talking about? I teased her but got ignored.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that Clayman is claiming someone has murdered Myuran and would probably say the criminal is &ldquo;The new-comer named Rimuru who dares to proclaim himself as a Demon Lord&rdquo;. His goal is likely&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Report. Presumably he is planning to take over the territory of Demon Lord Karion and subjugate the Great Jura Forest.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Probably. I think so as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is that why Clayman&rsquo;s army has taken action? Clayman wants to take the initiative before we could act.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demon Lord Clayman is better than expected&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You! How come you are so calm in the face of such an important issue! According to my source, Karion seems to have been beaten by Milim. Majins under Clayman also seemed to have commenced military operation. In other words, you are no longer being judged, this is already war ! Clayman has found the excuse to attack you all out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even under these circumstances, Ramiris, looking surprisingly serious, went on a tangent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words caused the crowd to panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To even some bigger nations, it&rsquo;s a tremendous deal when a Demon Lord is getting attacked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s to be expected. After all, it may upset the balance of power between the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was expecting it myself, but it was a very big surprise for the rest of the guests. This seems to be a serious topic for discussion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How dare you say that Karion-sama is a traitor! How rude&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Clayman cannot be forgiven. Nice idea of his, but I&rsquo;ll crush his ambitions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even without Karion-sama, our army is still around. We won&rsquo;t allow Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates to just do what they want!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ones who reacted the most are no doubt the three Beastketeers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is to be expected. Since Clayman has by himself declared their master a traitor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And according to what Ramiris said, Clayman also seems interested in taking over Karion&rsquo;s territory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are a step behind. I can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s taking action so fast&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But you can&rsquo;t expect him to be acting with good intentions, so we have to clean this mess up soon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calm down, Ramiris. I did proclaim myself to be a Demon Lord, but I didn&rsquo;t kill Myuran.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nothing in particular, those are lies by Clayman. I expected that he would come looking to punish me by accusing me of killing Myuran.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-hold on a second? Do you have a single fact to back that up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well about that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Pardon me, Demon Lord Ramiris-sama. Please allow me to speak. The one who is rumored to be dead (Myuran who&rsquo;s Clayman&rsquo;s Majin subordinate) is actually me &hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I plan on thoroughly destroying Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I intended to have him misjudge the situation of Myuran&rsquo;s death, hence why I&rsquo;ve expected Clayman to make a move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not me who got baited, instead it&rsquo;s Clayman fell for my trap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This has nothing to do with the other Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris is astonished upon hearing Myuran&rsquo;s name, but she regained her composure shortly after.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah? Eh? That would mean&hellip; I get it! The real criminal is Demon Lord Clayman!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think anyone can see that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris begins to brag about her deduction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But sadly, it is an easy deduction anyone could make.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I agree with your view, but I&rsquo;ve got something to ask too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I kinda pity here, so I played along a little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Additionally, I have some concerns with regards to some of her claims, so I decided to ask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s the matter? Why don&rsquo;t you just ask me, the famed detective Ramiris?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah crap, I was just playing along and now she&rsquo;s gotten all cocky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And where did this famed detective come from?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could it be that she also had a sneak peek at Veldora&rsquo;s manga too? No, that&rsquo;s not my concern right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I need to ask my questions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What would the other Demon Lords do in circumstances such as this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t have many expectations for her, but I&rsquo;ll ask anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, she&rsquo;s probably a good reference source since she&rsquo;s been a Demon Lord for such a long time. I asked this question based on all these considerations&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The assembly quiets down awaiting Ramiris&rsquo; answer. The others are also interested in finding out the answer to my question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris however doesn&rsquo;t seem to care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uhh? How am I supposed to know? I&rsquo;ve only been told about the Banquet initiation and was told to participate!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She answered without a care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, it&rsquo;s a waste expecting anything from her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s a little kid after all. I&rsquo;m lucky enough that she even bothered to come and report this to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next question,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then Ramiris, let me ask you, when will the Walpurgis Banquet be held? Do you know a specific date?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to create a plan to defeat Clayman, I need to take that into consideration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, didn&rsquo;t I tell you? Lemme think, I think it&rsquo;s three days from now, the night of the new moon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three days from today, it seems earlier than I expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be pretty difficult to try and take down Clayman in three days.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm&mdash;How about this&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We will make a final stand with him after the Walpurgis Banquet?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I&rsquo;ve got to discuss this with everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, I&rsquo;ve asked Ramiris all the things I wanted. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Considering that seems to be the only thing Ramiris came here to do, I won&rsquo;t be able to get more information out of her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And suddenly another thought hit me, so I decided to ask another question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, so why did you come here to inform us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? Well, honestly, if you got killed, I don&rsquo;t know what would happen to my Beretta. That&rsquo;s why I decided to make the trip to help you. That&rsquo;s all it is. it&rsquo;s why I also plan to build an entrance to the labyrinth here. It&rsquo;s fine right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be! Eh, how did we end up on that topic? And an entrance to the labyrinth, what the hell are you trying to build here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m glad that you came to inform me, but this seems to be a completely different matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eheh&mdash;! It&rsquo;s really nothing, so don&rsquo;t mind this type of small favor now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s not even listening to me. That attitude seems to suggest the deal is already settled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seriously, this fairy sure is laid back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I mind it a lot, and you&rsquo;d better be cautious with your words! Also, please stop treating Beretta like some personal object you own!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;d better not try and make any decision on your own&mdash;I&rsquo;ll reject it without any hesitation. If you create an entrance to your labyrinth here, it will definitely lead to more trouble. And about the issue regarding Beretta, it&rsquo;s not just about me. Beretta&rsquo;s opinions matter in this too, so how could you &ldquo;decide&rdquo; just like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The concerns that I had just sent the conversation on a pretty unexpected path.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We got into a heated debate that amounted to nothing. I can&rsquo;t really stand that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, we parted on the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&#39;m currently quite busy too, so I have no time to spare hanging around with Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She went back to reading her manga since she completed her mission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve also made promises with the guests from the other nations to check back with them on other information. They&rsquo;ve also accepted. Afterward, the participants of the meeting left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuze decides to stay in the inn for the night before returning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that your nation has caught the ire of the Demon Lords, do prepare yourself. Demon Lords are dangerous existence. Even though I know, Rimuru-san, that you&rsquo;re pretty powerful as well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Says Fuze out of his worries for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I understand him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the worst-case scenario, I might make foes out of several Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Within the Ten Great Demon Lords right now, who can we expect to become our enemies?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demon Lord Karion is still missing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris seems to suggest she would be on my side, so she can be excluded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Milim&hellip; I&rsquo;m worrying about her the most. She must have been tricked by someone, so I&rsquo;ve got to plan for the worst.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we end up in a stalemate for real, I may end up becoming enemies with the eight other Demon Lords. Despite that, even if we are to become enemies with just Milim, we&rsquo;d better run as far as we can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, when there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s a way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I said trying to reassure Fuze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elalude is also being scummy and wants to stay here for a few days, saying that he hasn&rsquo;t had the chance to chat with Elen for far too long, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We didn&rsquo;t take him to an inn but, instead, to our luxury hotel. This facility is the pride of our nation and if we want to impress him, we will definitely have our hotel welcome the Grand Duke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of Elalude, his professional and private personas are so different to see. He&rsquo;s so attached to his daughter while Elen instead only wishes to stay away from him. I do pray that he won&rsquo;t further anger Elen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel also decides to spend the night so we arranged for him to stay at the hotel where Elalude is staying. I could tell from their conversation that they&rsquo;ve known each other for a long time. It is rumored that they&rsquo;ve even fought alongside each other once, and Elalude also seems to be a very powerful mage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is quite surprising for sure, but since they would also be communicating with our nation in the future as well, it&rsquo;s a good thing to have their friendship strengthened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, the guests at the meeting are all important figures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the future, these heads of nations would make an incredible impact on the way of life in the human nations. In retrospect, we are already equal in status.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though our meeting turned into a clown fiesta after that stubborn fairy showed up, it was still a fruitful meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, the meeting was dismissed.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We didn&#39;t get a chance to rest afterwards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We still have to draft our plans in case we incur the ire of the other Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After we all had a chance to have our meals, we gather at the meeting room once again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time the only guests are the Beastketeers and Myuran.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Youmu and Grucius are preparing for their journey to come. Grucius wanted to participate too but got rejected by the Beastketeers. The two of them hold a lot of responsibility with their coming mission, so Phobio hopes they could try their best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were planning to have Myuran prepare for it as well, but she&rsquo;s the only one here who&rsquo;s familiar with Clayman. So we decided to let her assist us and attend the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The strange thing is that even Diablo decided to join.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu, I don&rsquo;t need to do any preparations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since he&rsquo;s so adamant, I kind of have to accept his proposition. But his participation won&rsquo;t matter too much even if he joins so I&rsquo;ll just let him be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris, for some reason, also joined in the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s you! What&rsquo;s this all about? What is going on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as I entered the meeting room, Ramiris flew up to me and complains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s what now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I ask, as she begins to complain with a blush on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here&rsquo;s what she had to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During the break time, she was brought to the canteen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I completely forgot about her, but there were people who came to spend time with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, those people were the Dryads such as Treyni-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They all once served under Ramiris when she was the Queen of Spirits and recognized Ramiris instantly. Ramiris received a warm welcome from them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That sounds great.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah! It&rsquo;s superb! That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m staying here too, Rimuru!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems Ramiris has taken a liking to this town. This Demon Lord who&rsquo;s been alone and without subordinates gets all cocky once she receives some admiration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyway, Ramiris was touring the town accompanied by others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was mesmerized by all the sights and decided to stay here from now on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you to not make any wild decisions on your own! Besides, Treyni-san and the other Dryads are the moderators of the Great Jura Forest. They live in a different place than us, so they can&rsquo;t spend their everyday accompanying you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three Dryads sisters were looking really delighted while waiting behind Ramiris during the conversation. I sneak a glance towards them and continue to lecture Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Ramiris won&rsquo;t listen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You meanie&mdash;! Isn&rsquo;t it great, no matter what happens, you get to enjoy my assistance! The strongest, world dominating, Ramiris-sama&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I ever need your help, it would probably&mdash;No, I shouldn&rsquo;t say it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I tell her my honest opinion it would probably make Ramiris cry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, we will take care of Ramiris-sama, please view it in a positive light.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Please consider it!&rdquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only Ramiris, even Treyni-san and her sisters begin asking me for this favor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, no matter how you look at it, all she seems to be is a troublemaker. If Ramiris ends up just casually running around here while we get more communication with humans in the future, she will definitely become an eyesore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm&mdash;I&rsquo;ll need to think on this request some more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand, I&rsquo;ll take it into consideration&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really! Sasuga Rimuru, such a doll!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll figure out what type of situations we may run into when Ramiris comes to this town later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now I&rsquo;ve got other issues to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Ramiris quieting down, we can finally commence our military meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, I know everyone must be exhausted from the long meetings, but I hope you will all endure it for a just a bit more. Right now we have two subjects to discuss. First being the &lsquo;Battle against Clayman&rsquo; and the other is the &lsquo;Walpurgis Banquet&rsquo;. Thanks to the information provided by Ramiris-chan here, I know we&rsquo;ve been targeted. Let&rsquo;s first hear Souei&rsquo;s report and draft an attack plan. Souei, please tell us about Clayman&rsquo;s army.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After my opening speech, Souei begins the report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as we were having the meeting, Clayman&rsquo;s army seemed to be on the move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They&rsquo;ve been resting in Milim&rsquo;s territory and entering combat formation. Apart from that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The one leading the army doesn&rsquo;t seem to be Clayman himself. The commander has brought several Majins with an unusual amount of magicules, but they are about the same level as the Beastketeers. It is too weak to be Demon Lord Clayman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei concludes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that guy sure is arrogant&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If we are talking about Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates that can rival the Beastketeers, there are three that come to my mind&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So many! I see no matter how despicable he is, he is still a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are: &ldquo;Middle Finger&rdquo; Yamza, &ldquo;Index finger&rdquo; Adalman, and &ldquo;The thumb&rdquo; The Nine-headed Beast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These three seem to be the members of Clayman&rsquo;s proud organization known as the &ldquo;Five-Fingers&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myuran apparently was the &ldquo;Ring Finger&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Additionally, there is the &ldquo;Pinkie Finger&rdquo; Piorra. That guy seems to rarely show up given his role as an intelligence collector.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m more concerned about the Moderate Jester Association, but Myuran claims to know nothing about them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Clayman is the type of Demon Lord that won&rsquo;t even trust his subordinates. I won&rsquo;t be surprised if he has ordered someone else to overlook the operation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is he like the audience watching a puppet show?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may end up like the Orc Lord incident where people are operating even without the knowledge of Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates&rsquo; involvement. We need to be cautious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that, Myuran, who is the commander?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei saw a slim Majin and reported that he&rsquo;s the commanding general. &ldquo;Telepathy Net&rdquo; sure is convenient for sharing information with everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He is Yamza. The Magic Frost Swordsman Yamza. He is a despicable and cruel scumbag, but nonetheless a powerful individual. I didn&rsquo;t get along well with him given the fact that he voluntarily pledged his loyalty towards Clayman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the commander is Yamza.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Myuran&rsquo;s description, he seems to be the strongest Majin within the Five-Fingers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman gave him a priceless magic sword possessing the power of freezing, and the infamous title of Magic Frost Swordsman which has spread across the land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, his capabilities are still unknown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Clayman&rsquo;s army, it consists of thirty thousand Majins led by Yamza.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each and every one of which possesses a different ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Souei&rsquo;s observation, eighty percent of them are of Rank B. The remaining ones are almost all A-. Some of the higher ranked officers may even reach Rank A or are on par with Gelmud in terms of power. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although they are a lot more powerful in comparison to the Farmus Army I eliminated, there is still little to fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem lies with the commander Yamza or rather, it disappoints me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they a little too weak?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On our side, there are more than twenty thousand people who have taken refuge here from the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania. Half of them are capable of combat, making up roughly ten thousand people. They are already Rank B under normal circumstances, and they would even evolve to A- after their beastilization, which makes them an incredible force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the Knight Order from Farmus Kingdom averaged out to Rank B with their magic fortification. It just goes to show how strong the Beast Kingdom warriors are.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not to mention the huge gap between the basic abilities of Humans and Beastmen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just these people alone can form a huge combat force. In addition, there are other available combatants spread around. After they retreated from the capital, they reunited with Beastmen members from the nearby tribes scattered over the land. The veterans from the Beast King Army took command of these individuals and rearranged them into a capable force hiding near the area. With these forces combined, there will be an additional ten thousand soldiers. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That makes around twenty-thousand Ranked A- warriors. That indeed is an impressive amount of combat prowess. As expected from a Demon Lord who dominates his land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is indeed strange. No matter how strong this Majin Yamza is, us Beastketeers will not lose to him. And even if we have less men in our army compared to them, we still have an overwhelming advantage in terms of the combat abilities of our warriors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right. We are quite confident in leading soldiers to the war!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do they think they can look down on us because Karion-sama has passed away? No way, Clayman isn&rsquo;t that stupid&hellip; &ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis agrees with my views.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Phobio and Suphia also followed up to express their opinions, believing that Clayman&rsquo;s army won&rsquo;t be much of a threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">If that&rsquo;s the case</span><span class="c1">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A mumble escapes Benimaru&rsquo;s lips:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a second? Could it be that Clayman never intended to target this town?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, we may have been misled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This town has constantly been a target, and with Ramiris telling us that we&rsquo;ve become a target of Clayman&rsquo;s, we might have been misled into believing that this town is his target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was planning on initiating a pincer-attack on Clayman&rsquo;s army when he passes through Yuurazania in order to beat him&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But things aren&rsquo;t as simple as I expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does he want to attack the Beast Kingdom? There are only refugees plus the ten thousand warriors in the area. Even with a higher quality of warriors, they would not be able to overcome the vast gulf in numbers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It does make sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Souei, his army is residing in Milim&rsquo;s territory for now. However, his army has already begun reorganization. Tomorrow, if not the day after, he would likely march on the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is unlikely they would take any action tonight, but I have to consider that as a possibility as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This might mean that Clayman doesn&rsquo;t know about us given we&rsquo;ve been extra cautious of him&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld calmly states, but I won&#39;t put too much expectation on it. We must plan for the worst-case scenario in order to remain adaptable to various situations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If he is indeed heading to this town, Clayman won&rsquo;t ignore the many dangers lying behind him. So he would likely only commence that operation after getting rid of all the threats&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myuran concludes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, that&rsquo;s exactly how I would go about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is that the case, eh, getting rid of threats?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi, do you mean then&hellip; that Clayman plans to kill all of the remaining Beast Kingdom warriors?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may be passable if he&rsquo;s only killing the warriors but&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. Prediction towards Demon Lord Clayman has updated. The chances of his goal being to awaken as a &ldquo;True Demon Lord&rdquo; is one hundred percent. Prediction: He would not include this town in his plan. While his method is sloppy with incorrect deductions, it is most certain that he would decimate all life forces within the borders of the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania&mdash;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is that so? Of course he is planning on killing everyone without mercy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I may sound rather hypocritical saying this, but his ruthless methods really appall me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is very cautious with his actions. He may even have his eyes on this town as part of his extended road map. In other words, he would most likely discover any reinforcements I send.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And even without considering that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Clayman has very strong intelligence gathering capabilities. That&rsquo;s why he must have already known that the Beastketeers and Karion&rsquo;s army have evacuated to this town. Besides, it will take at least two days to move from here to the Beast Kingdom&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are at a complete disadvantage here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Alvis said, Clayman has seen through everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We won&rsquo;t make it in time even if we deploy the Rank B equivalent warriors&rsquo; regiments and move out without any sleep or rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I want to have all of my subordinates take part in this fight, but by the time we arrive at the battlefield, the people from the Beast Kingdom would likely have already been slaughtered&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Would Clayman awaken if everyone is massacred?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. Despite the lack of efficiency, it will grant him a large amount of souls. Clayman&rsquo;s rate of success in awakening&mdash;Seventy-eight percent. Additionally, his chances of success would increase if he has obtained the required amount of souls within a shorter time-span.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is becoming a really difficult situation; I must stop him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not even for the citizens of the Beast Kingdom whom I&rsquo;ve never met, but for myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve never met those citizens, yet they were willing to forge a friendship between our nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Trust is more valuable than gold, and kindness should be repaid with kindness. That&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t go easy on my interventions here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru, go and stop them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I assigned him an extremely challenging task, yet he only responds with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aye, I&rsquo;ll do just that&mdash;No, it would be my pleasure to carry out your orders!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru. He is pretty obedient by heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He often goes back to his original tone whenever he gets excited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he believes that there is a difference between his professional and private life, so he is always very respectful to me in front of others&hellip;but you don&rsquo;t have to treat our current meeting as that important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s indeed unpleasant to be looked down upon, and I understand you are doing so to prevent that from happening, but&hellip; In this country, I doubt there is anyone who looks down on me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s like, performing better than your senior would probably result in an awkward relationship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">People realize this type of thing when they enter society.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I decided to steel my heart and give Benimaru the order as his superior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. As such, the defense battle of the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania is officially commencing. Let&rsquo;s talk about how to win the battle with Benimaru acting as the key player.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone bows. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the three Beastketeers joined in. It seems I did sound quite imposing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This Clayman is far more cunning than I expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps the Walpurgis Banquet three days later is also part of his plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is probably planning to slaughter the people of the Beast Kingdom before any other Demon Lords intervene and report it afterward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It will take some time to unite the local combatants, and if things continue as it is, the warrior groups would be defeated one by one even with only a futile resistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what would follow would likely be the massacre of the residents who are incapable of fighting back&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since we&rsquo;ve decided to stop this, everyone was eager to voice their opinions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone wants to gather forces and head out immediately, but no one spoke up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone here knows the importance of information gathering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason why I&rsquo;ve announced my intentions of taking down Clayman but took no immediate action is because I&rsquo;ve been waiting for Souei to report back. In addition, our soldiers are currently switching gears and gathering resources at the town plaza.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kaijin, Garm and Dold are using their craftsmanship to help create new weapons and armor for them in preparation for war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So there is no need to rush.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We need to know where our enemies are, the structure of their army, their number, as well as their intent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We won&rsquo;t make much of anything by simply marching in blindly without any knowledge on these matters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our discussion will soon be concluded for a while.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve confirmed their forces to be there. We will definitely win if we are to make it in time. But the problem lies in how we&rsquo;re going to get there. We have to buy some time, or we won&rsquo;t make it as things stand right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about we first send in the Goblin Riders and Gabiru&rsquo;s forces to distract them for a while?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it would be pointless. I&rsquo;ve sent men to investigate the geography of the Beast Kingdom. It mostly consists of plains and small hills. It&rsquo;s not a great place for ambush tactics. It may be more effective to make an aerial assault, but a mere hundred soldier assault would amount to nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru regained his calm demeanor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we are to lay an ambush, the orchards near the bank of the big river would be a good place. But the many hills there that are beneficial for water drainage make it too eye-catching, so the geography is also unsuitable for having our troops perform an ambush attack. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou&rsquo;s suggestion got rejected. So far Benimaru is making the correct calls. I heard Suphia whisper: &ldquo;What in the world, when did he investigate our nation&rsquo;s geography&hellip;&rdquo; I&rsquo;m curious about that as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s likely that he sent someone to do the investigation when he was acting as the head of the diplomatic team. Should I see this as him being overly cautious or reliable in work&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia doesn&rsquo;t seem to be holding a grudge against it, so I&rsquo;ll just pretend I didn&rsquo;t hear that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There are only four hundred Beastmen troops that are specialized in speed. There are less than a hundred of the rare Bird-beast type soldiers. They would be sacrificed in vain if we are to send them first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis is also worried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It also doesn&rsquo;t mean that they won&rsquo;t be tired from flying. And even with Gabiru&rsquo;s troops, there are barely two hundred of them. Sending them first really won&rsquo;t do much to help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The location has a clear field of view, so there is no use sending smaller units.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, we went in circles with our attack plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have to give it our all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can have the soldiers all over the location find the residents and help take them refuge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once they enter the Tempest Federation, Treyni-san and her companions can act as a support to raise their chances of survival. Then, we will have the speed-oriented units engage in guerilla warfare to facilitate their escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We will then have the slower ground troops to both accept the refugees and fend off Clayman&rsquo;s army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a race against time with much luck involved, but we can&rsquo;t think of any better ideas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why, in order to prevent things from escalating in the wrong direction, we (Tempest) will engage with the enemy too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fellow executives&mdash;Benimaru, Shuna, Souei, Shion, Geld and Ranga&mdash;They&rsquo;ve all learned the extra skill &ldquo;Dimension Transportation&rdquo; and can manipulate the &ldquo;Teleportation Door&rdquo; that connects two different spatial coordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo seems to be also capable of this, but he&rsquo;s moving out with Youmu&rsquo;s party, so there is no chance for him to show off this time. If the situation worsens, I would call him back. But I wish to resolve this situation with the seven people in total including myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though I could take on the army by myself, showing off in battle is a big taboo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Especially since Shuna is not good at face-to-face combat. I&rsquo;ve sent Hakurou and Gabiru to protect her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped; this is what we have to do. As long as we are able to buy more time, we can prevent casualties. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if I can just somehow use teleportation magic to transport them there&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mumbled to myself as a joke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we can use magic to teleport our troops there, it would resolve the issue immediately. But even with my &ldquo;Dimension Manipulation&rdquo;, it is impossible to transport a thousand-man army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. Teleportation magic can transport goods at relatively low cost. It can directly connect different dimensions to the coordinates of the teleportation location. This would induce a large amount of magicules to surround the area, unsuitable for transportation of organic matter. However, by using &ldquo;Barrier&rdquo; to protect their bodies, it will mitigate the effects during teleportation. This is the principle of teleportation magic&mdash; &gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmmm&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s the difference between teleportation and transference&hellip;The key difference is to have additional magical protection applied to the objects being teleported, so it uses more magicules.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ehh? That would mean&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&mdash;In other words, for Majins or monsters who possess resistance towards magicules or if they are able to cast &ldquo;Barrier&rdquo; on their own, teleportation would become feasible for them. Alternatively, one can also cast the complete teleportation technique that invokes protection on the target&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would mean as long as the target possess strength to withstand a large amount of magicule exposure, it can then pass through the special transportation dimension. This seems to be the same principle as the extra skill &ldquo;Dimensional Transportation&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve got to keep an eye on this matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be clearer, it would be possible to even teleport people if the subjects being teleported are completely protected beforehand. No no no, that would be the actual way to use transportation magic, but even if that&rsquo;s the case, wouldn&rsquo;t it still cost a lot of magicules? Plus there isn&rsquo;t enough time for me to modify it to the point of being able to accommodate an army of over ten-thousand of soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer: The magic has been developed. Additionally, with the combined use of &ldquo;Dimensional Manipulation&rdquo;, its magicule cost has been successfully reduced.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wow, this is really impressive!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s with this sudden growth of Raphael-sama?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has already developed magic and skills for me even before I requested them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of which, after I awakened as a Demon Lord, my skills have all evolved dramatically and I&rsquo;ve not been able to familiarize myself with them at all. If it were not for &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo;, I would have been wasting away the potential of those skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raphael was able to develop magic likely due to the effect of &ldquo;Ability Change&rdquo;. Regardless, it is more than desirable to me. It has even prepared the magic I&rsquo;ve been dreaming of. Simply perfect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, using teleportation magic to transport an army would be too risky&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna tries to persuade me as she also seems to be aware of its dangers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that part has been resolved just now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, Shuna is right. But just now, I&rsquo;ve developed a new magic!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m beginning to sympathize with Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Had I not evolved, you likely would have emerged as the victor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-Nani!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;developed what now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Surprise is written on everyone&rsquo;s faces and they all look towards me with respect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nod in response, and ask them:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It all depends on your resolves now. I could use this magic and transport the entire army to their destination in one go. However, it would be my first time casting such magic, so no there&rsquo;s guarantee of your personal safety, nor do I have any time for experimentation. If that&rsquo;s the case, would you still be willing to trust me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have faith in &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Raphael says it&rsquo;s fine, then it won&rsquo;t be a problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I don&rsquo;t know what everyone else thinks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Are they willing to believe me like this and entrust their lives to me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry. I&rsquo;ve sworn loyalty to you. Since I am a servant under Rimuru-sama, I shall sacrifice myself even if that&rsquo;s your desire. Your orders will never trouble us, and we are all aware of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru responded with a feral smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The veterans all agree with his point of view. Even the new-comer Diablo nods with a bizarre, monstrous smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from that, the Beastketeers also followed suit&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We believe in you. We&rsquo;ve come to seek your help so there&rsquo;s no way we&rsquo;ll doubt you Rimuru-sama&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. I&rsquo;ve been saved by you once already. My subordinates are all aware of that, and they certainly won&rsquo;t complain,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara ara, it seems like I can&rsquo;t disagree with this. My troop happens to be the slowest, and I do hope Rimuru-sama would give us a helping hand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia came to that conclusion without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Phobio has had faith in me from the start,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Alvis, who initially was doubtful and hesitant, but nonetheless chose to believe in me in the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then your lives have, here and now, been entrusted to me! This way we can surprise Clayman. The rest of it will be up to you, you must achieve victory!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Yes Sir&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brave smiles begin to emerge on everyone&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If our troops move now, their victory would be guaranteed. No matter how tightly Clayman has been surveilling the town, he won&rsquo;t be able to discover the movements of our army now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;ve got victory in our grip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, everyone rediscovers their calmness now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I give the task of redesigning the attack plan to Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, Souei has brought some updates to his report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He says that about a hundred of the Worshipers of Dragon have joined Clayman&rsquo;s army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A hundred? If that&rsquo;s the only people joining, it shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Does Benimaru know of the background of these Worshipers of Dragon?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh yeah, Souei, who are these worshipers of dragon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not sure about it so I decide to ask directly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To your question, they worship dragon, that is the Dragon Princess Milim-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, I see, so they are subordinates of Milim. Wait, but Milim said she doesn&rsquo;t have any subordinates. They may actually be worshiping her on their own volition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This organization don&rsquo;t seem to have a name for their nation, yet they have a total population of around hundred thousand. They probably have been in peaceful co-existence with nature and leading a quiet life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman seems to also be watching over them by crossing their domain and having them accompanying the army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei wasn&rsquo;t able to dig any deeper, so the Worshipers of Dragon are temporarily listed as part of the individuals under observation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I order Souei to resume the surveillance over Clayman&rsquo;s army and find an appropriate location for the deployment of our army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, the subject of &ldquo;Battle against Clayman&rdquo; has concluded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alright, now for the next topic in line.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In regard to the &ldquo;Walpurgis Banquet&rdquo; reported by Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Beastketeers left the meeting room first, having to inform their subordinates about our decision. They trust me and agreed to using the teleportation magic. So they probably went to inform their soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myuran also followed close after, since the issue at hand now is our problem and doesn&rsquo;t require her input any longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her job is to assist Youmu.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that there are only my close companions left in the room, I got to relax a fair bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Given the circumstances, the atmosphere of the meeting has changed drastically, I&rsquo;ve decided to just chat about what we think without any restraint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I could locate Clayman&rsquo;s location, I could just use &lsquo;Dimensional Transportation&rsquo; to hop over and give him a round or two of beating to finish things up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With his army on the move, there can&rsquo;t be that much left at his base. So I won&rsquo;t have to worry about the attack. I only need to move with my subordinates, and we may be able to put an end to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the flip side, if I am to attack some place, we need to make sure we don&#39;t let down the defense of this town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I need to spend more time thinking about this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Apologies. There emerged multiple areas that possessed a high magicule concentration. We deemed it dangerous, so we didn&rsquo;t pass through.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei started to apologize to me as he reports, but it&rsquo;s alright. After all even with his &ldquo;Clone&rdquo; active, he still had to act cautiously. It will be bad if the enemy got hold of our movement if we just end up moving into a trap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The enemy&rsquo;s base of operations may be hidden behind this fog bank, so knowing this is enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about we send out a few people to investigate their base using the weak points in enemy force?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, wouldn&rsquo;t Clayman be attending Walpurgis Banquet? There&rsquo;s a chance we might miss him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru expresses his view though Shuna rejects it calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru made an awkward expression in response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It makes sense. In addition, if we underestimate the enemy force, our vanguard would get overwhelmed instead resulting in their pull back. This would render our efforts rather meaningless. I think Benimaru-sama should focus on leading the army instead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou delivered the final blow and ended the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are there any other ideas?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyhow, let&rsquo;s hear about everyone else&rsquo;s ideas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes! Shion begins to raise her hand energetically while looking at me&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I gave her permission to speak up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about we attack the site of Walpurgis Banquet directly and kill off not only Clayman, but any other Demon Lords who dare to disagree with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She says with sparkling eyes (:ShionSparklings: (&#65417;</span><span class="c23">&#9685;</span><span class="c2">&#12526;</span><span class="c23">&#9685;</span><span class="c2">)&#65417;*:&#12539;&#65439;</span><span class="c29">&#10023;</span><span class="c1">).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s my fault for asking for advice from an idiot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The annoyance is almost causing veins to emerge on my temple, but I&rsquo;ve endured it. This seemed to have happened before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shion, how are you going to do that? I mean, can&rsquo;t you provide some more practical ideas?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Killing Clayman alone is tough enough as it is, how are we supposed to fight all the other Demon Lords together?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the very least we should take them down individually&mdash;I scolded Shion strictly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, she loses all her spirit and looks very down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s really no helping with her, guess I&rsquo;ll play along a little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I went on a tangent (to praise her), after all I still adore Shion a fair bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, maybe rushing in may actually be a good suggestion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion then raises her face with excitement written all over her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What a realist approach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just asking, Ramiris, but is it possible for me to participate?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked Ramiris who&rsquo;s more experienced with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh? Do you want to participate, Rimuru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s just for reference. Since Clayman is going to participate in the meeting, so if I take the initiative, it might make things more interesting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since I&rsquo;ve already been targeted, striking first may actually be a good idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Preemptively striking is tactically basic, but Clayman most definitely would be surprised with me showing up to where he would least expect me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It might not be a good idea to use violence in a meeting, but I&rsquo;d like to try it first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm&mdash;It should be fine. However, you can only bring at most two people as companions!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bringing a bunch of subordinates would only cause unnecessary trouble, so I can&rsquo;t take too many of them with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve heard story of some newly enrolled Demon Lord that tried to be imposing and brought hundreds of his close subordinates to the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This action uncannily enraged a Demon Lord who&rsquo;s been mad at (her) territory having been wiped out at the time.</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That Demon Lord&rsquo;s anger probably could have been vented on anyone. And so he ended up killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that incident, the meeting forbids Majins with insufficient strength to participate. And among the Demon Lords, they may only take two companions along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this would also mean that there has been that type of disputes in the past. So it should be fine for me to go as someone looking for trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Barging in and accusing Clayman directly, I should seriously consider this idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you think? Wouldn&rsquo;t my participation in it be very interesting?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu, this proposal is wonderful. Would you allow me to accompany you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bastard, Diablo! I will be the one to accompany Rimuru-Sama. I won&rsquo;t let you have him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the two of them begin to argue again. (Diablo and Shion)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be suicide bringing these two along, but I wasn&rsquo;t planning to have the two of them in the same place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just as this idea was raised&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Since we will eventually fight against all the Demon Lords anyways, let&rsquo;s just kill them all. After all, shouldn&rsquo;t it be enough to just have Rimuru-sama as the only Demon Lord?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And even Diablo begins to spout out nonsense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion agrees completely and begins to nod her head excitedly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! And here I thought you are an idiot. That&rsquo;s some very profound views from a newbie! I didn&rsquo;t expect you to give voice to all my thoughts!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Should I see them as sharing a tacit relationship or being on bad term?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I have to pick someone, I think Shion is more brain dead, but&hellip;both of them seem equally bent on beating up the other Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How did things end up like this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking around, I find several people at the scene agreeing with their views.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some people are being cautious, while some are highly ecstatic, even giving off a killing intent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For some reason, the number of warmongers among us has only increased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that method is way too reckless. So I have to interjected quickly to bring the discussion back on track.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a second, don&rsquo;t get ahead yourselves now. We haven&rsquo;t settled on things yet. And as for Diablo, I&rsquo;ve assigned you on the mission concerning Farmus Kingdom. So there&rsquo;s no way I can bring you with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-Indeed. Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems Diablo thinks the mission regarding the Farmus Kingdom is rather simple. He seems confident enough, but I hope he won&rsquo;t suffer a Waterloo if he underestimates his enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With some regrets and a mix of joy in being assigned a mission by me, Diablo made a mixed expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, wouldn&rsquo;t it be too dangerous still?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna&rsquo;s tone gives off a sense of worry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, these are the opinion we hold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Moreover wouldn&rsquo;t it be more efficient to try to attack Clayman&rsquo;s base when he&rsquo;s not there? Hence there&rsquo;s no reason to attend the Walpurgis &ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld speaks up cautiously, seemingly agreeing with Shuna&rsquo;s views.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems to be the more viable tactic, avoiding risk and fight winnable battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld is also quite eager to fight, but he is not as reckless. It&rsquo;s very delightful to hear so many opinions under much consideration. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there are other reasons as to why I&rsquo;m considering attending the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something is concerning me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, Rimuru-sama is worrying about the intent of Demon Lord Milim-sama. It is unthinkable that Milim-sama would betray us, so she&rsquo;s most likely being manipulated by Clayman. Or she has some plan of her own, but at the very least she did in fact attack Demon Lord Karion-sama. So attending the Walpurgis Banquet to find out the truth behind it wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. Milim-sama being one of people who initiated the Banquet is also concerning. Hence there must be some sort of conspiracy behind it, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Surprisingly, Benimaru&rsquo;s comment aligns perfectly with my thoughts while Souei also points out my concerns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sasuga Benimaru and Souei. They have the same views as me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, Milim following Clayman&rsquo;s every orders, there&rsquo;s no way that that would have happened in this world. Because Milim is way too stubborn!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Do you have any right to criticize her, Ramiris? That thought popped into my head, but she and I shared the same view.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milim-sama would never betray Rimuru-sama. Even though this is just my hunch, but I still pretty sure that I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion asserts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right, we don&rsquo;t have any proof either&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I also don&rsquo;t think that she&rsquo;ll betray us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; also reached the same conclusion even though it couldn&rsquo;t be hundred-percent sure without sufficient information to back up this claim, there&rsquo;s no way such a thing would happen without a drastic change in situation. I decided to have faith in Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even if that&rsquo;s the case, I can&rsquo;t just leave it this way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I also agree with all of your points and I don&rsquo;t think Milim would betray me. Therefore, something must have happened. As Ramiris said, let&rsquo;s assume Clayman isn&rsquo;t the culprit here, but I still think it is highly likely that he has been the puppet master behind all of these events thus far. So I&rsquo;ll take Benimaru&rsquo;s advice and participate in the Walpurgis Banquet to investigate how things were there&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something would definitely happen in between the session.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the worst-case scenario, Milim may attack us by the end of Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is what concerns me the most, and the reason why I think it&rsquo;s still dangerous even if we just leave it as it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fighting Clayman alone won&rsquo;t really be a problem, however, the goal is to avoid engagement with Milim in any form of confrontation as much as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;See? I told you I&rsquo;m right! Indeed, indeed, everything has been expected by the famed detective Ramiris. If that&rsquo;s the case, we just have to go and beat the crap out of Clayman!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I thought I was successful in leading the topic and concluded the most dangerous conversation&mdash;yet now Ramiris begins shouting some bizarre nonsense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Also, what even is the deal here? Why are there so many powerful Majins just running around here? You should just let Beretta be my servant since you have so many strong subordinates already!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she then dared to say that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris sure is being quite outrageous. She&rsquo;s only gotten bolder after discovering the strength of my companions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I didn&rsquo;t plan on giving Beretta up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But more importantly, we need to consider what Beretta wants in this situation, not just what Ramiris wants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, some of my subordinates seem to share the same sentiments with Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, that sounds reasonable. Very well, I shall go kill him. I shall return shortly&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, hold on hold on, calm down now Shion. Let&rsquo;s prepare first before going, you too, Benimaru and Souei!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seriously,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The situation turned into something of a mess like this as soon as I decided to participate in the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru have to engage with Clayman&rsquo;s army, same goes for Souei.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the military meeting continues, I need to assess cautiously about the candidates as to who will be my two companions to the Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the candidates I&rsquo;m looking for are&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suddenly felt the pressure from a sharp stare coming from behind my back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can figure it out with your joint that it&rsquo;s Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She would probably go crazy if I didn&rsquo;t take her with me. It seems that it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly hard for Benimaru to keep her in check, so I guess I&rsquo;d have to take care of this mess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s more, Shion almost died by Clayman&rsquo;s ploy&mdash;or should I say that she was literally killed over it&mdash;hence, this may be a great chance for revenge, that&rsquo;s why I wish to bring her along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that, Shion has been selected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other one is rather hard to choose, but Ranga seems like a good candidate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was planning to have him hide in my shadow, but it will be problematic if the location has some special barrier similar to &ldquo;Holy Purification Barrier&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I found out that Ranga has been listening in all this time anticipating to join, so I suppose I should take Ranga too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is a competent bodyguard after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that, I made my decision to bring Shion and Ranga with me. Both of whom have the ability of &ldquo;Dimensional Transportation&rdquo; which is one of my reason for bringing them since they can easily escape with me if anything happens.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as they&rsquo;ve experienced the newly made barrier inspired by &ldquo;Holy Purification Barrier&rdquo;, they should have a good chance of escaping even in the worst-case scenario.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three of us should move out together and head straight to the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Milim is indeed being unfortunately controlled, the next thing being destroyed would most likely be this town. That is a possibility that I need to prevent no matter the cost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I will not let this town suffer once again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s participate then. I&rsquo;ll bring Shion and Ranga along. Ramiris, could you help convey the message that I wish to participate?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, I understand!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris answers without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then she seems to have initiated a certain Demon Lord special communication line to inform the rest of the Demon Lords about my participation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems like some sort of high-level skill that could communicate through the interference of space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I observe her looking impressed for a while, and at the moment, someone walks towards me while laughing loudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s Veldora. It seems that he&rsquo;s finished with his manga and has been listening to our conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gahahahaha! Yes, you are finally taking things seriously! Although you&#39;re not being a good friend, Rimuru, bring me along as well! You don&rsquo;t have to worry about those Demon Lords at all with my company!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He makes such proud statement in full confidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of that, I&rsquo;ve completely forgotten about the fact that he&rsquo;s here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I don&rsquo;t plan to bring Veldora along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh well, don&rsquo;t get ahead of yourself now, Veldora. I hope you can stay in the town and focus on defense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nani! Wasn&rsquo;t I supposed to be going along too? Take my words, I won&rsquo;t lose to those Demon Lords at all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With my words, Veldora received a huge surprise, probably not expecting that I would say this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Defending this town is also an important mission, perhaps the most important task.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are marching all of our forces to take a final stand against Clayman. There will only be the police force led by Rigur present back here, whose numbers are pretty small, as well as Shion&rsquo;s subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The strategy is based on the precondition that Veldora remained here to defend the town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the Western Saints Church is to send out invasion force, Veldora alone should be able to handle them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;That&rsquo;s how it is, so I hope you can stay back for the defense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uhh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seems unable to accept it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can&rsquo;t be helped, I guess I&rsquo;ll tell him the real reason&mdash;I was just about to speak up before Ramiris, who finished the communication, begins to shout.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Rimuru! They&rsquo;ve approved your participation, but aren&rsquo;t you being too mean here? It will be okay if I have master to participate as my companion (underling). It&rsquo;s safer for me as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, with that being said it does sound reasonable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But from my perspective, Ramiris&rsquo; intention is crystal clear. She&rsquo;s trying to bring Veldora and Beretta there to brag.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think Veldora has also seen through her&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;huh, no? I don&rsquo;t want to go as you bodyguard at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He rejects without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;AWH REALLY&mdash;&#65281;EHHHH how could this&hellip; You are so cruel, master!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mean, what&rsquo;s with this master thing about Veldora&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris and Veldora seemed to have grown a friendship because of manga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s certain that the two have good relationship, but in terms of their power, it seems Ramiris is one-sidedly trying to get on good term with Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s a good thing anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our focus should be us participating in the Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For some of the Demon Lords, they may find it more troublesome to go around human towns. But that&rsquo;s just to my advantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Veldora, we&rsquo;ve been intentionally releasing fake news about you. You should know about that from the meeting we just finished.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It could have been a way to have him follow Ramiris as a servant. But honestly, I think it would lower the guards of the other Demon Lords to make them think that Veldora didn&#39;t follow along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, Hmmhmm, of course I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, it seems he doesn&rsquo;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And he is pretending that he paid attention to the meeting. He must have gotten addicted to reading manga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it&rsquo;s then much easier now to make up stories for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Besides, Clayman must be thinking that the Majin Rimuru is a bluffing scum who relies on Veldora&rsquo;s name&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What! That bastard Clayman, we&rsquo;ll see about it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&hellip; this ignorant bug, I shall go myself to personally take him out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahhh, calm down you guys. Rimuru-sama is just giving an example.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was halfway through my sentence before Shion and Diablo started acting all angry in my stead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You guys really can&rsquo;t keep your cool now, can you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was a bit mad for a moment, but since the other two spoke first, he got to regain his composure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get riled up now, Benimaru&rsquo;s right, that was just an example. Anyway, if we bring Veldora to the meeting and cause them to be on alert, wouldn&rsquo;t it be pointless?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand now, sasuga Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gufufufufu, anyone who dares to insult Rimuru-sama is unforgivable. I wanted to exterminate him by my own hands, but perhaps I shall allow Shion senpai perform the act instead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you want to lead the opponent into lowering their guard in order to drive the negotiation in our favor, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora who realizes my point nod and says so while Shion praises without using her brain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo is again making some dangerous statement, but he does think the best candidate to take down Clayman in this case is Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru looks quite happy having read my thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, shouldn&rsquo;t we try to avoid danger?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna asks me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her comment seems to have resonated with others as Geld and Gabiru nods in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if you are considered by the enemies as an individual to be cautious of, should you not perhaps focus on your personal safety?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Says Hakurou to me with Souei agreeing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, I can see where everyone&rsquo;s worries are coming from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, I&rsquo;ve also assessed that part.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I can use my skill &lsquo;Storm Dragon Summon&rsquo; to call out Veldora at any time. That wouldn&rsquo;t count as a companion to the meeting, right? That&rsquo;s why, since I can seek help at any point I wish, I hope you will defend the town quietly before that happens.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I said so proudly with a face as if saying &ldquo;How about that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My companions all seemed very impressed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;GA&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;HAHAHA! So I am actually the Hero for the finale.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora is feeling good about himself again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as you don&rsquo;t object, I won&rsquo;t say a thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cunning&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris pouts by herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Baka, Ramiris. You should praise me for being so smart.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris is still upset while Veldora whispers to himself &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I take the chance to bring up one more thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Besides, now you&rsquo;ve got an extra spot for a companion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing this, the Ramiris&rsquo; eyes along with the rest of my companions begin to glow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know me too well, Rimuru! Very well, who are you sending in as my servant?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris seems satisfied with her servant number increased to two. Given how she looks now, she&rsquo;s really just trying to show off to other Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyhow, it&rsquo;s alright as long as she accepts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One more spot&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I realize that everyone who hasn&rsquo;t been selected has been looking at me nervously, however, this servant must be strong enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I am being honest, Benimaru is the best choice, but the war can&rsquo;t be fought while I am not present, so Benimaru has to make up for it. Thus I have to select someone else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Which would mean&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry to keep everyone waiting, I choose Haku&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please hold on a second!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone interrupted me as I was halfway through nominating Hakurou. It was the woman standing behind Ramiris&mdash;Treyni-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, please allow me to take this mission no matter what&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Treyni, what a stubborn child!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris also looks delighted with her eyes soaking in tears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can&rsquo;t be helped then, I&rsquo;ll choose her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fine. Then we will go on with Treyni-san&rsquo;s aid.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I announce so, agreeing to the participation of Treyni-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, the members participating the Walpurgis Banquet are settled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My companions are Shion and Ranga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Ramiris&rsquo; companions are Beretta and Treyni-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And our trump card is summoning Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s my luck that the Demon Lords have approved my participation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I may even meet Leon Cromwell, one of the Demon Lord whom I have grudges against.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this time I&rsquo;ll first be checking out just what kind of a person he really is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I still carry and am unable to deal with Shizu-san&rsquo;s dying wish and I cannot just leave it like that, but this time my target is Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The riot caused by Orc Lord is still fresh in my memory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As well as the ordeal with Myuran.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most importantly, I am worried about Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we aren&rsquo;t careful, we would end up fighting Milim. I&rsquo;ve long made up my mind to take a final stand against Clayman, but if it&rsquo;s Milim, there is no way we can win&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I must utilize the opportunity well and have Clayman duel me.

Perhaps they had all planned to clarify the matter during the Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But by that time, the dust will already be settled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman has already planned everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He intends to buy some time before the Walpurgis Banquet to awaken as a &ldquo;True Demon Lord&rdquo; and receive its immense power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now Milim is in his hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the rest of the Demon Lords see him controlling Milim, they won&rsquo;t dare to say a thing about Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s how he sees it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why failure is not an outcome in this operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He needs to finish it quickly before the other Demon Lords decide to intervene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman has also prepared another argument, just in case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is to expose the cause of this military operation overall&mdash;that is, the violation of the pact by Demon Lord Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has taken actions to collect evidence to support his case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With all of these preparations, Clayman decides to play his cards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He will send the army out through Milim&rsquo;s domain to invade Beast Kingdom Yuurazania.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The role of commanding officer is given to Clayman&rsquo;s loyal servant Yamza.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He knows of Clayman&rsquo;s true intent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To achieve the goal of slaying more than ten thousand souls before the Walpurgis Banquet.

What did they mean by &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cooperate&rdquo;? Don&rsquo;t underestimate us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A bold, strong man shouts angrily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the city for people who worship the dragon</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c1">. This man is the high priest of the temple in the city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His name is Midley. He is the leader of those who worship Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But Midley-sama, if we don&rsquo;t follow orders now, we&rsquo;ll really suffer. Didn&rsquo;t that commander named Yamza had a written order from Milim-sama herself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A servant hissing with a smile says to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His name is Hermes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is the close servant and assistant to high priest Midley, being a member of the priest group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s always rather carefree and casual, so he may get easily categorized as the pretentious type of person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley shouts out furiously in response, seemingly pissed off by Hermes&rsquo; attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up Hermes. I don&rsquo;t need you to tell me what I already know too well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes, being scolded harshly and seeing Midley so worked up, feels internally rather helpless in return.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That being said, he can relate to why Midley has become so enraged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason is that the Majin group that was loitering within their borders since yesterday suddenly invaded this place&mdash;The Lost City of Dragon, and somehow built a camp here as if it is their own home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They appear to be working for Demon Lord Clayman and are marching towards Demon Lord Karion&rsquo;s territory to investigate his violation of the pact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They couldn&rsquo;t have said no, even if they wanted to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though Midley is still furious, they genuinely can&rsquo;t do anything about their situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there is also a reason for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It also happens that the person who decimated the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania of Demon Lord Karion is also the one they worship, Demon Lord Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since it&rsquo;s related to their master, naturally they had to facilitate the gathering of evidence by Clayman&rsquo;s men. Or rather, if they couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence, it would only cause disadvantages for Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Milim probably won&rsquo;t give a damn about it. It has however caused a big headache for people such as Hermes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For real though, Milim-sama sure is troubling&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Her stubbornness is truly something else. They deeply hope that Milim-sama can change a bit&mdash;</span><span class="c2 c16">even if it&rsquo;s really just a little</span><span class="c1">&mdash;to at least think for them. Hermes thinks to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That would be most disrespectful, Hermes! You cannot doubt Milim-sama&rsquo;s actions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, you are right but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">It&rsquo;s all because you spoiled her so much that I&rsquo;m getting more and more work every day.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hermes thinks to himself. But he can&rsquo;t say that since it will only enrage Midley more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">But we are in some serious trouble this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He complains to himself and starts recalling the suffering they have been through.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though they are aware that the army would be requesting to pass through the land, their attitudes are decidedly arrogant in a way that really leaves a bad taste in the residents&rsquo; mouths.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The army didn&rsquo;t pay any recognition to the Worshipers of Dragon at all and simply felt that their assistance is only natural at the time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their request is no different from orders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The City of Lost Dragon where the Worshipers of Dragon reside has a population of less than a hundred thousand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It does not contain any functions of a nation. The citizens help each other out and live together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were able to live peacefully under the protection of Demon Lord Milim without much military power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least that&rsquo;s what those who are aware of this country usually think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this understanding is only 50% correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, they don&rsquo;t possess much political clout.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be specific, everyone contributes their earnings to the central temple for the high priest to redistribute equally. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, one would think there will be lazy people that will undermine the system, but in reality, it&rsquo;s different. The hard-working and the lazy get basic financial compensation. But apart from that, the hard-working people get to enjoy an additional bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we compare it to modern-day Japan, it will be the system where everyone has the basic welfare to ensure one&rsquo;s living.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The issue with this system lies mainly on those who decide on the amount of compensation the people are given. However&hellip; Milim has allowed Midley to handle everything in the area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is why he holds such authority that may even determine life or death. However, Midley has never abused it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason for this is also simple: the assistant priest of Midley has the rights to abolish him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he ever becomes tyrannical and exploits his authority for his own desires, he will lose all of his status. Midley knows this very well and that&rsquo;s why he never became a tyrant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in truth, Milim has already taken the seat of a legitimate tyrant, so no one dares to imitate her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Due to the reasons above, the thousands of worshippers are surprisingly united.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides that, there is another reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The belief held by the outside world that these people lack combat abilities&hellip; is a complete misunderstanding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For some reason, the worshippers of Dragon are all individually equipped with strong physical capabilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from their unity and discipline, an adult worshipper&rsquo;s power is close to Rank C.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that they are all pacifistic is not nearly as remarkable when acknowledging that they are, in fact, a difficult organization to handle that favors martial strength. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The priests possess even greater power than the rest. The evidence is that there&rsquo;s only around a hundred party members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every member is an elite and a force to be reckoned with. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every day they pray to Milim&mdash;in forms of combat training&mdash;As a result, their combat capabilities are extraordinary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Among them, Midley and Hermes can even request Milim as their sparring partner&mdash; that is how strong they both are. But even so, Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates still looked down to them all, which genuinely pissed them off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, there&rsquo;s a bigger secret that they&rsquo;ve kept.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Which is&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The day after that,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates took the worshippers&rsquo; food from their warehouse without permission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley&rsquo;s face is gradually bursting with his veins due to his anger, but he endured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, why hasn&rsquo;t Milim-sama returned?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley asks, mainly in order to distract himself from his fury.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Only god would know, but why did you ask&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes makes a random response. They&rsquo;ve repeated this Q&amp;A over a dozen times and the longer it goes, the more annoyed Hermes feels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve prepared a great feast just for her&hellip; Could Milim-sama be suffering of hunger at some place?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-No way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes asserts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s quite certain about the. Since the &ldquo;great feast&rdquo; Midley refers to is a large vegetable dish named &ldquo;The Platter of Nature&rsquo;s Gifts&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s raw by the way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes secretly observed Milim&rsquo;s expression when he&rsquo;d dined with her when eating it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had no expression on her face, nor any emotional response. All she did was chewing.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 563.00px; height: 810.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 563.00px; height: 810.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">No way was that a great feast. She didn&rsquo;t appear to enjoy it one bit; or rather she looked as if she was trying her hardest to endure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes is certain of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When they&rsquo;d served the roast meat, Milim had looked quite happy eating it, that was rather obvious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then when Hermes proposed this to Midley &ldquo;We should serve her cooked meal before the vegetables. Milim-sama would be very happy to have it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He got turned down with his suggestion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley believes the direct ingestion of the rich products of nature would be the best serving&mdash;And so, Hermes was unable to change Midley&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">This is why Milim-sama seldomly comes here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes really wants to speak his mind, but he&rsquo;s in a disadvantageous position right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has travelled through different countries and experienced delicious cuisines. In comparison, no other priests have had this kind of experience. Everyone believes the best food is always the natural ones. They will reject his proposal so long as they maintain this mindset. That&rsquo;s why Hermes decided to give up on this matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? That would be good then. But how dare that Clayman act all presumptuous and force Milim-sama to write an order&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The handwriting is terrible&mdash;Correction, the handwriting on the order is uniquely intriguing, it&rsquo;s definitely Milim&rsquo;s writing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re forced to follow the order. But still, there&rsquo;s a bottom line.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, we had to comply because of Milim-sama&rsquo;s order&hellip;but now the third granary has also been emptied. That leaves seven left, we are gonna have a hard time until the next harvest&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damnit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley&rsquo;s veins bursts on his bald head like a hami melon. You can tell with one look just how much fury he holds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes, who happens across this scene, finds it quite funny. He can only note that Midley is somewhat mentally unstable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in that instant, the source of their anger enters their sights&mdash;Clayman army&rsquo;s commander walking towards them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;*Smacks lips* ! Hermes, we need to endure for now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s my line&mdash;Hermes thinks as he answers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hopes that guy will just pass them by, but unfortunately the man makes a beeline towards Hermes and the rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both of them stop talking to wait for the man&mdash;Yamza, to approach them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza is the commanding officer of Clayman&rsquo;s army and it wouldn&rsquo;t be a lie to say that he is Clayman&rsquo;s right hand man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looks rather light for his medium build and is the type of fighter who focuses on speed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or rather, a swordsman. He is a top swordsman with swiftness beyond the wind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is equipped with the specially crafted Magic Frost Sword, gifted by Clayman. It can cast the elemental-based magic &ldquo;Great Storm of Ice and Water&rdquo; without chanting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Magic Swordsman of Frost, Yamza&mdash;The A+ Majin who wields both sword and magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehe, how are you, Midley-dono? Thank you for your support with rations; it really helped a lot. After all, I have thirty-thousand people to take care of here. No small amount of food could suffice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza hangs a caring smile, yet such joyful expression is absent in his eyes. Instead, they are observing Midley&rsquo;s reaction carefully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t even bother to acknowledge Hermes&rsquo; presence with a glance. This is the usual attitudes for Majins who look down on human.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This truly makes him feel uncomfortable. But Hermes has to endure under Midley&rsquo;s order. There is no pointing arguing with Yamza anyway, so he will endure for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ha-ha-ha. What an honor for us to assist you. However, we really aren&rsquo;t able to continue this favor. If our people are to suffer famine, Milim-sama would be very sad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What nonsense is this! That Demon Lord Milim acted on her and now my army has to clean up her mess. Besides, isn&rsquo;t it only natural for you to maintain the friendship between our masters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza became furious with just two lines of response from Midley. No, his anger is an act. He&rsquo;s trying to see Midley&rsquo;s response to his pretended fury.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Midley is to lose his temper and argues back, Yamza would exploit this matter and burn down the city. It is quite obvious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah ah, my apology. I accidentally had some selfish thoughts. We&rsquo;ll help you with everything we&rsquo;ve got, so please don&rsquo;t be generous with us and speak up your mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to quench Yamza&rsquo;s anger, Midley bows his body and bow to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes feels immense respect towards Midley having witnessed this. After all, Yamza has already revealed his true intent yet Midley did not even show a sign of anger on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He simply smiled and replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Impressive, sasuga Midley-sama. Now his head doesn&rsquo;t look like a homi melon at all. If it&rsquo;s me I&rsquo;d lose my temper already.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes thinks to himself, but then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? But I was expecting that. But since there is no issue for us to wipe out the Beast Kingdom alone, we want to gift you with the opportunity to assist us. Would it pose any problem if you are to handle the transportation of our resources?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza gives off an evil smirk after finishing his words and caused Hermes to argue back unconsciously. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-wait a second! It&rsquo;s enough that you rob our food, now you want to take out labor as well&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t intend to resist. He simply slipped his thought out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Immediately after, Hermes feels tremendous pain flowing from his left hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;AHHHHH!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut your mouth, human trash!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza squeezes his eyes ruthlessly. His cold eyes meet with Hermes&rsquo; for the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes bites his teeth hard and stares back at Yamza while holding onto his severed hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Ho, aren&rsquo;t you the rebel? Looks like you are begging me to finish you off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza gives off a cruel smile and points his blood-stained sword towards Hermes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">You bastard, don&rsquo;t get ahead of yourself&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes wants to shout with fury, yet he was hit by a strong impact force as if he&rsquo;s been crashed by a beast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was from a kick.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley initiated a powerful kick against Hermes&rsquo; abdomen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haha, we are truly sorry for the continuous offense, Yamza-sama. I&rsquo;ll scold this idiot myself and educate him better in the future. Please forgive him for my sake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley bows and pleads towards Yamza.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh. It&rsquo;s so hard to look after moronic subordinates. I&rsquo;ll let you off the hook this time. We are setting off tomorrow morning. All of you priest should go and prepare yourselves!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thanks to Midley&rsquo;s intervention was the situation salvaged and Yamza sheathed his sword. However, it came at a heavy price. The leaders that are the priest of the Worshippers of Dragons has been forced into conscription. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza left with the line and walked away without a care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They weren&rsquo;t planning to conscript the worshippers to war, but only the priests who are capable of restoration magic. And because Hermes couldn&#39;t restrain himself, it went the way Yamza wanted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Yamza left, Midley begins to heal Hermes while sighing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You idiot, didn&rsquo;t I just tell you to stay quiet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t help myself and&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes holds tight onto his severed hand as Midley applies treatment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the effect of holy magic &ldquo;Healing Sickness&rdquo;, Hermes&rsquo; hand is restored to its original shape. But he&rsquo;s not feeling quite well after losing too much blood. But since Hermes would later apply &ldquo;Stamina Regeneration&rdquo; on himself, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. At least the people won&rsquo;t have to suffer for now at the cost of the Priest group. Speaking of which, that man&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The suppressed anger of his now write all over Midley&rsquo;s face as he stares viciously towards the direction Yamza left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;he dares to harm the properties of Milim-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s talking about Yamza cutting off Hermes&rsquo; hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley expresses his anger towards such unforgivable violent acts, yet he&rsquo;s acting oblivious towards kicking Hermes just now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Hold on a second, your iron kick was quite deadly too&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But all in all, Hermes knew Midley didn&rsquo;t mean any harm, so he won&rsquo;t complain about it. After all, Midley is Milim&rsquo;s follower, he&rsquo;s just as simple-minded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, not only Midley, it&rsquo;s what the entire nation is like&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, that&rsquo;s right, can I kill him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Idiot, you are no match for him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The proposal is instantly rejected, but Midley has a point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Midley just said, Hermes has no chance against Yamza.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right I suppose. That sword is rather difficult to deal with, and the man seems to have concealed other secrets as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, no wonder that asshole is Clayman&rsquo;s right hand man. He won&rsquo;t show his strength if not required. But a man should fight justly&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, that sounds really stupid you know&mdash;Hermes thinks to himself. But his thought is not mainstream in this country at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is forced to agree, then returned to finish his work. The sudden change of plan to set off tomorrow leaves a lot of business to pile up for him to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The morning of the other day soon follows&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Walpurgis Banquet will be held two days later, Clayman&rsquo;s army is again, commencing its invasion operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The meeting is over and it&rsquo;s the next day&rsquo;s morning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t get much sleep last night, so I&rsquo;m feeling the drowsiness. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that&rsquo;s just mental tiredness, I&rsquo;m in fact more lively than ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t have to sleep, which makes things convenient for me during time like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei contacted me after yesterday&rsquo;s meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His real self came for the meeting but his clones made from &ldquo;Shadow Clone&rdquo; have been travelling in the border of the Beast Kingdom to help him collect intel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei&rsquo;s five subordinates including Souka have been quite active as well, helping us collecting many intelligences.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman&rsquo;s army that we&rsquo;ve been on guard against has not made a move yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They&rsquo;ve been looking for appropriate locations to deploy our army. A question arose, however.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Beast Kingdom residents seeking refuge have been spread across the place. In order to rescue them, we seem to run short on time whichever direction we decide to march towards. The attacking route taken by Clayman has put us in disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;There is a solution. Transport the refugees to a specific location altogether. This would improve the efficiency.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, I see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm, indeed it&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is not as if the army is the only viable subjects of teleportation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could utilize &ldquo;Dimension Domination&rdquo; to teleport wherever I want, so I can instantly teleport towards the locations of Souei&rsquo;s clones, Souka and the rest. There I can open a new &ldquo;Teleportation&rdquo; to transport and gather the refugees to a specific location.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s how it is, now I&rsquo;ve got more work to do after the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I need to send Geld&rsquo;s troop first to build up camp for the refugees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The destination of the teleportation is the capital of Beast Kingdom, which has been wiped out by Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The location has become a wide plain of wasteland which makes it extra eye-catching. However, it&rsquo;s perfectly suitable to accommodate a huge army. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After I&rsquo;ve inspected the gatherings and transport the refugees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve finished transporting everyone last night, which is why I&rsquo;m worn out at the moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;With that being said, it&rsquo;s still just tiredness in the mental level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luckily, I had Phobio by my side so the refugees weren&rsquo;t resisting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Phobio was worn out by it as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon departing he even said: &ldquo;Why do you seem so carefree with all these continuous teleportations&hellip;? And these types of massive scale teleportation magic&hellip; This is just too much&mdash;&rdquo;and he looked at me like some sort of monster, what a rude guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course I am tired as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this way, Geld has built the marching tents for the war. The exhausted Phobio is now resting in one of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, yeah, Phobio is not the point of discussion here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our army needs to get prepared as well. I&rsquo;ve got to send them off with glory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I move to the plaza that has yet to be completed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was prepared by Rigurdo overnight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he worked all night like me, he&rsquo;s still running around with livelihood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I should call Rigurdo back and let him go assist Geld.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And speaking of work, I still have to send the people here to the camp at Beast Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When all of these are settled, I&rsquo;ll need to think through the details in preparations for the Walpurgis Banquet the day after tomorrow. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After arriving at the plaza, I see the soldiers have been waiting there already in order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are the ten-thousand Beastmen army led by the Beastketeers&mdash;Suphia and Alvis. The units don&rsquo;t really have standard issued equipment, but it can&rsquo;t really be helped. Since their equipment are spares ones from us that have been abandoned due to their repair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And most of the beastmen are also capable of &ldquo;Beastilization&rdquo;, so it is much more convenient than having them wear a full set of armor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My subordinates are listed along with them to travel as reinforcement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As compared to our battle against Charybdis, their scale and combat abilities have all increased greatly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru discovered that I&rsquo;ve arrived and came standing next to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems he has caught the chance to explain to me about everyone&rsquo;s evolution condition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Following my evolution, everyone also experienced changes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Voice Of the world&rdquo; mentioned that it will gift blessings to monsters with connections to my soul and those monsters that are named by me seem to fall under that category.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to the survey around the town, they seem to have experienced significant changes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here is what Benimaru said:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;After the survey with the town folks we got the following results, the male constituents have gained more stamina and strength while the female constituents&rsquo; skins became smoother, plus their appearance become more beautiful. I don&rsquo;t really care about that point&mdash;no actually, this may sound pretty weird, but their vitality seems to have increased&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was able to update me on the condition of the residents as everyone else is moving in formation. Some people seem to have transform younger in appearance. Everyone is very grateful about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they are all non-combatants. So they only need to watch over the town this time instead of the joining the march.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let&rsquo;s talk about the main combat forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some combatants have gained skills, and since every corp has their unique features, the skills they gained seem range all over the place as they were assigned them based on the features of their combat unit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m really looking forward to seeing them in action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now let&rsquo;s check on the veteran forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Goblin riders unit is under the leadership of Captain Gobta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are Hobgoblins who ride the star wolf race which requires a certain set of conditions to trigger the evolution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Are they really Hobgoblins?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their race is indeed Hobgoblin, but their nature doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit under the race.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These guys seemed to have gained a rare skill, Extra Skill &ldquo;Unification&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This skill is not just a simple metaphor for the rider and its ride, but it&rsquo;s in fact a real merger skill. In order words, once the skill &ldquo;Unification&rdquo;is activated, they would become powerful fighter that runs at high speed on four legs. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their combined strength after unification is approximately Rank A.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ability is specialized in battling a single enemy, that&rsquo;s why its combat rank does not reach Rank A. But with that being said, its combat ability is still outstanding. If several groups of its users fight together, they may stand a chance against a Rank A majin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the goblin riders are good at teamwork.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are most reliable in high speed communication and on top of that, have endured much harsh training. After all, they&rsquo;ve been personally trained (fucked) by Hakurou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One can imagine the horrifying sight of such a corp being mobilized in group of hundreds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are likely very different from the combat rank assigned by the humans, so I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to the performance of these fighters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And up next are Benimaru&rsquo;s subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since I&rsquo;ve become the leader of Jura Forest, the combat capabilities of these monsters have increased drastically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Especially the Ogre race that have around three hundred personals. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ones with impressive fighting capabilities among them are all young lads who were born from the village that sought help from me initially. They seem to have been blessed with evolution due to their admiration for Benimaru and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s really quite surprising.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some of them joined in voluntarily, among them joined as named fighter already. Their strength can rival that of Lower Majin, which make them quite reliable fighters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The wild, unintelligent ogre has already reached Rank B before they joined. And now they are all equipped well and have learnt skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No way they aren&rsquo;t strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">These people formed Benimaru&rsquo;s personal bodyguards, named &ldquo;Kurenai&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a combat group with individual strength up to Rank A-.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now let&rsquo;s see the constituents of the vanguards led by Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are roughly four thousand hobgoblins who have all undergone intriguing evolution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They&rsquo;ve gained &ldquo;Flame Control&rdquo;and &ldquo;Heat Change Resistance&rdquo;, therefore turning into elemental fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A rather surprising change.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their individual rank is B, the same as the special attack force that focuses on strong attack power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And since all of these hobgoblins have green skins, all of their names are related to green.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone to name them with these names, I really hope he&rsquo;d had a better vision for the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. Master was the one who named them.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I know already! </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t believe someone would tease me. So annoying!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s really because I didn&rsquo;t think that much in the past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The evolution of monster is truly amazing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And since the members are all named after the color green, the corp&rsquo;s name is also named the Green Corps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Life is all about being simplistic~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since it was Benimaru&rsquo;s subordinates, I wanted to use red as their&rsquo;s but green is profound in its own way. The members all have fire attacks unlike the color of their skins. It should create a surprise for the opponents, so it would do just fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I need to dye their equipment green as well and give them chances to display their strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And further down I saw Geld&rsquo;s troops that have formed two lines of wall with the Green Corps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The orcs&rsquo; evolution also came in group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone obtained Extra Skill &ldquo;Superhuman Strength&rdquo; and &ldquo;Iron Wall&rdquo; which serve to fortify their bodies. The captains additionally the Extra Skill &ldquo;Earth Manipulation&rdquo; that enables them to manipulate soil at will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are the new skills Geld mentioned before. They seem to be very useful in the mass-production of trenches. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And everyone also gained Extra Skill &ldquo;Full-Body Fortification&rdquo; that makes the corp structure to focus on defense capabilities. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Furthermore, they&rsquo;ve inherited most of my resistance. Besides &ldquo;Physical Attack Resistance&rdquo;, they also gained &ldquo;Pain/Corrosion/Electricity/Paralysis Resistance&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The complete version of the shield that I gifted to Cabal once, the Charybdis Scale Shield has been crafted to achieve special grade in terms of quality and possess defense capability against Magic. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, they can now resist both physical and magical attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also genuinely considered helping them gain poison resistance with Shion&rsquo;s cooking&hellip; But I should probably give up that though&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sigh, if only could I get another batch of Charybdis scales. Garm has finished processing the final product so Kurobe could replicate them in large quantities. I really appreciate these professional craftsmen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now we are able to turn them into a strong corp with individual rank reaching B. If all of its members can special grade equipment, they would easily surpass the standards of a normal army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They can be said to be an overpowered corp of defensive force. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has five thousand members in total.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with more and more volunteers joining, the number continues to grow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They would handle construction projects in daily lives and turn into a strong legion if encounter any emergency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who are capable of resisting all sorts of attack that can be said to be the legion of Iron Wall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;The Yellow Corps, would be the official name of this legion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Behind them are the some hundred dragonoids led by Gabiru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Dragonoids already possesses very high racial attributes. And it is natural that they are up to Rank A.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With my blessings, the blood of dragon has been awakened more thoroughly. They&rsquo;ve gained the intrinsic skill of &ldquo;Dragon Warrior Conversion&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They also get to choose either &ldquo;Black Flame Fog&rdquo; or &ldquo;Black Lightning Fog&rdquo;, and thus gained an additional range attack ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabiru is able to use both skills, very impressive!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so I&rsquo;m only not sure about what &ldquo;Dragon Warrior Conversion&rdquo; is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. Intrinsic Skill &ldquo;Dragon Warrior Conversion&rdquo; is&mdash;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, no need to explain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I already know I can&rsquo;t use that skill, so there&rsquo;s no use hearing the explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I just hope that they would be able to use this skill well. But I trust Gabiru and the rest would work hard on their own to figure out the skills themselves. There&rsquo;s no point in gaining power without hard work. Or at least that&rsquo;s how I see it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eh, so what about me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have the ultimate skill &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll be fine against any challenge with the aid of Raphael.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raphael is my power, so in some sense, it is the equivalent of me working very hard. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable to say I&rsquo;ve not slacked one bit in terms of effort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that would be it. I hope Gabiru-kun and his partners could learn to use that skill well before the next crisis strike! Even though it&rsquo;s a bit irresponsible on my part, I still hope they would work hard on it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just saying, but what a waste it is for these subordinates to serve Gabiru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are all able to fly, making their fog attack from the sky hard to defend against.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their racial attributes granted them many innate resistances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were born with hardened scale that&rsquo;s hard as steel and equips chest piece crafted with magical steel. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Weaker attack, whether with sword or magic won&rsquo;t be able to pierce through it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They have an overwhelming advantage already given their flying capability and now they also get the body of defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are the assault squad possessing the trinity of speed, attack and defense. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So I&rsquo;ve officially named them &ldquo;Hiryuu&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They only have around hundred members, yet they are the strongest troop in our nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ones standing in the last row are the newly appointed troops.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These troops are my personal bodyguards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the one leading them is Shion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Structurally, it consists around a hundred members who were all previously resurrected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some of them used to be children and they were able to age quickly to their adolescence. There&rsquo;s no doubt that their regrets of not being able to fight back during the riot has prompted them to evolve&hellip; They gained the following skills, Extra Skill &ldquo;Perfect Memory&rdquo; and &ldquo;Automatic Regeneration&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two skills accommodate each other well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since they have &ldquo;Perfect Memory&rdquo;, even if their head gets blown off, their memory would still remain intact in their astral body. And as long as they activate &ldquo;Automatic Regeneration&rdquo; during this period, they would be able to save themselves with the possibility of getting revived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be honest, they&rsquo;ve gained the impressive regenerative ability that was also displayed by the Orc Disaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now if they somehow evolved &ldquo;Automatic Regeneration&rdquo; to &ldquo;Super Regeneration&rdquo;, they would almost have an unkillable body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are in total a hundred of them. But it&rsquo;s honestly rather repulsive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from that, they&rsquo;ve become quite arrogant having obtained fierce speed of regeneration and are able to survive Shion&rsquo;s hellish special training at ease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, someone even said &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to worry about it since we won&rsquo;t die!&rdquo;. it came from a little girl who was just a kid recently&hellip; I&rsquo;m really speechless towards that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not sure if I should scold her or encourage her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now they are only around Rank C, but I have a feeling that they would become the strongest unit in our nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The troops&rsquo; name is &ldquo;Shikokushu&rdquo;&#65288;Yomigaeri &#34311;&#12426;&#65289;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shikoku&rdquo; has the meaning of overcoming death; it will be a good match to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that&rsquo;s about it, the above is all of the report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the changes brought by my evolution as well as their own efforts afterward, they have achieved fruitful results and made a magnificent display of their strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, I thought they&rsquo;ve only gained some combat capabilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet now this army with less than ten thousand soldiers can easily take down those standard army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are greatly outnumbered by the Farmus army I eliminated, yet their abilities are far above them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ehh, what a surprising result from the report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their only weakness is their small number, I&rsquo;d have to slowly increase after assessing our national power carefully. But ten thousand should be sufficient for a standing army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, there are still reserved forces in the town that are responsible for defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is a troop assembled by the residents of the Jura Great Forest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The difference is still too large, so I didn&rsquo;t allow them to join in the battle. But it&rsquo;s possible to turn them into a combat force after more trainings in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That matter would have to wait for another day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This concludes the report brought by Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, it&rsquo;s quite a majestic sight when all ten thousand subordinates are lined up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are also ten thousand Beastmen warriors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two armies with a total of twenty thousand personnel quietly await their moment to march.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shikokushu&rdquo; are acting now as my personal bodyguards, so I&rsquo;ve told to stay out of the army for now. Instead they would be watching over their base this time, so it would only lead to nuisances if they line up along the rest. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, everything is ready.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rigurdo arrives and reports to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I really need to thank him for ordering all these without rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Rigurdo would respond &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too kind of you&mdash;&rdquo;and gives a satisfied smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alright, the preparation is done. It&rsquo;s time for some &ldquo;Teleportation&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, Alvis-san&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can call me Alvis, Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis responded to me like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I was hoping to act more politely, but it did the opposite effect and caused her to panic. I suppose I would be more straight-forward then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, Alvis. We&rsquo;ve gathered all of your companions in the other side, please inform them of the results of our meeting. I&rsquo;d bet Phobio is formatting the troops there, so I&rsquo;ll leave the rest to you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood. We will never forget your kindness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis bows deeply to me, followed by Suphia as well as the rest of the Beastmen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I got the sudden pressure of having forced others into submission. But I endured my feelings, after all, these are gestures of their gratitude. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama has helped us so much. Now we can be relieved of our concerns and beat the crap out of Clayman&rsquo;s people. Please allow us to resolve your grievances with Clayman in your place!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia says so and laughs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What a beauty indeed, but her expression is quite scary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis seems to agree to her along those words and also shows a scary expression with killing aura all over the place. The two seem to be saying that they are all hyped up for the havoc they are going to cause.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are twenty thousand Beastmen in total, perhaps they don&rsquo;t really need reinforcement&hellip; Actually, the more the people the better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we consider their army alone, they would still lose to Clayman&rsquo;s army in terms of number.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the addition of my reinforcement, the united army reaches thirty thousand men like Clayman&rsquo;s army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have the same number of soldiers and the advantage of higher quality of soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem is however&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right Benimaru, is there any problem with the attack plan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve run around for the entire yesterday to gather all the Beastmen and had Benimaru showed them the attack plan again. There were no major changes, but if I take out the part concerning the refugee groups that were distracting the enemies, some modifications to the details must be made.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, there is no problem. Since Clayman&rsquo;s target is the citizens of the Beast Kingdom, active retreats would definitely be effective, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru responds so with a smile that bears cunningness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm, I also think it&rsquo;s a good method. There is no need for them to clash head on and results in casualty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve discussed with Benimaru-san. Right now we still have time to switch battlefield, so we may commence our attack later&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alvis follows through as well while playing her golden khakkhara</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and begins to discuss the attack plan delightfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything seems alright.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Clayman couldn&rsquo;t get what he wanted before the Walpurgis Banquet, he would definitely take it out on his subordinate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if the commander gets desperate and begins to act recklessly in fear of Clayman&rsquo;s fury, we would really gain more advantage through it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;The troops would be allocated near the entrance of Jura Great Forest. That wasteland was once my hometown. Today it is the site of the fallen orc kingdom Obic, where my brethren are buried.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld says so almost with a hidden sentiment of hatred.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That kingdom was destroyed due to Clayman&rsquo;s conspiracy, and now it will be the location of the final battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The writing was on the wall all these times, could this be karma in work?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The attack plan is very simple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We will have the refugees pretending to escape into the Jura Great Forest and have our forces confront the pursuing enemies face-on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; has assisted me to perfectly simulate the battle scenario in my head. With the input of the information and descriptions given by Souei&rsquo;s party, I am able to create a sketch, that is very similar to the reality, of the blueprints of future events.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And through my &ldquo;Telepathy Net&rdquo;, I was able to transfer this information to everyone for their convenience in grasping the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We initially planned to bait the enemies while protecting the refugees to retreat, and then surround and eliminate them. And with the modification of the plan, the faster moving crowds will now act as baits. This has lowered the risks of individual party getting defeated. It is natural then that it will significantly increases the chances of success of the plan. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The key is to lure the enemies deep into the forest to eliminate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wasn&rsquo;t planning to kill them all, but to let some escape. But it would be troublesome if they regroup and fight back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suppose I&rsquo;ll do this one through and through.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru, you know what to do, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ll show them living hell so they&rsquo;ll never dare to have the thought of opposing us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru answers with a delightful smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, that is the expression of no mercy for enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kill them all, Benimaru!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu. If you don&rsquo;t take out the trash early, it may stink in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion and Diablo encourages Benimaru loud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Encouragement&mdash;The word seems mildly inappropriate here, but I digress.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those two also want to join the battle. They sure are war fanatic, but unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not happening this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion would stay along my side to prepare for the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo would set out later to conquer Farmus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is why they won&rsquo;t be able to take part in this battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll leave the rest to Benimaru and wait for the good news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, report to me immediately if anything happens. I&rsquo;ll send you guys in now; you must achieve victory!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;YES SIR&mdash;! WE SHALL ACHIEVE VICTORY FOR YOU!&rdquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Several lines of sights were laid on me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I glance through the crowds with my golden eyes and initiated the magic circle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve practiced this several times last night and grown quite familiar with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A giant magic circle appears on the ground where the twenty-thousand men army stands, and it begins to stack from bottom to top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are several layers of geometric patterns within the square that appeared, I can understand none of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It truly causes a lot of magicules and concentration trying to teleport twenty thousand men at the same time. My magicules are depleting gradually, but it seems sufficient when I count it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But with that being said, I&rsquo;ve stored up too much magicules.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Around five minutes passed since.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone has been standing still for the teleportation magic circle to be completed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterward, as the square travels above everyone&rsquo;s head, in an instant&mdash;A blinding bright light appears and the army disappears entirely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The teleportation has ended. It seems I&rsquo;ve successfully sent everyone away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, I got super scared initiating this for the first time last night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, it shone such a bright light at midnight. It got me all spooked worrying it might have been spotted by Clayman&rsquo;s army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After which I used smoke screening magic to cover up the light of the magic circle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything has a chance to fail, so I should never get careless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time there is no need to hide the light, so I get to witness the spectacle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sasuga Rimuru-sama, what a beautiful spell!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, its sight alone had me mesmerized!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo begins to praise me with Shion, unwilling to miss out, starting to flatter me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo seems to like magic a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps we will discuss more about magic after the dust is settled with the issue at hand. He may know some magic I&rsquo;ve never heard of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Shion, I need to be careful about her getting jealous of people around me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It will be really troublesome if she tries to mess with others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think so while nodding to the two, then proceed to leave the location.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After everyone has left, Veldora who seems to be bored come strolling to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After which he starts to make some idiot talks. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru, why don&rsquo;t you let me go beat the crap out of them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course this guy didn&rsquo;t hear a thing I said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you already! You need to keep your thing a secret before the Walpurgis Banquet! If you go on a rampage there, you will be exposing us right there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;GA&mdash;HAHA, oh yeah, there&rsquo;s that. I happened to forget about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;d better be!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mister Give me headache.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Would it work if I give him a bunch of more mangas beforehand?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m still concerned that he may mess something up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I gotta find someone to keep an eye on him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later this noon, Youmu and his party also went on their journey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve told them to chat a lot about the resurrection of Veldora on their way to Farmus. And also have them spread the news in all the villages to let the rumor spread out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason behind is very obvious, to let Clayman get hold of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I really hope this news reach him soon, I thought so as I sent them out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo told me: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll be right back. &ldquo;How low are you looking down on Farmus Kingdom? That actually caused me to worry about him. But I&rsquo;ll leave it to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone would encounter failure at some point, it won&rsquo;t be late to consider things when it happens.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, Gazel also returned to Dwargon. His ministers seem to have be furious so he went back in panic&hellip;Something must have gone wrong with his body double. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You could imagine that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I swear not to follow his footstep. So I need to plan everything perfectly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that thought circling in my mind, I saw Gazel off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another day passed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to the message sent by Benimaru, they were successfully teleported to their destination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean everything would be smooth-sailing onward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thirty-thousand men army as well as the refugee were very restricted in terms of movement. Even if they are all strong beastmen unlike humans and the arrival time to the destination won&rsquo;t be prolonged for long, still&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No need to worry, I&rsquo;ve already planned out solutions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just like that, I&rsquo;ve prepared the area for reception, so we can teleport the non-combatants back to the town in Tempest Federation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I pat on Benimaru&rsquo;s shoulder as I finish my sentence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh yeah&hellip; You can do that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru gives a look that says, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I realize that earlier&rdquo; and sighs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No no no, this type of teleportation spell would consume a lot of my magicules. And the more people there are the more magicules it costs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t have much strength left after teleporting the twenty thousand people yesterday. I can&rsquo;t spam the spell too much, so it hasn&#39;t been a waste of time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, this spell has some brand-new elements that may topple common senses. I would definitely come up with ways to actively exploit this in the battlefield. Furthermore considering that there are probably very few people who can cast this type of large scale magic, we thus will turn the table around and have the advantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyhow, after sending everyone off yesterday, Rigurdo has since finished preparing the location for the refugee to spend the night. So I only intend to teleport them back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s how it is, to teleport everyone back as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are also coping quite well. Those who are teleported back got used to it very quickly. No one showed any sign of distress, that&rsquo;s impressive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I told Rigurdo to lead everyone here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I can continue to work on a certain something left over from yesterday.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hope I could get this done on time with the Walpurgis Banquet and pray there wouldn&rsquo;t be any emergency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything has been smooth-sailing since and the day of Walpurgis Banquet has finally arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I finished the work at hand before lunch and enter the final stage after noon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I finally got a breath as I seem to have caught up in time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru, this is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about it, isn&rsquo;t it amazing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are a genius!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who are you by the way&hellip; to put my question aside, I don&rsquo;t have time with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I need to rest myself well for the night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why, Ramiris, I&rsquo;m gonna ignore your silly talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, I finished my lunch and entered the final stage of work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I put the finalized product in my &ldquo;Stomach&rdquo; and head to the Dryad residence where Treyni-san lives. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora also wanted to follow, but I told him to endure it for now. Although it&rsquo;s unlikely, I left him there in case the town goes under attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, the town of Tempest Federation is under the protection of Veldora&rsquo;s &ldquo;Barrier&rdquo;. It can also prevent Clayman&rsquo;s eavesdrop, but it will be problematic if the barrier is removed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I told him to bring him out next time, and I, Ramiris and Treyni-san set out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I feel kind of sorry for him, however, I did tell Beretta to stay with Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He definitely would be handled like a servant, so I also feel sorry for Beretta. I&rsquo;ve got to compensate him next time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like that, we activated &ldquo;Dimension Manipulation&rdquo; and changed location.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I arrive at the residence, I see the insect monster Apito and Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I first rescued Apito, it was around fifty centimeters long. Now it has grown healthily to fifty centimeters. It makes me happy seeing it is able to grow up healthily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other one, Zegion, has grown to around seventy centimeters. It seems to have grown quite strong now that the lower monster won&rsquo;t even dare to mess with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that no monster around here could beat Zegion, its strength is rather mysterious. I once told it to not be stubborn in battle, so he shouldn&rsquo;t have fought any uncertain battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion is aware of his limitation unlike Gobta or Gabiru who gets cocky every time they improve. Zegion is a very reliable individual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito happily approached us after discovering me and gifted me some hone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thanks, this is an amazing medicine! Knowing so, I gotta take a bite fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Honey is the perfect solution to smooth tiredness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As expected of the super rare and effective medicine that would cure anything illness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;R-Rimuru, wait up&mdash;no, Rimuru-san? I have something to ask you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris starts to ask me with an anxious tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;T-that insect, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a legion bee&hellip;right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No idea, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No idea... I mean, are you seriously&mdash;!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris is greatly shocked by it, so what if it is a legion bee?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, as that sama has mentioned, I am the highest ranked breed among the Legion Bees, the Queen Bee. If you so desire, shall I summon my subordinates?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh oh, that sounds cool. But there&rsquo;s no need for that right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can summon them when this residence is in danger. If you want to find your more of your companions, you can discuss that with Treyni-san and then summon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is no need. Then I won&rsquo;t summon them now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito flaps its wing and left happily with a &ldquo;Buzzzzz&rdquo; sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That buzz sound sounds both beautiful and cruel and seem to be able to cut people in half with just its sound. Could it be that the Legion Bees are some type of dangerous monster?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;N-no way, right? Apito has been collecting honey for me, how can it be dangerous?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides there is Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion bows to me in silence and follows Apito away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It really has some celebrity like style, resembling a lot to an insect king.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may even grow stronger and evolve. I&rsquo;ll invite him to be my subordinate by that time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I turn back to see Ramiris all speechless with Treyni-san comforting her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were right, it says it&rsquo;s a Legion bee. And it seems to be a queen as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I try to talk to Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I heard it too! Seriously, you&hellip;Uhh, never mind. Your ability seems to have no bound. Speaking of that, the other one also seems&hellip;no, there&rsquo;s no way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Etc, she begins to say some bizarre things. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s annoying trying to get in her head, plus there&rsquo;s no time, so I won&rsquo;t put this on my mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whatever Ramiris says is probably not important, probably.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;ve reached our destination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Below the core of Treyni-san&mdash;The Giant Spirit Tree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I take out the completed work from my &ldquo;Stomach&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for what it is, it&rsquo;s actually a dark orb.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no light reflecting on it nor is there any shining from it. However, this object carries certain power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its usage would be&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Treyni-san&mdash;to be more accurate, Dryads, are the offspring of fairies. They are spiritual life form that gained their bodies by merging with trees. This created their physical bodies that are made up of magicule, which allows their astral body to possess and leave at will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But no matter how they do it, their core remains within the forest, that is the Great Spirit Tree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem that the location of Walpurgis Banquet is set in a special dimension where Treyni-san may be rejected from entering. Considering that, I decided to operate a big surgery to free her core from its restraint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike Beretta, who doesn&rsquo;t possess a body in the physical world, Treyni-san has one. That&rsquo;s why in order for her to possess onto a new body, I need to transfer the core of her current body to the new one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a new core that is, I&rsquo;ve got that part covered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I am able to produce &ldquo;Holy Magic Core&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;under special conditions and with the necessary ingredients. The orb I just took out is the vessel for the &ldquo;Holy Magic Core&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To explain these, it is like extracting the magicule stone from a monster and getting rid of the magicules in it. It is very hard to turn it into one without any attribute, I failed several times before success. And I spent the day before collecting the necessary ingredients for creating this vessel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to create &ldquo;Holy Magic Core&rdquo;, I need to balance the holy aura and monster aura within the vessel. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it&rsquo;s for Beretta, you only need to take the same amount of both before reversing their properties. But it won&rsquo;t work on Treyni-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why, apart from the holy aura inserted to the vessel by Treyni-san, I need to control and release the same amount of monster aura into it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Come on, &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s time for your operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once it begins, Treyni-san, without hesitation, transfers her holy aura into the vessel. Meanwhile, I insert the monster aura.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a delicate operation that we are both following through.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Great Spirit Tree begins to gradually wither as it loses its life force. It is this moment that the orb starts to glow and distinguish in a cycle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is just like heart-beats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Light and shadow interweave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterward&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The orb begins to give off a hazy green glow. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is the ignition of the fire of life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Announcement. Mixed in individual name: Treyni&rsquo;s Attributes, &ldquo;Holy Magic Core&rdquo;creation successful.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As predicted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We did it. From now on this orb would be Treyni-san&rsquo;s core.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you, Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks, Rimuru! Now we can bring Treyni along without a problem!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, we should. But, speaking of that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now she won&rsquo;t get cut off from communicating with her core, now would she be missing when we enter a different dimension. But I still think there&rsquo;s something missing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Treyni-san, since this tree was your core, do you mind if I take it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, please use it as you wish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I express my thanks and begin to execute the idea I just came up with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehe, just sit and watch!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I begin to cut down the woods and process it into shape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are parts of a highly simulated humanoid doll.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ohoh, OHOHOHOH! Could it be that you want to&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris has seen my process of producing Beretta and seems to have realized my intent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m utilizing the Great Spirit Tree that was affected by Treyni-san&rsquo;s magic to create a temporary body for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like that, three hours passed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I finally finish making the doll since afternoon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve strengthened it with &ldquo;Magical Steel&rdquo; in the inside and polished the wood that it&rsquo;s its appearance. It is surprisingly comfortable on the hand and it&rsquo;s very much near completion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ohoh, could this be&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Treyni-san who seldom shows surprise looks rather shocked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, isn&rsquo;t it a fine job? If you don&rsquo;t mind, you can use this as your body.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s no need to ask for an answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris is overjoyed and started to hurry Treyni to try it on&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Treyni-san is also very grateful and possesses the new body while thanking me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From that moment onward, this doll would become Treyni-san&rsquo;s core body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that, a completely independent Dryad is born.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once the &ldquo;Holy Magic Core&rdquo;, which is often compared to as the heart of monster, is possessed onto the doll, the burst of magic begins to spread throughout the surface of the wood. What follows was the surprisingly damping of the white wood grain that makes it as smooth and polished as human skin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, it has surpassed the human skin to become a beauty beyond the human realm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike Beretta, whose face was made up of his skull, the wood used is carved such that its head has a simple sketch of Treyni-san&rsquo;s face. But as soon as she possesses into it, it begins to show a gentle look that is resembles closely of real humans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though it is wood carving, it is able to open its mouth and blink.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rationales are all mysteries. The only explanation is that she is a monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps it was because the wood was once her core, the two coexists very well. Anyhow, the operation turns out to be successfully due to my flash of idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For some reason, even her power was increased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before I inserted my monster aura, &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; extracted the perfect amount and formed the &ldquo;Holy Magic Core&rdquo; that is perfectly in sync with Treyni-san&rsquo;s holy aura. In other words, her magicule count is doubled as a result.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from obtaining both holy and monster attributes, she seems to have picked up new skills as well. Shion&rsquo;s magicule storage has always been the highest within my companions, yet her presence now feels stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is definitely stronger than Orc Disaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it still couldn&rsquo;t reach the same level as Demon Lord Karion. They both are, nonetheless, very strong in their own way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seems to be equal to Disaster Rank S.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s not Calamity-equivalent Special A Rank, which is what applies to a demon lord&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&#12290;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rank system made by the freedom association probably couldn&rsquo;t find the equivalent of this type of special Majin. I personally think she&rsquo;s close to Demon Lord&rsquo;s level, it is probably the correct guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dryad Humanoid Fairy&mdash;A wise monster that can rival Demon Lord. Now that Treyni-san has undergone this transition, she has become a powerful Majin that follows Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raphael must also be surprised too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. It&rsquo;s all within my prediction.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">See, isn&rsquo;t it surprised!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I know, it&rsquo;s being sour for losing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&hellip;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raphael has no comment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After achieving the small triumph mentally, I went to state farewell to Treyni-san&rsquo;s sisters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Treyni-san&rsquo;s sister Trya and Delis witnessed the whole operation. They both looked quite jealous. Speaking of them, shouldn&rsquo;t I reward the hardworking moderators that&rsquo;s been watching over Jura Great Forest, running a surgery or two with them won&rsquo;t matter much&hellip; But that would need to be on hold for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;ll discuss more when I return safely from the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they all decide to follow and server Ramiris, it would be a headache when Jura Great Forest no longer has moderators.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I return to the town having all these thoughts processed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The preparations are complete.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I raise my head unconsciously and find no trace of the moon but the beautiful stars shining across the galaxy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh yeah, tonight is the night of the new moon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under such beautiful night sky, the bell of war has rung.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this very moment&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Covered by the shining light of stars under the night sky, I walk towards my battlefield.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="id.26in1rg"></a><h2 class="c15" id="h.lnxbz9"><span class="c6 c2">Intermission</span></h2><p class="c19"><span class="c24 c2 c7">The Demon Lords</span></p><hr><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demon Lord Clayman holds his glass of wine in one hand and awaits the arrival of that moment quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tonight is the night of Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looks both happy and irritated while analyzing several intel in his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, the bad news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has ignored his friend Laplace&rsquo;s advice and ordered the attack on Beast Kingdom Yuurazania. But it turned out there wasn&rsquo;t a single citizen there, and it was a waste of his time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He went on a raging storm after receiving a report from the commanding officer Yamza. But he can&rsquo;t give out order hastily without knowing the circumstances. That&rsquo;s why Clayman temporarily assembled the army to conduct a thorough search within the area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, they discovered a group of escapees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon receiving the report, Clayman decided to order a pursuit without even thinking and dispatched reconnaissance around the area to spot out the hidden survivors. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as it turned out, several hundred residents were hiding in the area, Clayman thus ordered his generals to take care of all of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the survivors went on escape as soon as the order is delivered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman was also bewildered by this and ordered an investigation out of confusion. That was the moment he discovered that there were thousands of refugees around the area that has gathered and escaped to the Jura Forests.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hidden survivors were distractions to facilitate the escape of the main population.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Cheeky bastards!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Until that point did Clayman realize why the residents of the Beast Kingdom were nowhere to be seen. They have already mass migrated to seek refugee from Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And those escapees have noticed the movements of Clayman&rsquo;s army. Thus they&rsquo;ve released baits to help the rest to escape&mdash;This is how Clayman analyzes the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His plan to hunt down some souls before the Walpurgis Banquet has now failed. This unforeseen occurrence greatly displeases Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yamza, the Banquet is starting soon. Before I return, move out all of our force. Do not let anyone escape. Kill them all and bring me the survivors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your wish is my command!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman nods in responding to his subordinate. It has become an unarguable fact that it is too late for him to awake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman ends the magical communication; having much anger still remained in his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But on the other hand, there are also good news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman can collect intelligence through the landscape&mdash;electric signal and earth magnetism. No one knows about his talents, which is why Clayman was able to obtain immense amount of information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the origin of Clayman&rsquo;s title &ldquo;Marionette Master&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he first obtained this skill, he could only interfere with individuals within his line of sights. Nowadays, this power has grown because of Clayman&rsquo;s continuous efforts developing it and has become the trump card that backs him up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The power, namely the unique skill &ldquo;Puppeteer&rdquo;&mdash; allows him to transform intel into coded transmission so as to monitor within a large radius. He is able to dispatch and monitor his subordinates, thus gain intelligence through their points of view.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He gained the intelligence regarding the revival of &ldquo;Storm Dragon&rdquo; Veldora through it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t anything of interest to him, by chance he overheard some conversations worth investigating made by the group of humans who appeared to have been kept alive even after communicating with the storm dragon. The information Clayman got through eavesdropping the men dressed like adventurers who were leaving the monster town turns out to be a huge surprise to him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was how it went.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The self-proclaimed leader of the Jura Forest Rimuru in fact, did not eliminate the Farmus army. That was due to the revival of Storm dragon which led to the disappearance of that entire army even to this day. And it is rumored that the dragon has lost more than half of its magicule after its recent revival.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would prove why the vast Jura forest has not shown much magical reaction and why the adventurers were lucky enough to survive to retell these stories and reveal the fact to Clayman. If the &ldquo;Storm Dragon&rdquo; Veldora has been revived, Clayman, a Demon Lord, could not have missed it out. It is most likely true as the rumor goes the battle against the Farmus army has likely depleted most of his power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These two pieces of intelligence gave Clayman headache.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Why not we go wage war against the evil dragon now and defeat it at ease. On top of that, it may probably even be of use to me&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, Clayman has ambition as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem that the evil dragon has made its base at the town built by the monsters, which would make intelligence gathering harder around the area, but&hellip; He thinks it&rsquo;s nothing to be rushed as of the moment. That evil dragon won&rsquo;t be able to restore its strength in two or three days, so he can take care of it after the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">If the situation remains against our favor, I&rsquo;ll just send Milim to deal with it. Compared to that, I should&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon thinking so, Clayman decides to focus on dealing with the Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps he shouldn&rsquo;t have put that much faith in Milim&rsquo;s power&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman must have realized as well, that there are many suspicious points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The enemy has suffered no casualty by now and it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense. Besides, the survivors who are supposed to be scattered all over the region are now gathering up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This intelligence are too important for the cautious Clayman to overlook.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But right now, the man in charge of the operation at the scene is Yamza, not Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from that, Clayman&rsquo;s head has been preoccupied with the incoming Walpurgis Banquet. It holds a significant purpose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The renowned autist (shut-in) Demon Lord Ramiris suddenly demanded to add on a proposal and requested to have the person in question, Rimuru to attend the Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Clayman could not have anticipated this turn of event, letting him unable to make a judgement for the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he was concerning, everyone else just decided to accept the proposal. Now there is no room to rebut.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But at this point, the crisis may have turned into an opportunity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">No, this is perfect in fact. In the end, Rimuru would show his true color. I almost got fooled around by him about him taking on the entire Farmus army alone and triumphed. You can&rsquo;t conceal a lie like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman gives off a cunning grin as he thinks so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Rimuru wishes to join the Banquet, why not I welcome his participation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman just has to show the difference in strength between Rimuru and himself in front of the rest of the demon lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">A lowly slime tries to act all mighty with the aid of an evil dragon! You should feel honored to be defeated by my hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman thinks over about his glorious future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;However, he has overlooked something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Overlooked the slight lack of balance in the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Be careful Clayman! Don&rsquo;t act recklessly without thinking, and you&rsquo;d better not get careless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words of his friend cross his mind for a second.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman feels a sudden sense of unease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is almost as if it&rsquo;s telling him that he has missed out certain piece of the jigsaw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Clayman instead, decides to laugh it off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Don&rsquo;t worry, Laplace. I will win&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if he&rsquo;s trying to shake off the unease, Clayman downs the rest of the wine in a go.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey, with a worrying heart, prepares for the upcoming Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The situation has changed completely within a short period of time that it has completely deviated from the initial plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now with everything developing out of her expectation, she has no idea what the outcome would be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Frey is not nervous about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knows herself well that she will conduct everything calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is how &ldquo;The Harpy Queen&rdquo; Frey should behave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s definitely a good thing to have an ideal outcome, but if things continue to develop towards the wrong direction&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She has made up her mind to be personally involved if that time arrives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since she has made a deal with someone from that day onward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to defeat Charybdis, she accepted a proposal from Clayman. Its cost being for Frey to agree to a request of Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few months ago, Milim came to visit Frey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pang&mdash;&mdash;! With that sound, she opened the door rudely and entered the room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This happens too often, so Frey was somewhat accustomed to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, if any such immense and unconcealed magical aura ever approaches, it&rsquo;s anyone guesses that it would be Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim walked in to greet her immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Frey! Nice weather today!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With smiles on her face, she didn&rsquo;t care whether Frey was available to receive her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She also intentionally used her hand to brush through her beautiful cherry-gold hair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is some strange-looking object equipped on her fingers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not a ring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young girl seems to have equipped a rough-edged knuckle used to protect four of her fingers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it seems rather fitting to Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This skillfully crafted item is engraved with dragon patterns that possess strong magicule.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn&rsquo;t look strange at all being held in her tiny hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t it quite hot here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She said so while using her palm as a fan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim has never been mindful of temperature before, so her motive is quite clear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara, Milim. Long time no see, you seem to be in a good mood today. Did something good happen to you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey asked as she played along with her. If she did not ask, Milim would continue to keep up the act with her till the ends of time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm~hmm, can you tell? It&rsquo;s actually like this, check it out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim said so while showing off the dragon patterned knuckles on her hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she shows off while saying &ldquo;hehehe~&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey didn&#39;t know what to do with her and could only sigh in her heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well indeed that&rsquo;s true! I think it suits you very well. How did you come across it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She guessed that Milim would want her to ask more, so she did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim, on the other, hand starts to beat around the bush: &ldquo;Do you want to know? Now what should I do&mdash;I guess I can tell you&hellip;Hmm&mdash;what to do, what to do&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Annoying. Such an act is even irritating to Frey who&rsquo;s been used to her actions for all these years of interactions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, Milim. Aren&rsquo;t we &ldquo;Friends&rdquo;? So it should be fine to tell me, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim&rsquo;s eyes shines hearing Frey&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Indeed, indeed. We are friends! Alright, I&rsquo;ll tell you! As a matter of fact&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seemed happy hearing Frey&rsquo;s words. Milim then started to tell Frey all about the monster town happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey kept on listening to her unstopping bragging and was forced to admire different outfits of hers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey couldn&rsquo;t hide her confusion since she has never seen Milim been in such a happy state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But with that being said, Frey determined it was time to carry out her promise with Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, Milim. As a &ldquo;Friend&rdquo;, I would like to gift you something. Are you willing to take it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After which, Frey signaled her maid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The maid brought an object to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a beautiful shining pendant with a purple fabric as a base. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The pendant has a beautiful orb engraved onto it. It&rsquo;s most certainly top-ranked goods, the type that even outsiders could tell it costs a fortune.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? Isn&rsquo;t this a pendant? Can I take it? But I won&rsquo;t give you my knuckles even if I take this from you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey responded with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem, Milim. This thing shall symbolize our friendship. Since it&rsquo;s a gift from &ldquo;Friend&rsquo;, you don&rsquo;t have to be courteous with me. I&rsquo;d be happy if you are willing to wear it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey hurries her with a kind smile, and Milim nods while smiling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then just wait and see!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After which, Milim puts it on her with a smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Forbidden curse &ldquo;Demon Lord Domination&rdquo;&hellip; Conjured successfully.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, the expression on Milim&rsquo;s face faded instantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was nothing else in her eyes, the light within them that symbolizes consciousness has faded away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The pendant has released its magic and the forbidden curse has corrupted Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This pendant was the secret jewel given to Frey by Clayman&mdash;The orb of domination. As for why she let Milim put on the pendant, it was because this was the deal, she made with Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Alight, I&rsquo;ve done my part of the bargain. Then my duty is now done, what would happen to Milim&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey begins to observe Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looks like a human doll with masquerade on, just standing there without any emotion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, there were weak signs of struggle. Frey seemed to have crossed her eyes with Milim&rsquo;s blue eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For that instant, Frey senses something was amiss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could it be&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Right, that means&hellip; That&rsquo;s what it was, right, Milim&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The dragon knuckles slipped through Milim&rsquo;s joints and fell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey loosened her breath seeing this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done Clayman. Will this do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was nothing in the shades of the room. Frey talked naturally towards a specific place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There on the spot emerged a shadow, it was Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hohoho. Thanks for the trouble, Frey. Looks like now I&rsquo;ve gained the strongest puppet! Gohahahaha&mdash;! This is what happens when you look down on me as some newbie Demon Lord. How embarrassing you look now, Milim!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman lets out his laughter and begins to hit Milim hard with his hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim&rsquo;s tender cheek begins to swell and her lips are split.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without the multiple &ldquo;Barrier&rdquo; to defend herself, even Milim would be injured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This plus the opponent being Clayman, a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course she would bleed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman, with a light smile on his face, decides to continue his attack, however Frey responded coldly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d suggest you refrain yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is no comfortable scene to look at, besides&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh! Don&rsquo;t you think that this curse is some cheap shot that would be deactivated with a couple of hits. This is a forbidden curse with a massive amount of my magic inserted. Aren&rsquo;t you annoyed too that she&rsquo;s always acting all smug? That&rsquo;s why you assisted me in the first place, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. I did it to simply carry out our promise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act all high and mighty now. You are welcome. This guy is just a puppet now, a very endurable one, as long as I repair it before breaking it completely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman&rsquo;s eyes showed signs of madness as he gives Milim a kick to send her flying away. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey looks at Clayman&rsquo;s actions with cold eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">What an ugly man. So this is your nature&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, Frey has seen through this man named Clayman. From now on, she decides to trust her instinct and take actions on her own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I mean, Clayman. You may not be aware but Milim has a self-defense mechanism. I once heard it from Milim that it is called &lsquo;Frenzy Berserk&rsquo;. It would lead her to an uncontrolled state. You can go ahead and get yourself killed by it, just leave me out of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Frey&rsquo;s reminder, Clayman finally regained calmness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He smacks his lip with discontent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;*smacks lip* Ze, what&rsquo;s wrong with this demon lord&hellip; Anyway, if I play her right, I&rsquo;ll get more of a voice during my speech. Frey, you are my accomplice. So you&rsquo;d better work for me like a doll.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are? Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to be on equal term?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You idiot! I made this plan. You are already my pawn. Or perhaps, you want to take a brawl with Milim?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Are you threatening me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gohahahah! Whichever way you like to see it. If you don&rsquo;t want to die, you&rsquo;d better stay on my good side.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To impose someone with both threats and compassion</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c1">, that would be an appropriate phrase to describe Clayman&rsquo;s arrogant speech.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, the plan was made by Clayman, plus information from unknown sources. After all Milim can&rsquo;t quite resist the word &ldquo;Friend&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey is merely following her deal. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the reason why she committed to it was because she has faith in certain things&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Don&rsquo;t even think about betraying me. If you&rsquo;d like to hear my request, I&rsquo;ll allow you to continue as &lsquo;Ruler of the sky&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is at the point of no return.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, Frey has fallen as Clayman&rsquo;s accomplice&mdash;or his puppet in reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;These are the events that took place several weeks before the day of destruction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having withdrawn from the memory of that time, Frey sighs quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman has full control over Milim. With such violent power to back himself up, he&rsquo;s able to put high pressure on Frey as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, Frey follows Clayman&rsquo;s order and is forced to be his accomplice. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This must have been her own doing&mdash;She mocks herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was stupid enough to have trusted Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, on the other hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is a cunning Demon Lord that can&rsquo;t be underestimated. He has too much confidence in his own strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;This is why it has colluded Clayman from seeing the nature of things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But luckily, Frey possesses the insights to see the nature of things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is no skill, but simply the result of her interactions with other people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman only sees others as tools, thus he may never see the truth of things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey decides to trust her own instinct and make a gamble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter what the result is&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Clayman, you won&rsquo;t live for any longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey confirms the sequence of actions planned by her in heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she recalls the &ldquo;Promise&rdquo;, and a smile crawls up her cheek without her noticing.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the frozen land where the freezing breezes of icy wind blows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The surrounding of this land consists of ice plains with permanently frozen soil. The temperature is below a hundred and twenty Celsius, which very few living beings could survive under. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A castle stands tall in the central area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A castle of beauty and fantasy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A demon fortress projected to the physical realm through the use of unimaginable amount of magicule. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its name is &ldquo;Palace of White Ice&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is the residence of Demon Lord Guy Crimson.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone is stroking casually on the hallway of the castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person has long blonde hair, below which his long and narrow blue eyes as well as his handsome appearance display a heavenly sight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those plus his smooth, white tender skin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a handsome man with incredibly beautiful appearance that would make other question his gender.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is Demon Lord Leon Cromwell, the so called &ldquo;Platinum Demon&rdquo; or &ldquo;Platinum Saber&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s treating the castle as if it&rsquo;s his home and stroking around the hallway without a care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A giant door lies in front of him, along it are beautiful sculptures. This door leads to the main hall where the ruler of the castle awaits. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon came to look for the ruler Guy Crimson. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He stood before the door and waited for the two strong demons to come forth and open the door. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterward&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Demon Lord Leon Cromwell-sama has arrived!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A beautiful demon with female form stood in the inner side of the door and announces </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The powerful greater demons split into two rows and await by the two sides of the door. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are all named demons with flesh. Their strength has already surpassed greater demon, and could even easily outrank greater Majins. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are all equipped with magical equipment and all seem to have evolved. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In total, there are around two hundred of them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are even ones that may rival Special A Calamity. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, even though these demons are considered top-notch in strength&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Deep into the meeting hall, the demon lord Guy Crimson sits in his throne at the center. Right now there are six great demon lords awaiting his order. The rest of the demons seem far inferior when compared to the prestige displayed by the six. </span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 641.14px; height: 914.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image9.png" style="width: 641.14px; height: 914.50px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All six demons are named Greater Demon General. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They all possess combat abilities to crash many among the rank of Calamity. It is likely that they may even have power to rival Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;But, even these six Great Demon Generals are not allowed to speak without permission here. This is due to the uncrossable gap in authority&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just now it was a green-hair demon that informed the hall of Leon&rsquo;s visit and a blue-hair demon that tended to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their beautiful appearances are like human desire manifested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both of whose fit bodies are covered by dark red maid suits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The green-hair demon is named Misery, the Blue-hair demon&rsquo;s is Rain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They speak for their king.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These two great demons are the left and right hands of the absolute ruler Guy Crimson. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their rank &ldquo;Demon Noble&rdquo;, make them the strongest among the Calamity class.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their power is sufficient to rival Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon walks down the central path and stops below the throne.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misery and Rain bow to him and proceed to stand beside Guy on each side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, the king stands up from his throne.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only two persons who are permitted to move in the room are now only the two demon lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Long time no see, my friend Leon. How have you been? I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve responded to my invitation. I should thank you for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is a wonderfully alluring voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His crimson red eyes have sparkled gold stars within; His slightly curly hair looks scarlet red like burning flame, its redness is thicker than the color of blood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s about the same height as Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As opposed to Leon&rsquo;s feminine beauty, Guy&rsquo;s beauty comes from a place of pride and lonesomeness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such eerily bizarre beauty exudes the aura of an overlord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He speaks to Leon and starts to move down from his high throne to Leon&rsquo;s face. His hands gradually wrapped around Leon&rsquo;s chest and hugs him close tightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His hands continue to move and fondle along Leon&rsquo;s face, and without hesitation, kisses him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon&rsquo;s face frowns with disgust and pushes Guy away. He starts to complain as usual:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stop it. I&rsquo;m not interested in men. Haven&rsquo;t I told you this several times already?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His face looks confused as it stares at Guy angrily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahahaha. You are such a cold man as always. But if that&rsquo;s what you want, I&rsquo;m fine with being a woman. But let&rsquo;s put that aside and change a place to talk&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy sounds rather pleased this time and starts to move before hearing Leon&rsquo;s response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This scene plays out every time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this frozen land, Guy wears a truly unique outfit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The outfit he wears have many openings, exposing his skin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even so, as a demon, Guy doesn&rsquo;t mind coldness. To him it does not even tickle him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A sudden bewitching smile emerges on Guy&rsquo;s beautiful face as he recalls the taste of Leon&rsquo;s lip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He licks his bloody lips with his snake-like tongue&hellip; It&#39;s a rather intriguing scenery that bears a devilish charm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy could switch his gender at will, and both men and women can invoke his lust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is him&mdash;her&mdash;This is the Demon Lord Guy Crimson. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The owner of this castle, the strongest, most ancient Demon Lord&mdash;The overlord of this forever frozen continent, who rules in the name of &ldquo;Lord of Darkness&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy didn&rsquo;t tend to Leon and walk in front by himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon naturally follows behind him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before the two could exit the hall, no one present dares to make a single noise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since that is not permitted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone bows their heads low and await quietly before their master and the guest to leave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After confirming Leon has left, Misery and Rain raise up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They thus say:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dismiss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rain herself also gives order to several subordinates. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misery and Rain thus leave to prepare tea for the guest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They have the highest position among the demons in the castle, and their role, however, happen to be taking care of their master, Demon Lord Guy Crimson&rsquo;s daily chores. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s not any work more important than theirs in this castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Before their master loses his temper, they&rsquo;d better hurry up with their work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon followed Guy to the top of the frost balcony. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although the location is open to outside, not a single flake of snow is allowed to enter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has been made into a comfortable space after accommodation. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy isn&rsquo;t affected by the environment at all. However, the air-conditioning mechanism is specially made for Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy is arrogant and prideful, but he&rsquo;s very caring towards those who he recognizes and his friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy&rsquo;s still the same way. Leon thinks to himself while he sits down with Guy&rsquo;s invitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The chair is made of ice, yet the there is no sense of chilliness felt from it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon though isn&rsquo;t surprised at all. He instead inquires:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, why did you call me here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He falls back to his chair as the ice chair catches him gently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same as usual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Somehow an ice table appears out of nowhere, and Rain begins to serve tea to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misery quietly awaits outside of the balcony entrance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They won&rsquo;t at all interfere with the conversation between their master and his guest. Not a single word is permitted to be spoken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no equal relationship here. Before they receive their order, they can&rsquo;t even express any emotion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they are to do anything without Guy&rsquo;s order, they would be gifted with death on the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It matters little that they are &ldquo;Demon Noble&rdquo; with immense power. They are nothing but tools in front of demon lord such as Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s how strong Guy is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is why even if Leon launches an attack on Guy, they will not intervene on their own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy is the absolute ruler and it would be a great disrespect to even worry about Guy&rsquo;s safety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why they are being treated like air. And the conversation continued. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. As you can see, the Walpurgis Banquet is about to start. But I mean to take you there even by force this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ho? Forcing me to participate? That&rsquo;s unusual.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Consider doing me a favor, but I&rsquo;m getting you to attend regardless!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Why is that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ha, you&rsquo;re still the same way, always so careful. Very well, perhaps I&rsquo;ll fill you in then&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy shows a joyful smile and said so, thus begins his explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;The one proposing the meeting this time is Clayman, no one special. But the strange thing is Milim was listed as seconder. Milim is one of the most ancient demon lord like me, how could she be playing along some scum like Clayman? It can only mean&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something strange about Karion&rsquo;s death. Is that where you are trying to get?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehh, so you do know about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy&rsquo;s mood got a lot worse having been guessed what he&rsquo;s trying to say. But Leon didn&rsquo;t seem to care and continues with his words:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Clayman really went above the line this time. He&rsquo;s always been causing trouble for me without leaving any trace, but this time I can&rsquo;t just sit and take it. Apart from the whereabout of Karion, it&rsquo;ll be trouble if Milim moves out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He says so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing so, Guy nods happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s exactly my thought. It may be a game to Milim just like before, but if the balance among Demon Lords are to be broken, it won&rsquo;t be child&rsquo;s play anymore. I&rsquo;ll certainly have to do more work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy regained his good mood, followed by Leon who asks the most pressing question: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, Guy. Do you think Milim have been manipulated by Clayman?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question is asked, but Guy&rsquo;s response shows his lack of care towards the issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t matter much to worry over Milim&rsquo;s business. Smart people like me will never understand what an idiot is thinking. That is one of my few weaknesses.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He shrugs as he finishes and throws a smile him a smile. Then he turns the topic back on the original question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look how concerned you look now. Leon, does this mean you are interested in taking part in the Banquet, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no use trying to probe the thoughts of one another, so Leon decides to reply honestly:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I was planning to. Although I hate to spend time around others, I guess I&rsquo;ll have to participate this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? That&rsquo;s great. And I was planning to spend the night with you (on bottom) then&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you I don&rsquo;t do it with man. And even if it&rsquo;s a woman, I won&rsquo;t do it with ones I don&rsquo;t like. Plus I don&rsquo;t get stand to gain anything sleeping with you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehhh, don&rsquo;t be so hasty now. If you really mean it, I can turn myself into a woman&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as Leon finishes, Guy begins to harass Leon all seductive looking. But Leon has expected that and gave him a perfect counter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two often play this game of offense and defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, Leon. Ramiris seldom expresses her opinion, so how much do you know about the person called &ldquo;Rimuru&rdquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Leon won&rsquo;t bite, Guy changes to another topic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is also related to the topic at hand. There has been new demon lord after Leon, and the rest of the demon lords seem to be interested in this topic as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From Clayman&rsquo;s testimony, he seemed to have crowned himself the title Demon Lord without our approval. I personally think that this Rimuru guy can be a Demon Lord if he is powerful enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, so you think he&rsquo;s qualified. Ramiris also came to stir the pot. I&rsquo;m rather intrigued by this whole ordeal since it was sufficient to get her interest. I definitely can have some fun with this Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman was the one initiating the Banquet, and with Ramiris&rsquo; request, the person involved Rimuru would also join.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So they can safely deduce that Ramiris has a say to Clayman&rsquo;s action this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Ramiris, well. I&rsquo;m no good against that elf. Every time we meet, she makes fun of me. I kinda want to strangle her to death for a few times&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even so, since Ramiris has already spoken, Leon could only nod in agreement. He still feels some moral responsibility towards her, so he has to comply. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahahaha. Come on now. If you kill Ramiris, I&rsquo;ll become your enemy then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought as much. But it&rsquo;s me saying. Plus I stand no chance against you anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon only dislikes Ramiris for making fun of him, he doesn&rsquo;t really mean any harm to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, Leon stands no chance winning against Guy. That part is true too. Despite both of them are all demon lords, their difference in power is heaven and earth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy&rsquo;s power is almost from a different dimension compared to people like Leon and Misery.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? How could that be? If it is you, you still have a one in a million chance to kill me, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way. I only fight battles that I can win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on, don&rsquo;t be so modest. Basically, there&rsquo;re very few people who can hurt me. I may actually die in your hand, since you are a powerful guy, Leon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh, you don&rsquo;t say. It&rsquo;s because you are Milim are way too strong. Speaking of being unreasonably strong&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon recalls something while saying so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;He heard that &ldquo;Storm Dragon&rdquo; Veldora has awakened. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would be a first that Leon has surprised Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, a voice cold as ice interrupts the two&rsquo;s conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara ara, now that is intriguing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The owner of the voice is a beautiful female. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One with snow white skin like porcelain. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes that emits cold light is seductive and they are blue like the deep sea. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her pearl-white hair droops down along her cheek and her light red lips look extremely eye-catching.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The woman walked forward and spoke without Guy&rsquo;s permission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She possesses a beautiful aura around her more shining than jewels. People call her &ldquo;Ice Empress&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or perhaps&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She has a better-known name, &ldquo;White Ice Dragon&rdquo; Velzado.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is the one of the four remaining &ldquo;True Dragon&rdquo;, a friend&mdash;and partner to the Demon Lord Guy Crimson.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, she gets to sit on equal ground to Guy like Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, It&rsquo;s Velzado. That being said, I almost forgot that there is a &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo; here too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon plays dumb and says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ayy? Aren&rsquo;t you cold as always? But, I&rsquo;m pretty happy you decided to show up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? I also get to have a eyes&rsquo; full of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon and Velzado exchanges some polite greets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both&rsquo; are pretenses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh. You two are always like this, just can&rsquo;t get along with each other.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy&rsquo;s rather irritated while saying so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said though, Guy doesn&rsquo;t plan to help mitigate their relation at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it&rsquo;s usual, they would continue to exchange those fake-sounding courtesy, but&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;right, so as you were saying&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, Velzado took the initiative in changing the topic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leon-sama, did you just say that my &ldquo;younger brother&rdquo; has awaken?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her blue eyes shine as she asks, meaning to see if Leon&rsquo;s shocking news is true or not. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that true, Leon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;His presence disappears around two years ago, and I thought he was gone for good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Veldora is revived, the overwhelming magicule outburst will most certainly cause drastic change to climate of the land for them to notice. However, there was no sign of such a thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why both Guy and Velzado are surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way around it. The source came from the spies I sent to the western states.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;? If that&rsquo;s true, why have that evil dragon been so quiet? Has he weakened so much that he can&rsquo;t even resupply his own magicule on his own?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;On top of that, who could have broken the seal on that child? I thought he doesn&rsquo;t possess the power to break it by himself&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldora was sealed by a Chosen Hero</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Veldora&rsquo;s view, it was the appropriate punishment for her reckless brother. So she has intentionally left the seal as it was. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he reflects himself well and finally decides to be a doll. Velzado would have given him a helping hand before he gets completely eliminated. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Veldora first disappeared from the world, she was rather confused. Since the time of his destruction seems too early compared to the time Velzado has predicted. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From the report of the spy, Clayman&rsquo;s conspiracy seems to have been the main cause. He forced the western state to take actions, the great kingdom of Farmus to be particular. He found people to instigate them to invade and eliminate the Jura Forest Alliance built by Rimuru. As it turns out, the Farmus army was completely decimated. And now Rimuru comes out and calls himself a demon lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know your stuff well, Leon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. Unlike you, I used to be human. Apart from that, I confirmed that Veldora was indeed resting near the frontline of the battle. It is rumored that the truth of the matter is that Veldora, almost near his demise was able to awake after absorbing the large amount of blood tainted on the battlefield.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru was able to escape from danger after Farmus army was involved in this whole ordeal and was eliminated completely. Leon adds on top of his explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that was the case. Then was the breaking of seal just a coincidence?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. I wasn&rsquo;t informed on that matter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s true too, Velzado nods in response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon&rsquo;s correct, there&rsquo;s no way to judge that simply from espionage. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Chosen Hero&rsquo;s unique skill &ldquo;Infinite Prison&rdquo; was able to lock the targeted object into an imaginary space. It isn&rsquo;t weak enough to have it revoked from the affected individual trapped inside. But even if that&rsquo;s the case, the presence of Veldora has yet to influence the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Perhaps there&rsquo;s some flaws with Chosen Hero&rsquo;s seal&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would make more sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velzado thinks so, yet Leon expresses something unexpected to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible. But allow me to propose a theory. What if someone created a subspace that absorbed both Veldora and the seal?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The theory interests with Guy as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Interesting! If that&rsquo;s the case, this unknown individual could then unlock the Chosen Hero&rsquo;s seal. That seal seems to have a special tie with the Chosen Hero and cannot be undone using normal skills. It may be solvable if we are the one dealing with it, in other words, this mysterious person has power to rival us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy says so with great pleasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But regardless, it&rsquo;s just a possibility.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you think that mysterious individual is &ldquo;Rimuru&rdquo;, right, Leon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. If that&rsquo;s the case, I do need to meet him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Guy thought Leon&rsquo;s difference in attitude in attending the meeting is a rare sight of a lifetime. But if this is the case, that would certainly make more sense. Guy finally realizes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is being reckless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim has been acting weird.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Rimuru proclaims himself Demon Lord alongside with Veldora losing his seal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we assume all of these events are all connected&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This Walpurgis Banquet has indeed become very interesting. An intoxicating smile emerges on Guy&rsquo;s face as he thinks so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But suddenly something came up on his mind that concerns him, Guy starts to mumble:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But speaking of that, why has Veldora become so quiet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velzado makes the following response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;He seems to have become weak. The reaction is extremely weak, hardly as powerful as before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velzado is also a &ldquo;True Dragon&rdquo;, so Veldora&rsquo;s presence hasn&rsquo;t been so weak that she can&rsquo;t find with some efforts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would make the most sense if it due to him becoming weaker&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, it&rsquo;s rather disappointing that he hasn&rsquo;t gone on a rampage by now. If it&rsquo;s that child&rsquo;s personality, chaos is his way of life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velzado also doesn&rsquo;t get why that was the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyhow, it doesn&#39;t matter. I&rsquo;m not really interested in Veldora. If you guys want to get him on board, then be my guest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon says so without a care and decides to stand up from his seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike Velzado who are the same race as Veldora, or Guy who is worrying about what to about him, this is all none of Leon&rsquo;s business. As long as Veldora stays away from Leon&rsquo;s territory, he won&rsquo;t actively care about what Veldora does.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is how difficult it is to deal with the evil dragon Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you leaving already?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, didn&rsquo;t you call me for these?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehh, just wait a little longer, don&rsquo;t be in such a rush? Right, have you got any closer to your &ldquo;specific summoning&rdquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to prevent Leon from leaving, Guy asks him about the result of his experiments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is after all; experiments Leon spent all his life investing. So Guy is also quite interested in the result.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;well, about that, I haven&rsquo;t made much progress. I&rsquo;ve changed my method to random summoning, but it always ended up in failure. It&rsquo;s also attracting too much attention. I had intentionally theorized &ldquo;incomplete summoning&rdquo; and leaked the news to the western states. But then the Freedom Association began to intervene. The current method is hardly efficient considering the probabilities, and since there may be more people come and try to intervene. I am considering trying an alternative in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Honestly, Leon has little interest for the Walpurgis Banquet or the new Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He simply wants to eliminate any possible threat that may intervene his research early. That is all he cared. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You said intervention?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. They saved a bunch of kids who were going to die anyway&mdash;before I could receive the them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. So they were taken away by force before you got the results. Then, these rescuers would likely intervene in the future too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably the case. That guy seems to be also annoyed by the summoning of children around the countries, so he may even pressure these countries. Given the circumstance, I won&rsquo;t continue my experiment. If I am to continue, I may get exposed of being behind the scene one day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, why don&rsquo;t you just eliminate the nuisance?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It should be a chore if it&rsquo;s you right? Guy sends the signal through his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Leon instead sighs to Guy&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The nuisance individual happens to be the &ldquo;Rimuru&rdquo; I just mentioned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nani? Could this really be just coincidence?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that interesting? That&rsquo;s why I wish to see him as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon nods looking all serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, had Ramiris not come and stir the pot, he may have overlooked the issue&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so, now I&rsquo;m even more interested in him. Perhaps Milim thought the same way like me. That girl may be silly, but her instinct is quite keen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Perhaps. Anyway, there&rsquo;s gonna be hell of a show during tonight&rsquo;s Banquet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehe, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon saying so, the two smiles at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velzado observes the two on the side with a gentle look in her blue eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that they continued to chat with joy for a while before Guy changed the subject:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speaking of which, I&rsquo;ve been curious about something. Who is the supplier of your intelligences all this time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He apparently came from the Eastern Empire. I&rsquo;ve got no clue about the detail. He&rsquo;s a self-proclaimed merchant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to summon &ldquo;Otherworlder&rdquo;, it requires a large amount of magicule, specific conditions and rituals. There are many complicated factors involved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The more sufficient one prepares with these factors in mind, the longer interval it will be for one to prepare a second summoning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why Leon has made a deal with that merchant to have him conduct the summoning in his place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, is this merchant trust-worthy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Trust? I have no use for that, I&rsquo;m simply manipulating him for now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? Do what you like, I&rsquo;ve got no objection. But don&rsquo;t get careless with it! I won&rsquo;t allow you to die without my permission.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, are you worrying about me? How rare, Guy. Don&rsquo;t worry. I won&rsquo;t just die without achieving my goal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here we go again&hellip; Is that thing really this important?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah it is. To me, it&rsquo;s the most important thing in the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? That makes me jealous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Spare the sweet talk. I&rsquo;ll keep your advice in mind. Then, I&rsquo;ll see you tonight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, Leon leaves the castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time Guy did not try to stop him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are crystals of light</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;left at the scene as Leon exits with &ldquo;Dimensional Transportation&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two pairs of eyes observe as he departed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always in such a rush. Well, that&rsquo;s Leon for you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy gives off a wry smile while saying so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But Leon has always been cautious. Yet this time his plans are flawed with exploits. He doesn&#39;t seem to know the identity of his assistor. Should we help him to find it out?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velzado asks in a cold tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No need for that. If we trespass his business too much, Leon would be upset. I don&rsquo;t wish to be disliked by my friend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy answers, without a shred of worry. To Guy, his friend Leon is a trustworthy man. He said so knowing Leon&rsquo;s personality. He knows it better than anymore that Leon is a hardworking guy. If Leon never sought to uncover the identity of his assistors, it simply means that it&rsquo;s not necessary for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help him out when he does come to seek help from me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After which, the two ended the discussion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the list of attendees of tonight&rsquo;s Walpurgis Banquet has been settled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The proposers are Clayman, Frey and Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course Ramiris who requested an amendment of participant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The shut-in Leon has also decided to join.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s another person who hates to show up in public. That Demon Lord&rsquo;s whereabout has been unknown. But Guy has forced the person out using Demon Lords&rsquo; special communication channel. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Additionally, there are Guy&rsquo;s old friend Dagruel and a certain other&hellip; He won&rsquo;t need to worry about him since Dagruel has agreed to bring him along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lastly, it&rsquo;s Guy himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from Karion, who has been missing for some time. The Ten Great Demon Lords are finally reuniting after some time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This seems to be fun. Do you want to come along?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that&hellip; No, I&rsquo;ll pass. But it will be a different case if I see my brother there, otherwise I&rsquo;m not interested in demon lords.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? It matters not. Then you can look after the house for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sure, leave it to me. You should go get ready too now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velzado leaves her seat after saying so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now only Guy remains. He looks far away to what seems to be the polar light spread on this frozen land and has his mind fixed on the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demon lords who only plays tricks and sabotages behind everyone&rsquo;s back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Someone supposedly is a new Demon Lord yet got destroyed so easily.</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His shut-in friend also got a move-on, which makes him reminiscent of the past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the birth of a new demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Interesting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His mood hasn&rsquo;t been so hyped up for several hundred years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s time for some major reforms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, the Demon Lords are never companions, but competing opponents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, the number of Demon Lords are not limited to ten persons. In fact, there was once a time that there were more than dozens of Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It matters very little whether is it ten or a hundred.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you can&rsquo;t do your part, you will get eliminated through the &ldquo;Great War Between Angels and Demons&rdquo;(Tenma Daisen) commenced every five hundred years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are always new power rising through the great war. But gradually the cap of members was fixed to ten persons. To the people who are aware of this, they thus call them the Ten Great Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that&rsquo;s not approved by Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To humans, it would be in their best interests to have the dangerous demon lords continued to fight against each other&rsquo;s rule and reduce in number through the process. But somehow, the Ten Great Demon Lords become an unspoken rule.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this rule is about to be struck off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The weak does not deserve the title &ldquo;Demon Lord&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s about time for the real deal to dominate the world again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;That is Guy&rsquo;s opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy was the first Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As one of the Seven Primordial Demons, he was summoned to earth as a Greater Demon General.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;The unnamed Primordial Red (Rouge) was unleashed to the world that day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He granted the wishes of the humans without power to decimate what was suspected to their hostile nations in war against. He later also destroyed the human kingdom that summoned him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As his reward, he gained this name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The desperate sighs of humans that he heard sounded similar to the word &ldquo;Guy&rdquo;. It became his name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After obtaining a name, Guy discovered that he has awakened to be a true demon lord. Although to Guy, who had already believed deeply that he is the strongest being, the power was unnecessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Due to Guy&rsquo;s evolution, it also affected the Primordial Green (Vert) and Primordial Blue (Bleu) who were summoned to do his chores.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two, who were called the shadow of Primordial Red, gained body like Guy and became &ldquo;Demon Noble&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy, intrigued at the time, allowed them to follow him and granted them names.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Primordial Green was named according the painful expression displayed on the humans, &ldquo;Misery&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Primordial Blue was named according to the red rain due to the bloodshed, &ldquo;Rain&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From that day onward, he granted both permission to stay around him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sometime after Guy awaked to become a demon lord, it didn&rsquo;t take long before someone else awaked to become a true demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That someone was Milim,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ancestors of the four &ldquo;True Dragons&rdquo; emerged to the physical world and bred with humans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What incredible thing was that the &ldquo;True Dragon&rdquo; who reproduced with humans were deprived of most of its power by their offspring. From then on, the breeding of True Dragon and Human became a taboo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The true dragon who lost its power exploded into pieces. But it was successful in obtaining flesh on the ground world. It became the ancestors of dragon race.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The future generation would instead call the &ldquo;Holy Will of Nature&rdquo; as the &ldquo;True Dragon&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nowadays, the dragon race is able to prosper on this land and its origin can all be traced to this one ancestor dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the &ldquo;True Dragon&rdquo;&mdash;&rdquo;Star King Dragon&rdquo; Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;Star King Dragon&rdquo; Veldanava gifted his his reincarnated self&mdash;a small dragon to her daughter as a pet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That small dragon was killed in a certain kingdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those fools enraged the tyrant Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fury tore through the sky and earth as she destroyed the country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And later Milim was awakened to be a true demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;As Milim, who has lost her reasoning, continued on to rain destruction on the world </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The one that came forth and stopped her was Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They fought seven days and nights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They fought until the world turned dark, rendering the prosper land of the west a land of death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in the end, neither were able to come to a conclusion of victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Due to Milim regaining her senses, the battle got to be ended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The one that restored her reasoning was Ramiris. She came down to the earth as the Queen of Elves and utilized all of power to neutralize the hatred within Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the price was nonetheless high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris&rsquo; power gradually dissipate due to the tainting of both the evil spirit of both Dragon and Demon. In the end she fell from grace and ended up where she is today. A fairy who is in perpetual reincarnations. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although the price was so high, she was successful in stopping Milim from continuing her rampage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To prevent world destruction, both Guy and Milim accepted a truce.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These three were the original Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three persons pursued three different goals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One pursued absolute power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One wanted to live life freely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One hoped for world peace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But those would suffice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three got to know each other precisely for their difference in end goals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, the Titan guarding the gateway to the sky and the ancient Vampire also become Demon Lord. The Fallen angel then took the sixth seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are the second generation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are far from the ancient Demon Lords, but nonetheless, the pinnacle of the strong who may rule the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Titan, due to the holy element he inherently possesses, has yet to show any unique character of a demon lord. But he is also a rather intriguing individual who possesses extraordinary power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ancient vampire is cunning and loves to come up with deviant ideas/</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the current generation of it doesn&rsquo;t seem as powerful as before, but perhaps&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sixth seat is a special case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has undeniable strength, but he seems to have very little interest in the current life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why he enjoys sloth. He has everything to become a king, yet he still leads a lifestyle of sloth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are in total six persons including Guy, apart from the Titan and the fairy, the remaining four all have awakened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are all survivors of several Tenma Great War; their abilities have undergone countless trials and prevailed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like Guy and Milim, it shouldn&rsquo;t be any surprise if they have obtained some ultimate skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from that, there&rsquo;s also Guy&rsquo;s friend Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon was originally a human and a &ldquo;Chosen Hero&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Due to encountering some special circumstances, he obtained his ultimate skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s a strong man even recognized by Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, there are seven persons in total.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">I wonder, how many people would be able to be an equal to all seven of them during this Walpurgis Banquet.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Guy smiles joyfully having stumbled on the thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This fool tried to control Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What an absolute joke, it&rsquo;s hard enough for one to even try to hide from laughing at it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His goal is nothing but a lunatic&rsquo;s raving.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mere Clayman couldn&rsquo;t possibly be able to achieve something even Guy can&rsquo;t do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who possess ultimate skills cannot be affected by low level skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this world&rsquo;s rule, only those who&rsquo;ve obtained &ldquo;Unique Skills&rdquo; could resist against the strong control of magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They should still be subjected to elemental attacks that could target their weakness. But speaking of that, there&rsquo;s no way mind control would ever work. Whoever&rsquo;s mind is so fragile that can be manipulated with such skill could never obtain ultimate skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultimate skills, as they&rsquo;re called, are devices to grant access to the ultimate principles of this world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why, in order to combat against an ultimate skill, one must employ ultimate skill as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is simply how this world works.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman can&rsquo;t even touch Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would mean, everything has been under Milim&rsquo;s control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">What an absolute fool&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy shows a small smile and decide to observe how things go in silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The time when the weak can pose as demon lords is finally over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The imposters shall be eliminated while the real Demon Lords assume rule.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy gives off a big pretty smile as he believes the arrival of the day is imminent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Afterward, the Walpurgis Banquet filled with climaxes unveils itself.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="id.35nkun2"></a><h2 class="c15" id="h.1ksv4uv"><span class="c6 c2">Chapter 4</span></h2><p class="c19"><span class="c2 c7">Place of destiny</span></p><hr><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since we&rsquo;ve prepared ourselves, I give orders to Veldora while waiting for people to take us to the venue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am following Ramiris since I don&rsquo;t know the location of the Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of that, Ramiris seems to be unaware of its location as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I asked her why she doesn&rsquo;t know, she simply answered &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m escorted to the place every time!&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s quite a telling answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since she always gets lost, so it became an unwritten rule to have someone to lead her every time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no use forcing someone who&rsquo;s not willing to memorize directions to memorize one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They will likely send someone with a dimensional transportation ability here, so I&rsquo;ve decided to wait for their arrival as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It soon reached eleven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, but no one came to pick us up. Instead, I got contacted by Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Is there a problem?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I responded immediately and Benimaru begins to make a request in a calm tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is what he said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our army has engaged the enemies and they&rsquo;ve now been informed of the enemy forces&rsquo; composition&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Due to my blessing, Benimaru has evolved to Youki</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class="c1">, a spiritual life form similar to a Dryad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, Benimaru&rsquo;s power level could already rival the likes of Treyni-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna, Souei and Hakurou also became Youki and can be considered to be very high-level species as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is great, but the problem lies with the new skill Benimaru gained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unique skill &ldquo;Generalissimo&rdquo;&mdash; A very suitable skill for Benimaru&rsquo;s aggressive style. It is a skill specialized in controlling one&rsquo;s power output.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His power will not go out of control no matter how much strength he puts into it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The secret lies within &ldquo;Prediction Analysis&rdquo;, an ability which can completely analyze the flow of one&rsquo;s strength and remove inefficiencies from it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only is it a great skill for personal combat, it is also useful in leading army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By treating the army&rsquo;s movements as a flow of power, it can act as something similar to a predicting skill to determine the outcome of a situation. As soon as our army is in disadvantage, he can motion the army to alter the attack plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s is literally cheating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The accuracy of communicated information is of the utmost importance on the battlefield, and yet Benimaru can effortlessly communicate with and command the entire army in the most optimum way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Right now there are, along with the soldiers of the Beast Kingdom, a total of thirty thousand men in the united army under Benimaru&rsquo;s command. Benimaru can command the soldiers with the same precision as if they are his hands or arms, and lead the army of thirty-thousand units. It&rsquo;s normal that they seem to be behaving abnormally (with his command)</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Additionally, Unique Skill &ldquo;Generalissimo&rdquo; also possesses the ability &ldquo;Morale Boost&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the massive enhancement in the precision of army commanding, each soldier&rsquo;s individual ability seems to have also been raised by around thirty percent. The overall strength of the army, consequently, is also increased by about thirty percent. The army is on par with the enemies in terms of number, and with the addition of superior soldiers, there is no reason why we would lose. With the adjustment of other skills, our chance of victory is even higher than before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;All because Benimaru is in possession of such a powerful ability now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem that our army has secured the victory as soon as the battle starts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why he came up with a new attack plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;It&rsquo;s just like this, we want to directly invade the enemy base. Souei is also tempted to try it out. Since we&rsquo;re all here, we should take down the suspected Clayman&rsquo;s castle in the fog bank as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru sure lives up to his reputation, what great confidence it is coming from him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t that be too dangerous? The fight has just begun, and victory is still not guaranteed&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem. I&rsquo;ve got it covered. Besides, the one in charge of attacking their base would be Souei and Hakurou&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please wait a moment, Onii-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone hacked into my &ldquo;Telepathy Net&rdquo; I was using to communicate with Benimaru&mdash;It&rsquo;s Shuna who was serving me some tea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, I didn&rsquo;t open this line to the public. And yet she broke in with such ease&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, ohoh! What&rsquo;s wrong, Shuna?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like me, we both got a bit spooked. Benimaru&rsquo;s voice seemed to jump a couple of pitches up for a split second.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How dare you say what&rsquo;s wrong with me, Onii-san! Doesn&rsquo;t that Demon Lord Clayman possess dangerous power to manipulate people? What if Souei and Hakurou fall under his control&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, they will be fine&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way! If you really insist on sending them, I want to participate in the battle as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oi oi oi! I thought that Shuna is the well-behaved, quiet type, so why is she making these kinds of demands now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But my surprise was ignored as Benimaru continued to argue with Shuna.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brothers can never win in an argument against their sisters&mdash;That is what a friend from my last life once told me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru is not as confident sounding as before, he can&rsquo;t win the argument and got pinned down by Shuna with her arguments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it is, Rimuru-sama, please grant me permission to participate in the battle!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna proposes with smile all over her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm&mdash;even if you say so&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t want to send Shuna to such a dangerous place either, but she does have a point. It would indeed be problematic if Souei and the rest got manipulated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, then should we not be trying to attack like this in the first place? However, it will certainly be the best opportunity to take the castle and prevent the enemy army from retreating back to their base. Indeed, the time that Clayman is absent for Walpurgis Banquet is our fated one and only chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it should be okay as long as I prevent Clayman from escaping. I don&rsquo;t intend to kill all the Majins under Clayman&rsquo;s rule.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Rimuru-sama, please do not worry. I&rsquo;ll protect Shuna-sama&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will also be there, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue exploring the enemy&rsquo;s base. But we do need to investigate whether Karion-sama is locked up in there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei and Hakurou also joined our &ldquo;Telepathy Net&rdquo; to try and convince me. It seems Shuna have called them to play along with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna is surprisingly stubborn and I really want to agree with her. Moreover, it is truly a concern whether Karion has been brought to Clayman&rsquo;s castle or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, I am angry as well. I can&rsquo;t subdue my emotion to ever forgive what Clayman has done!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah&hellip; I totally get how you feel. Not only me, everyone has a grudge against him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I indeed understand how Shuna feels as she no longer wants to stay and wait in the town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then we should have Shuna join the battle. But, Souei and Hakurou, you two must put Shuna&rsquo;s safety as the number one priority. Additionally, if the enemies&rsquo; combat abilities overpower yours beyond expectation, you must prioritize your personal safety first and bring back such information. If you find Demon Lord Karion, do not engage unless it is safe. Do you all understand?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shuna is just so stubborn. But it would truly be a great help with your permission.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have the teleportation skill, so it won&rsquo;t be a problem even in cases of emergency.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. I am in fact much slower in terms of speed if we are to attempt an escape.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though Hakurou doesn&rsquo;t plan to escape, he still said that to help to smooth things out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We all have psyche attack resistance, so it should be sufficient to prevent us from falling into others&rsquo; control. Especially with Shuna-sama accompanying us, we would be further reassured in terms of that concern. As for Karion-sama, we will decide our plan if and when we actually find him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei also interjects and adds, hoping to reassure me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, with Shuna&rsquo;s unique skill &ldquo;Analyst&rdquo;, they can analyze any attack against the psyche. Shuna can also use &ldquo;Dimensional Movement&rdquo;, so I may have been worrying too much. Despite Shuna&rsquo;s low magicule pool, her skills are all outstanding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just as Souei said regarding Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s possible that he may not be detained there anyway, so it&rsquo;s no use worrying over it now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve approved then, but you all must make sure to be vigilant of the situation and have your eyes wide open. For an extra layer of safety precautions, the time to commence this operation should be set after the start of the Walpurgis Banquet, that is after twelve o&rsquo;clock, midnight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, Shuna, Souei and Hakurou will be exploring Clayman&rsquo;s base soon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s almost twelve o&rsquo;clock midnight soon, I begin to ask Veldora about the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in those nobodies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he said that, Veldora still shared his knowledge on the subject.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon is the only one who became a Demon Lord after Veldora was sealed. This means I can collect information regarding the rest of the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many Demon Lords seemed to have fought against Veldora due to him causing havoc around the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Around two thousand years ago, he once destroyed the city of vampire. He was pursued by the pissed off vampires. And its story seems to be quite interesting&hellip; It seems that one of them was a slim and beautiful female vampire whose power is far beyond the rest of her race. These vampires later disappear without a trace, and even Veldora doesn&rsquo;t seem to know of their whereabout.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name now&hellip;was it Ru&hellip;Lulus? No, or it should be Milus, right? (D: The name is still wrong btw) Anyhow, though I didn&rsquo;t give it my all, she&rsquo;s still not some simpleton to have been able to play a round with me, so you&rsquo;ve got to be careful!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora says that vampire doesn&rsquo;t have a sense of humor, but, he&rsquo;s probably the one at fault.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course she would get pissed seeing her own country getting destroyed and burning to ashes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyone would get pissed by it, even I would have lashed out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that&rsquo;s a long time ago, so I&rsquo;m not sure about that now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, about that, now a man called Valentine has become the Demon Lord!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris shouts, who has been listening to Veldora recalling ancient tales.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems the exchange of power took place around fifteen thousand years ago. Hopefully the hatred against Veldora held by the vampire race has died off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Titan race Demon Lord also seemed to be a strong opponent against Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They&rsquo;ve fought several times without a definitive winner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No wonder why Veldora has his name memorized, he sounds like a super duper extrememo bananaz fighter (D: Anymore adjective, Gavin?). If he was able to fight against Veldora, it means he already possessed power to rival a &ldquo;True Dragon&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is very high leveled even for Demon Lord standards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lastly, it&rsquo;s the Demon race.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seems to have beaten up the demons several times. But even with their bodies destroyed, they would resurrect after a period of time. They seem to be a group of very interesting opponents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they even grew stronger over time, which gave Veldora a fun plaything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, he didn&rsquo;t seem to have fought against the king of the demon race.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His castle is rumored to be located on the permanently frozen land of the northern continent. The place is too cold to habitable, which is why Veldora never visited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora glossed over this part saying: &ldquo;Anyhow, that type of wasteland is not worth my visit! Gahahahaha!&rdquo; as he laughs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something must have happened, but no matter how I inquire, he just won&rsquo;t tell me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there really isn&rsquo;t a need to go out of your way to visit that kind of place, so I won&rsquo;t follow it up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, because Guy is very strong. Guy, Milim and I are all ancient Demon Lords!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as Ramiris said that, I begin to feel that there is nothing great about them. Unbelievable. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyway, that won&rsquo;t matter for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm, so that&rsquo;s about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How many Demon Lords are left?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve encountered&mdash;Milim, Ramiris and Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve just heard about Valentine, Dagruel and Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Phobio, there is also Frey who backstabbed Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Putting Leon aside first, the enemy this time is Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So is there still one more person?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehhh&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The self-proclaimed knowledgeable Veldora sure is unreliable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, you mean Dino. The Demon Lord who&rsquo;s lazier than me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So Ramiris seems to have a comrade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not comrade at all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I ignore her angry shout. That makes up ten in total.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora has provoked some Demon Lords in the past, so I have to be careful in how I interact with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, the Demon Lords seem to be more powerful than I imagined.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not fair to use a brat like Ramiris as a standard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s probably more appropriate to have Milim as the standard. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with my evolution now, I still wouldn&rsquo;t have much chance against Milim in battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve spared against her several times by now, but in none of our matches did Milim show her true power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Insufficient information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can stand a chance if Milim is participating in a training with me, but I&rsquo;d better not get over myself not knowing how she is when she gets serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it is still unbelievable that Milim would agree to wage a crusade on me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There must be someone behind this&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim shouldn&rsquo;t be so naive as to allow herself to be manipulated like this. She wasn&rsquo;t communicating with that many people in the first place, moreover, her personality doesn&rsquo;t seem like the kind to betray others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All I can think of it&rsquo;s that Milim has done this because of some unknown reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it&rsquo;s no use thinking about this now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll decide after I meet her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we continued to chat, I sudden feel a distortion in the space dimension before me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem our guide arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A bizarre door appears before my eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The door looks extremely extravagant as if someone is trying to show off intentionally. I could probably learn this given I could manipulate space directly. I think if I come up with a design like this, I could open the portal faster and proceed with &ldquo;Transportation&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A green-hair beauty in dark red maid suit walked through as the door is open.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she bows towards Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to escort you Ramiris-sama. Is this the one you&rsquo;ve mentioned about? If you don&rsquo;t mind, please come along with us too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she finishes, she steps back to stand near the door and lowers her eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seems to have killed her sense of self and behaves like a professional with thorough education and training.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there is one thing I had on my mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This maid gives off an oppressive feeling similar to Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is a Demon, and a highly ranked one among the race.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally Demons have an upper limit at the rank of Greater Demon General no matter how long they&rsquo;ve lived. In order to evolve further, certain things are necessary&hellip; In the case of Diablo, it is me giving him a &ldquo;Name&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With name acquired, Diablo was able to break through the limit of Demon race and evolved from a Greater Demon General to a Demon Noble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu. I&rsquo;m not interested in becoming stronger. But right now that I am aware that there are people stronger than me. I should give it some effort in the future then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is not interested in becoming stronger but is instead interested in fighting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Combat is simply meaningless if I get too strong, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve enjoyed my evolution cap&mdash;That&rsquo;s how he put it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was he joking?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s true, then he sure is horrifying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And right now the Demon maid that stands in front of me is the same as Diablo&mdash;That is, a Demon Noble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rather than a maid, she is more like a messenger from hell</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to knowledge (anime that I&rsquo;ve watched) from my past life, maid is also a battle-oriented class. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, allow me to re-emphasize, she is a Demon Noble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This woman is obviously a dangerous opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Misery. Long time no see! How&rsquo;s Guy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind despite the other side being a dangerous Demoness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In some way, this fella is not some simpleton as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;how would someone as humble as me dare to worry about my master&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yeah. You are still the same. Never mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, Ramiris flaps her wings and flies to the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We followed as well. If we are to be left here, we won&rsquo;t know where the exact location of the Banquet is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we are to hesitate now after solidifying our resolve, I would be too embarrassed to see Benimaru and the rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And about this maid&mdash;Misery, she seems to be Demon Lord Guy&rsquo;s subordinate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I recall that he is the king of the Demons, and one of the ancient Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he&rsquo;s able to tame even Demon Noble, he is guaranteed to be strong. I&rsquo;d better not antagonize him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;But it will still depend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And speaking of which, Misery who&rsquo;s already overpowered is supposed to lead way for other&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem that Guy is quite the arrogant man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I here thought that the only ones who I should be vigilant against are the Demon Lords, I think I was being too naive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I had known this, maybe I would have brought Diablo. But if I did, there may be a solid chance of him rampaging with Shion&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those two are on bad terms and it&rsquo;s no use thinking about it now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s time to show my resolve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The dominators of this world are waiting ahead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I am not afraid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is because&mdash;I have become one of those people who are the strongest in this world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I made up my mind and walk past the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru smiles looking at the situation on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything is going according to his plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The enemies have been baited into the traps set by Geld.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that is only natural. Since the enemies were totally underestimating them during combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sasuga Rimuru-sama, your plan is so perfect that our defeat here seems impossible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru said to himself while pitying the enemies. Benimaru doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s anything since he&rsquo;s only able to execute on the strategy because he is able to control the army to his will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like Benimaru said, Clayman&rsquo;s army seem to firmly believe that they have the advantage because of their numbers, which led them to underestimate us and fell into the traps. The fast-moving Beastmen soldiers who were disguising themselves as refugees being pursued lured them near the traps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The victory is within our grasp. As it stands now, it&rsquo;s impossible for the enemies pull a reversal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru is observing the battle while floating in midair when Alvis suddenly flew up next to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tapped the wings on his back and giving it extra thought as to not break Benimaru&rsquo;s concentration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see it is Alvis-san, sorry if you&rsquo;ve heard me boasting without victory, how embarrassing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please just call me Alvis, Benimaru-sama&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing this, Benimaru turn his scarlet red eyes towards Alvis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are not my subordinate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru refuses coldly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;indeed, you have a point. But, right now you are the commander giving orders of us Beastmen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">as such, Benimaru nods.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very well, then for this battle only, I shall appoint you as adjutant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I accept your order, Benimaru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The authority to command the united army belongs to Benimaru. And as of this moment, the person in charge of leading the army of Beast Kingdom Yuurazania, Alvis, proclaims her allegiance to Benimaru, which makes Benimaru the Generalissimo of this united army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words of the Generalissimo cannot be doubted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The pursuit of the strong, that is the rule of the monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;ve appointed you as adjutant, but right now there is not much work to do. I won&rsquo;t get careless, but all these operations are to ensure our victory.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, I think so too. However, there are still several strong opponents left on the battlefield.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, once we have the situation under control, I&rsquo;ll send in Geld and the rest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru answers without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please hold on. We also want to help in regard to that mission!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. I hope you won&rsquo;t take away our glory, Generalissimo. This is after all the kingdom of the beastmen. Karion-sama would scold us if we just leave everything to you guys.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes! Since you all have even taken on the task of confirming Karion-sama&rsquo;s whereabout, I hope we will at least get to fight this battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia and Phobio interrupt, become increasingly more excited. Alvis gives off a wry smile seeing how this is and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru-sama, we will leave the task of commanding the army to you, but please order us to take the heads of enemy generals!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon saying so, the Beastketeers bows with respect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru smacks his lip with a &ldquo;Ze&rdquo; sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you guys made me the Generalissimo because of this, right?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara, what do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Benimaru is losing his temper, Alvis begins to persuade him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At last Benimaru&rsquo;s willing to compromise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright. I was planning to have you guys join in the fight anyway, so no problem. But you must retreat immediately if you feel uncertain about your victory. Some very dangerous individuals seem to be lurking in the enemies&rsquo; troop.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He speaks permitting the actions of Alvis and the rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a matter of fact, the combat abilities of several enemies are still unknown. There may be difficult fights once they encounter these individuals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">It won&rsquo;t matter since I&rsquo;m here. As long as I can sense if someone is in a tough fight, we won&rsquo;t lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru smiles fearlessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Beastketeers also begin to select their prey. They are sharpening their claws with their proud animal instinct in order to eliminate the barbaric intruders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The traps would be activated in just a few minutes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis waits patiently for the moment to arrive. Suddenly she thought of a question and asks:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;There is one thing I need ask. What do we do with those who run into the traps?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We kill them all, is what I wish to say&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru got stuck there and gave it an extra thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But we will leave the decision of killing or not to you Beastmen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And what do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We will capture those who don&rsquo;t plan on resisting. Although Rimuru may look it based on how he acts but he is in fact a kindhearted person who doesn&rsquo;t like to kill off other people. But with that being said, if there are casualties in our side, he would most definitely slaughter the enemies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip; I see. Then we will discuss the fate of the captives later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, that would be fine. If it&rsquo;s Rimuru-sama, he may let those people serve time as worker.&rdquo;(Sweat shop)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you guys going to rebuild the Beastmen cities? The more labor the better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To be able to think that far ahead&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s random conclusion shocked Alvis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only her, Phobio and Suphia are also very surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They all thought that it is only natural for Rimuru&rsquo;s army to win, but the fact that he also made considerations for the aftermath truly surprised them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">He is so confident! Even when the enemies are all veterans under the cunning Demon Lord Clayman&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The more surprising fact is that his attack plan has taken the precautions to bring the enemies into captivity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Given how war works in this world, it is much simpler to kill the enemies rather than pursuing and capturing them. The commander won&rsquo;t care for any surrenders when he can just use a large radius magical attack to wipe them all out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The captives are not captured because they happen to survive, instead they are captured as forced labor. This idea has never been seen in practice before. However, Benimaru and the rest seem to think this to be common sense and put it into practice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This makes the Beastketeers feel extremely fearful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would mean&mdash;Majins under Rimuru don&rsquo;t think they would be defeated at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They must have entered the battlefield with the confidence that their army would win no matter what.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, it would be based on the condition that everything goes smoothly according to our attack plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru smiles and answers while the Beastketeers both respects and fear him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And soon, the fight broke out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Souei, engage according to the plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood, Benimaru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soon after this brief conversation, the first casualty appeared within Clayman&rsquo;s army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems to be a named Majin who&rsquo;s leading several hundred other Majins. His died instantly at the scene as his magical core was pierced by Souka who suddenly emerged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other four subordinates of Souei also simultaneously took the heads of the other captains under Clayman&rsquo;s army. Following Benimaru&rsquo;s instructions, they&rsquo;ve only assassinated opponents that they are confident enough to win against.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They followed through on Benimaru&rsquo;s instructed actions and achieved a one hundred percent precision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the command chains of Clayman&rsquo;s army is now shattered to pieces, the officers&rsquo; order won&rsquo;t be able to reach the soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trap! We&rsquo;ve been surrounded by the Beastmen!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way, how could this&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Retreat! We have to retreat for now to reorganize our troop!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they discovered it too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike human army, the monster army often relies on personal performance, which is why a captain is needed. Now without the captions, Clayman&rsquo;s army has plunged into chaos.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Geld, you may begin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Benimaru&rsquo;s order, Geld begins to dispatch his commands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Prepare to engage!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next instant, the ground suddenly collapses onto itself, burying many soldiers from Clayman&rsquo;s army. This is because of the activation of earth manipulating skills. The seemingly natural and flat plain is in fact a temporary ground that was set up using skills with many traps hidden within. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only ones who successfully escaped are the flying monsters. However these individuals with flying abilities couldn&rsquo;t escape either as they are soon taken down by the Bird-Type Beastmen troops and the &rdquo;Hiryuu&rdquo; led by Gabiru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now let&rsquo;s check on the ones who triggered the traps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rimuru&rsquo;s army has prepared large cave with quicksand</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;like soil at the bottom. This is non-lethal but would render anyone sunken into it unable to move below their waist. But with that being said, this is an army of monsters after all. Some people managed to escape using magic and other special abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As they struggle the strong kick aside the weak making them fall down to the bottom. The remainder now gather around the edges of the cave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this is an important part of the plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru&rsquo;s army has intentionally allowed them up to make examples of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When the stronger ones in the army are killed without being able to defend themselves, reality of the situation would lay out the in front of the others. The weaker Majins would witness this and lose their morale. The survivors would understand the difference in power between the enemy and themselves, losing their last bit of strength to struggle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The nature of these traps are a stage set-up in order to successfully capture captives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ten minutes passed after the fight began and the situation is one-sided. The enemy is unable to reverse the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;T-to have gone to this extent&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Below them, Clayman&rsquo;s army with more than ten-thousand people are split off to chunks with countless fallen into traps. The Yellow Corps led by Geld are responsible for fortifying the edges of the caves. The members of the corp spread out in evenly around the traps to take care of any Majin that attempted climbed up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ones who are cut off can&rsquo;t fight against the many enemies above. Although the difference in power may be compensated by number and equipment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the more powerful Majins have been taken out one by one at the hands of the Beastmen warriors and members of the &ldquo;Kurenai&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is even more unfortunate that most of Clayman&rsquo;s army has attacked the plain with an open view. Even the remaining troops with around a thousand men awaiting order (cannot participate) won&rsquo;t be sufficient to reverse the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We are guaranteed to win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;S-sasuga&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru says naturally while Alvis expresses praise from her heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh, of course we will win. But we can&rsquo;t get careless now. I&rsquo;ll take care of the business at hand. Alvis and the Beastketeers, I permit you to roam freely and hunt down the enemy general!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for that order, Generalissimo! Then we shall be on our way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can finally put on a show. I&rsquo;ve caught scent of someone who once plotted against me so I&rsquo;m going after him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, I shall set out too. I&rsquo;ll leave the rest to you, Benimaru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru doesn&rsquo;t even return a look and directly addressed the Beastketeers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, the Beastketeers begin to mobilize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia crosses the skyline at incredible speed, so fast that it has already surpassed conventional flying methods.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her skill &ldquo;Shuttled Flight&rdquo; could be only be wielded by very few competent monsters, yet Suphia, as a Beastman, is able to use it effortlessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her target is the furthest line of the enemy force. That is where the non-military organization that has little to do with the frontline of the battlefield is located.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are the Worshiper of Dragons&mdash;The Priest Warrior Order led by the High Priest Midley.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia hasn&rsquo;t discovered their true power, but her wild instinct told herself that these people are the strongest among the remaining forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time, the leader of the flying soldiers greets Suphia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s Gabiru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabiru, who is leading the hundred members of &ldquo;Hiryuu&rdquo;, decided to follow Suphia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gahahaha! I&rsquo;ve come at your aid, Suphia-san!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Gabiru-san. Sorry, but I may have made a horrible decision choosing to pick a fight with these guys.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia responds, her bold smile only adds to her beautiful face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHAHA, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. We&rsquo;ve cleared out all the enemies in the sky. Some Beastmen are capable of flying, so it would be rude if we continue to rob them of their duty. Moreover, since we are winning, aren&rsquo;t the enemies all fleeing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ha! Our army is indeed winning. But just to be cautious to prevent the situation from being reversed, we&rsquo;ve got to suppress the forces on the back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, understood! You guys, be cautious!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, boss!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;d say the same to Boss, don&rsquo;t get tilted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing his subordinates&rsquo; teasing faces, Gabiru shouts at them in anger. This scene often plays out in life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia smiles upon seeing such a scene. Her fighting spirits gradually grow high as she faces towards the enemy in front.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley has positioned his force in the safe zone behind the back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They aren&rsquo;t exactly a military force, but instead they became part of the support team at the back. It would be more accurate to call them the medical squad that is operating away from the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They didn&rsquo;t volunteer to enter the battlefield, but the notion of being looked down by others would make Midley too ashamed to see Milim again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">If that&rsquo;s the case, even Milim-sama would be looked down upon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley felt anxious about it and propose that they join the frontline as well. Yet Yamza rejected his proposal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s obvious that he does not care for Midley and his party, instead, he simply doesn&rsquo;t wish to share his victory with anyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Surely the conquest this time would be successful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The enemy is only one third of Yamza&rsquo;s army, a band of loose troops at that. There is no way they can launch a counter-attack while trying to protect the retreating refugees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">It doesn&rsquo;t feel honorable to be fighting this type of opponents&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley changed his mind these few days went by.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the situation has took an unexpected turn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Midley-sama, this is really bad&hellip; If we are to continue fighting, do we even have a chance to win?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Welp&hellip;hmmm. Too weak, they are just too weak. So Demon Lord Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates are that weak&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No no no, it&rsquo;s not like that! The enemies have outsmarted us with tactics!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What! You idiot, if the enemy resorted to tactics, all we have to do it&rsquo;s to beat them with our true power! The only reason why you are saying these weak things is because you are still too inexperienced, Hermes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said already! It&rsquo;s a different case if we are talking about a duel, but when it is a wide-scale battle with armies, the tactics will determine the outcome of the battle! This include how to trick and outsmart the enemies. Our opponents have won this time. They&rsquo;ve been hiding their strength until key moments and have prepared traps.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, no one needs you to explain that, anyone who&rsquo;s seen the battle would know!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley replies so while giving a snort of contempt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is no good with brainwork. While in contrast, Hermes a little clever, that&rsquo;s why he often says things Midley finds hard to understand. Midley is quite upset about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, consider how things have developed&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is on no grounds to argue back. Even Midley knows Hermes is right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sight in front of them is the best proof of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;More importantly, Midley-sama&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know. Those people are closing in on us and they are strong. Even though I don&rsquo;t want to fight, we are on the battlefield after all. Since the enemies are heading for us, we will keep them occupied till the end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So it really does turn out like this in the end. Understood&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley&rsquo;s spirit burns high as he glances at Hermes, who unwillingly accepted the reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the corner of the battlefield, the back of Clayman&rsquo;s army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most intense fights of the battle are about to begin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Phobio lands on the ground and silently sprints through the field. He soon discovers the people hidden some distance away from the battlefield. Then he jumps in front of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are the man with the angry jester mask and the girl with the tearing jester mask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This bizarre duo is &mdash;&rdquo;Angry Clown (Angry Pierrot)&rdquo; Footman, &ldquo;Tearing Clown (Teardrop)&rdquo; Tear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are members of the Moderate Jester Association who are surveilling the battlefield at Clayman&rsquo;s request.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, thanks for taking care me before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Phobio suppresses his anger and speaks up calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Isn&rsquo;t this Phobio-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Behind the angry jester masks, a pair of evil eyes are glowing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Demon-Lord-wannabe Phobio-sama, lost-to-Milim Phobio-sama! Thanks for your help back then!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The girl wearing tearing jester mask mocks at Phobio, looking down on him hard while greeting him while spinning and singing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s great that you both remember me. It would be really sad if you don&rsquo;t even know why you&rsquo;ll die at my hands!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eheheh? What are you angry at?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How strange. What is this baka angry at? That angry emotion smells very tasty, but it isn&rsquo;t enough reason to kill us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, right!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cut the nonsense! I may be an idiot for being tricked by others, but an idiot has an idiot&rsquo;s way. I don&rsquo;t need a reason to get my revenge!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a matter of dignity. Phobio unleashes his sharp claws.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those claws are so dark as to shine and are also sharp and ferocious like wolfs&rsquo; teeth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Tear and Footman didn&rsquo;t seem to react even seeing his claws.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh~Do you want to fight us? But you are so weak, better not get ahead of yourself!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&mdash;hehehe. I&rsquo;m dying here, Tear. Phobio-sama come here specially to joke around, trying make us laugh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two goes on with their chat, but that didn&rsquo;t lead Phobio to lose his cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He failed once because he was too easily angered. He&rsquo;s done more self-reflection on the matter more than anyone and with much regrets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So he begins his action at once as if announcing that greeting time is over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He breaks into a run and closes in on the enemies at high speed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Oh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ze!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Footman and Tear changes their attitudes now knowing words won&rsquo;t irritate him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides&mdash;There has been an intervention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the space begins to warp, a man shaped like a pig walks in from mid-air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Long time no see, Footman. Do you remember me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? Oh my? What an honor it is to have the orc general arrive here. Wow, you&rsquo;ve really grown handsome!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Footman speaks with mockery, yet his expression is not as relaxed as his words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In contrast to how he looks, Footman is good at mind games.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Geld has seen through his true personality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When his troops destroyed Benimaru and his companions&rsquo; hometown&mdash;Tribe of Ogre, the one who accompanied them was Footman. Geld knew then already that he is not to be underestimated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Footman is unlike any other normal Majin, Geld thinks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Plus that Tear is also present as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s around Footman&rsquo;s level. Since her true strength is unknown, this opponent cannot be underestimated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if the Beastketeer from Beast King Warrior Army, &ldquo;Black Panther Tooth&rdquo; Phobio, has very strong ability, he would still have a hard time dealing with both Footman and Tear alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Hehe, as expected of Benimaru-san, these people are worthy of being my prey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he thinks that, Geld is also extremely eager.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru learnt of the situation from above and ordered him to assist Phobio. Geld was originally frowning since the order required him to give up his commanding post on the battlefield, but only now did he realize how accurate Benimaru&rsquo;s prediction was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The outcome on that battlefield is already settled, even Geld&rsquo;s adjutant could handle things there. But in order to take on the duo from Moderating Jester Association, it would be a challenging task that only the veterans under Rimuru could handle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Allow me to assist you, Phobio-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh oh, Geld-san. Thanks for the help!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Phobio has also calmly judged the difference in strength between him and his opponents, that is likely why he didn&rsquo;t refuse Geld&rsquo;s proposition. He&rsquo;d rather put down his ego knowing what his limits are and choose the easiest path to win against his opponents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, in the dark side of the small hill next to the battlefield, the two parties would soon engage in their battle&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon receiving reports coming from the battlefields, Yamza has lost his footing. The absolute advantage that his army possessed so far has all been an illusion created for the enemies&rsquo; trap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza couldn&rsquo;t even imagine the prospect of his army being defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman would definitely loses his nerve, Yamza must find a way to turn things around and win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it is an idiot&rsquo;s dream considering the what remains of his forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza hasn&rsquo;t lost his ability reason yet, so he can at least realize that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He begins to think about what remaining force he can utilize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza the &ldquo;Middle Finger&rdquo; is the top lieutenant within Demon Lord Clayman&rsquo;s vanguards &ldquo;Five Fingers&rdquo; as well as the strongest Majin within Clayman&rsquo;s army. If anyone is to rival him, it would only be &ldquo;Index Finger&rdquo; Adalman and &ldquo;Thumb&rdquo; Nine-Head Beast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman is in charge of the defense force of Clayman&rsquo;s nation. He was an undead from the Great Jura Forest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seems to be a prominent clergyman when he&rsquo;s still alive, but it matters little in the afterlife. After being baptized with Clayman&rsquo;s curses and becoming a monster, he received a significant increase in power and became an Undead King that commands many undead creatures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His Holy power prior to his death has been turned into foul magic that curses the living&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Adalman has a weakness. His powerful body is accompanied by limited intelligence. That&rsquo;s why he would only follow Clayman&rsquo;s order&mdash;Killing invaders. It is the reason why he did not join the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The other one, Nine-Head Beast, is an extremely rare and high-level monster &ldquo;Youko&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span class="c1">. She&rsquo;s only three-hundred years old, relatively young for its race, and has only grown three tails. Yet her magicule reserves is far larger than Yamza, even rivalling Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now she is acting as Clayman&rsquo;s guard to attend the Walpurgis Banquet along his side. So she can&rsquo;t assist us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">&mdash;Alas, I have to ask Adalman for help then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the problem is&mdash;How is he supposed to get Adalman here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, no. There is no way I can bring him here. If that&rsquo;s the case, I should lead the remaining soldiers and flee back to Demon Lord Milim&rsquo;s territory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that I&rsquo;ll call Adalman and rendezvous with him, then we will fight our way back&mdash;That may be the best solution, Yamza thinks to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A Walpurgis Banquet may last for a month at times, it&rsquo;s a long time. And if he handles the situation well, he might even be able to resolve it before Clayman returns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not gonna be easy trying to order Adalman around, but he&rsquo;s got to take the first step even if it&rsquo;s hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter what, Yamza can&rsquo;t allow the situation to continue on and suffer a defeat, he would most definitely be punished if that&rsquo;s the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Clayman-sama is really scary and he would even go as far to get rid of me&hellip; I&rsquo;d be lucky to survive, but I don&rsquo;t want to be mentally destroyed and manipulated as a puppet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Even though I don&rsquo;t want to admit it, but I&rsquo;ve lost this battle. However, I&rsquo;ll be the one that stands triumphant in the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With his plan settled, Yamza looks towards the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There he witnesses a surprising sight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A beauty with black and golden hair is on the front, her face, beautiful and flirtatious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is approaching rather casually with golden khakkara in her hands as if she is entering a no man zone.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 643.50px; height: 890.84px;"><img alt="" src="images/image13.png" style="width: 643.50px; height: 890.84px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The top warriors of the Beast Kingdom surrounded her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are the Beast King Warrior Group&mdash;A group consisting of only several dozen people, yet the strength of the group is guaranteed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are warriors capable of fending off thousand by themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Including the Elephant Beastman Zar, Bear Beastman Talos and more, they are not as strong as the Beastketeers, yet they are nonetheless powerful lieutenants who are worthy subordinates of the King of Beasts. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from these Beastmen, there is also a red-clothes group following them. They are casting powerful and deadly fire magic and has burnt the reserved forces awaiting at the back to a crisp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These people are not worthy opponents to Yamza, but they are certainly better than his subordinates&mdash;much stronger than those Majins. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things just turn horrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Impossible&hellip; What are the Beastketeers doing here? Did these people leave their army to assist here by themselves? But, even if that&rsquo;s the case&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza begins to panic upon seeing the appearance of these unexpected people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why are the enemy sending their strongest force into our camp&mdash;? What the hell have the sentinels been up to&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The angry shouts of some of Yamza&rsquo;s lieutenants can be heard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza is not the only one feeling overwhelmed by the situation, many high-level Majins at the scene also began to panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry to intrude but! We are unable to contact the sentinels; we suspect they&rsquo;ve been killed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you say&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza&rsquo;s lieutenants shout while Yamza remains speechless. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The enemy is moving too to respond to. By the time they realize the situation they&rsquo;ve fallen far behind the opposition almost to a fatal degree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza completely loses his composure upon realizing this fact. Forget reorganizing and mounting a comeback, right now, just surviving and escaping challenging enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Not good, not good, not good, not good at all&mdash;! At this rate, I would be lucky just to escape here alive!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza becomes anxious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a one thing to have a duel, but Yamza is not delusional and narcissistic enough to fight against that army and expect himself to emerge triumphant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Buy me some time! I&rsquo;ll return to our country and bring Adalman. He would be able to summon the undead here and help our army regroup.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are all excuses. Yamza knows he&rsquo;ll lose, so he has made his decision to escape with all his might. Luckily Yamza pledged his loyalty to Clayman voluntarily, so he won&rsquo;t end up killed by contract (curse) unlike the rest of the Five Finger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Continuing to follow Clayman is no difference from suicide. Yamza made that decision and drew his line of loyalty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We will try our best to hold out for three more hours!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His lieutenants replied one by one with resolve written on their faces. Yet Yamza&rsquo;s decision remains unchanged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He only has only one thought&mdash;These people are all idiots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza decides to directly initiate teleportation magic&mdash;But as soon as he tries to cast the magic, he discovers something is wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;unable to activate? Is this&hellip;&rsquo;Dimensional Lock-down&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, it&rsquo;s all too late now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza and his men notices Alvis, who&rsquo;s also looking back at them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is through Alvis&rsquo; skill&mdash;&rdquo;Eyes of Heavenly Snake&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may only be an extra skill, but it is able to induce all types of negative status on enemies&mdash;paralysis, poison, madness etc.&mdash;It also has a horrifyingly wide area of effect, and one would be affected by the skill as soon as Alvis spots them. No one can escape it unless they could resist or endure the effects. it is an extraordinary skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, Alvis holds another trump card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is, her unique skill &ldquo;Suppressor&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is a dimensional skill with the effect of Thought Acceleration&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dimensional Manipulation&rdquo;,&rdquo;Dimensional Transportation&rdquo;. It can pose as an obstacle to the enemies&rsquo; movements in order to create situations that favors of her allies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once seen by Alvis, the regular soldiers under Yamza are all paralyzed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The weaker willed ones will go mad instantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even ones with some capabilities couldn&rsquo;t escape it either, they either have their bodies paralyzed or are poisoned to death. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some even got petrified. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are only less than a hundred men who escaped the fate. Alvis didn&rsquo;t give a fighting chance to the unworthy opponents before the actual fight even began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza&rsquo;s magic was neutralized with Alvis&rsquo; &ldquo;Dimensional Manipulation&rdquo;, It is not a disruption to the magic he casted, but instead, she locked down the coordinates of the space around Yamza so as to prevent him from altering his nearby space using magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why no one could escape through magic in this surrounding area. The so called &ldquo;surrounding area&rdquo; refers to the area within Alvis&rsquo; eyesight. All of the surrounding battlefield is now under Alvis&rsquo; control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is what the Beastketeer&mdash;&rdquo;Golden Snake Horn&rdquo; Alvis is capable of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unable to escape, Yamza grinds his teeth hard as he realizes his situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he has kept a trick up his sleeve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, that is a forbidden technique that Yamza wishes to avoid using.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, he must engage the enemy in order to survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;It can&rsquo;t be helped. I guess I&rsquo;ll get serious with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh oh, Yamza-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Yamza-sama is to get serious, even the three Beastketeers won&rsquo;t stand a chance against him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fight to the end! Now it&rsquo;s our time to shine and carry out Clayman-sama&rsquo;s will!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The subordinates regained some morale.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What a bunch of idiots, Yamza ponders to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demon Lord Clayman only wants to profit from their victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To suffer so many losses on top of losing the war, Clayman surely will not let Yamza and his men walk free.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">That man only believes in power&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how loyal is Yamza, Clayman would never recognize him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would only treat him as a useful pawn and a competent subordinate to adore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is even the case with the Special Frost Magic Sword that Clayman gifted to Yamza. His intent is to make Yamza stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, Clayman does everything for himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even so, Yamza still respects Clayman. His sharing of wealth with Yamza benefits him too as they both stand to profit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Yamza doesn&rsquo;t intend to sacrifice his life for Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&#65288;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">&hellip;It&rsquo;s about time. I will survive and rise up again someday!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would go into hiding after meeting his waterloo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said given his strength as a Special A ranked Greater Majin, other Demon Lords would definitely be willing to take him in&mdash;Yamza thinks so to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Interesting. Alvis, Majin of the Beast King, fierce Beastketeer, do you wish to fight me one on one me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He fires off a strong force of will towards Alvis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He makes his bet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He will defeat the strongest opponent Alvis to sink the enemies&rsquo; morale. He may even be able to reverse the situation by doing so. But even if that doesn&rsquo;t pan out, he could still create the opportunity he needs to escape himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sure, no problem. Strongest fighter of Demon Lord Clayman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Five Fingers&rdquo;, Yamza-dono. Let&rsquo;s find out our difference in strength!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This can also illustrate the difference in character between Clayman and Karion-sama&mdash;That&rsquo;s the other reason why Alvis accepted his invitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She uses &ldquo;Dimensional Transportation&rdquo; to move towards Yamza. The surviving Clayman&rsquo;s soldiers thrust towards her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is not even worthy of being called a tactic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beastmen are simple creature, once provoked they would fight to the death. Yamza tried to exploit such nature and planned out this despicable trickery.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as they try to exhaust Alvis&rsquo; stamina, Yamza would have an easier time winning. His subordinates launched their attack based on that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fool, there&rsquo;s no use in using such dirty tricks on me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis shouts in response and activates her &ldquo;Eyes of Heavenly Snake&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But for Yamza, that was all he needed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment Alvis activates her skill was also the chance of winning that Yamza&rsquo;s been waiting for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Diiiie!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He suddenly moves towards his enemy and swings his sword towards Alvis&rsquo; back, where she neglected to defend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the sword swings closer and closer to Alvis&rsquo; back&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nice thinking! You don&rsquo;t deserve to be a man by using such despicable trickery!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man who shouted that jumps out of Alvis&rsquo; shadow and deflected Yamza&rsquo;s sword. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh, who are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am Gobta! I&rsquo;ve been hiding inside (the shadow) in case of emergency.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Gobta was explaining, more people gradually jump out of the shadow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is obvious now that they are the Goblin Rider units who now moved on all fours after &ldquo;Union&rdquo;. By utilizing their high mobility, they scattered to engage the several Majins around who are still able to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara, you&rsquo;ve even kept me in the dark. No wonder I&rsquo;ve been feeling something weird this whole time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite Alvis saying that, she has in reality noticed them long ago. That&rsquo;s why she reassuringly walked into the enemies alone, knowing someone got her back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh heh, we&rsquo;ve been sent by Benimaru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta casually replies to Alvis while secretly pointing and activating his sheath railgun at Yamza. He has realized the difference in power between the him and Yamza, and that he is no match for Yamza when he deflected Yamza&rsquo;s sword, That&rsquo;s why he determined that this is a great opportunity to strike when Yamza is still keeping his distance and weary of his kodachi.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Gobta has the phrase &ldquo;Fair and Just&rdquo; in his dictionary, but his understanding is a bit different than what common sense would dictate in that it is something to demand from the opponent but not something he would give.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta fires his sneak attack but was deflected by Yamza&rsquo;s sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Trash! Get out of my way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza points the tip of his sword at Gobta and casts his magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza launches the Great Magic Water Ice Canon at Gobta, while Gobta launches the same thing back at him using his kodachi.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta did not launch the attack as a counter but rather as a follow up to his initial sneak attack. But the magic saved Gobta&rsquo;s life as the two canon beam collides with each other mid-air and fizzles out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;huh, how could that be as powerful as my magic sword? And even without chanting? How can a lowly trash be so arrogant&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From that point onward, Yamza begins to treat Gobta as an enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Gobta is out of tricks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Oh no, his reaction was so fast I didn&#39;t even catch up with it. I was saved because he happened to launch that magic too. If I was stabbed, I would be dead by now. I guess it&rsquo;s time for my escape!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are his real thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thankfully the Goblin Rider units have made some progress, that&rsquo;s retreating now won&rsquo;t net him a bad reputation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hence Gobta decides to retreat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s retrea&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as he was just about to give out the order, Yamza&rsquo;s sword was thrusted above Gobta nose tip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;KYAAAA!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But lady luck has smiled on him once more, as Gobta narrowly avoided death once again due to him having an unstable and tilted posture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this made Yamza&rsquo;s more wary of Gobta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Did he seriously just dodge three of my attacks?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can&rsquo;t be a coincidence if he can do it three times in a roll. Yamza concludes. After all, his super-sonic attack has indicated this sigh&mdash;The Hobgoblin in front him is no ordinary monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, it seems that the Beastketeer has also fallen so low to be sneaking in reinforcement in a duel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza shouts out with bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is also one of his tricks. Now not only the Beastketeer, some unknown individual has come to interfere, he thinks it would be too dangerous to deal with them both.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta on the other hand is thrilled at the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">This is great! Now I don&rsquo;t need to fight this dangerous Majin anymore!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hides his joy and takes action swiftly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I shall be the referee of this duel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta proclaims.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now he&rsquo;s just a referee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s better off this way as he would just be a hindrance out there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru allows them to fail but dying in battle is strictly forbidden. But Gobta is not that dumb, not dumb enough to become the first one to die for such a dishonorable cause.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara, I ok with leaving him for you to fight!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis intentionally teased, but Gobta rejects it with ease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How could you let others have your prey, that would tarnish the good name of the Beastmen! So I won&rsquo;t fight over him with you, please do what you wish! Sorry for the interrupting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The luckiest thing of all is, Gobta&rsquo;s bizarre responses actually worked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza is able to avoid the unknown danger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis wasn&rsquo;t planning on giving up on her prey anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Gobta&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">AHH&mdash;YEAH! Now my mission is complete!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He got to escape from having to fight the super strong opponent not to mention that it&rsquo;s a fight he had no chance of winning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the back of the enemy force, the end of the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Priests Warriors led by High Priest Midley are engaging in an intense battle against the &ldquo;Hiryuu&rdquo; led by Gabiru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said however, there are only a few people who remain standing on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two hundred people from both side in total are almost all lying on the ground now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Among them, Midley didn&rsquo;t receive a single scratch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even his white tidily worn vestment is without a single dirt stain. He also claims to be extremely lively.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WH&mdash;&mdash;HAHAHA! You guys really are something. As expected from the children of dragon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley laughs delightfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was focusing his eyes on the people lying on the ground while ignoring the Suphia panting heavily in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just treat me like air!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia activated &ldquo;Transformation&rdquo;(Beastilization) and entered a state of half human half beast. Her improved bodily function now rivals Midley. However, her intention has been seen through by Midley as he begins to dodge sideways to keep his distant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia missed her chance to strike and left herself exposed with openings all over her body, giving Midley the perfect chance to strike.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eat this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He grabs her sharp clawed hands that was coming for him while tripping her feet and carries Suphia over his shoulder&mdash;then with a quick and hard throw, thrusted her towards the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a lot like a Judo throw, it is the unique throwing technique passed down by generations within the Worshippers of Dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t treating you like air. After all, I don&rsquo;t get much chances to use this technique on monster, so I&rsquo;m quite fond of it as well. I have not met a worthy opponent like you to throw for a long time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;(ara, muggy was here)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley says so with joy, but Suphia, who just got thrown by other couldn&rsquo;t bear her anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Woo, damniit! H-How dare you do this to me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her opponent is clearly treating her like a plaything. Suphia&rsquo;s face reddened out of the humiliation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she has to admit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man standing in front of her named Midley is strong beyond her imagination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the party in question Midley begins to ignore Suphia again and starts to glance around. He&rsquo;s waiting for Suphia to get back on her feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Damnit, he&rsquo;s totally ignoring me! And my &ldquo;Automatic Regeneration&rdquo; for some reason is not activating&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, Suphia has not sustained any damage to her body, that&rsquo;s why the healing skill is not activated. The reason why she feels exhausted is simply the draining of her stamina.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One&rsquo;s body would feel exhausted by the impact force after being thrown on the ground by others. There is no damage to the outside, yet it would traumatize the body&rsquo;s interior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Suphia stands up again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is the Beastketeer&mdash;&rdquo;White Tiger Fang&rdquo; Suphia, and she won&rsquo;t allow her enemy to give her a one-sided beatdown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe someone like you serve under Clayman. I thought Yamza was the strongest, and my instinct is always quite on point.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yamza&hellip; You mean Yamza-dono. That man is quite good himself, but not enough to be toyed by me. I may look the way I look, but I have Milim-sama as my sparring opponent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milim&hellip;Demon Lord Milim? That would mean, you guys are the Worshipers of Dragon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No wonder they are so strong, Suphia thinks to herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These people would seem too out of place if they are indeed Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They took great joy in battle and won&rsquo;t hesitate at all in killing. But most importantly, their power is much higher than the other Majins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? That Dragonoid has beaten Hermes! WHAHAHAHA, that&rsquo;s really something!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley laughs out delightfully as usual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes&rsquo; opponent is Gabiru, and just now, he got beaten the crap out of him by Gabiru&rsquo;s spear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, Midley-sama. Stop laughing, give me a hand already!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Idiot! You are the one who has lost. You better reflect yourself while staying there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes is lying on the ground while trying to beg Midley for help. Midley instead laughed it off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He probably has seen through that Hermes was holding back and that Gabiru didn&rsquo;t plan to kill Hermes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very well, now there are only three of us in total including me. You&rsquo;ve proven the skills of your soldiers by fighting to a draw with my warriors. It means that they have thoroughly trained their bodies and souls instead of relying on their skills.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I should be the delighted one bearing your compliments. I am Gabiru. And you are Milim-sama&rsquo;s&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm! I am the Worshiper of Dragon, Midley.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am Suphia. Beastketeer Suphia! I won&rsquo;t bother giving my name to Clayman&rsquo;s subordinate. But it&rsquo;s a different case of Milim-sama&rsquo;s subordinate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, Suphia-san, right? I&rsquo;ll remember that. Now then, what to do, what to do? Should I take on both of you now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he says so, Midley crosses his hands casually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His actions say much about his confidence that he won&rsquo;t lose even against them both.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Could I ask a question before we fight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nothing in particular, but how could a mere human be so strong? Or should I say, are Worshipers of Dragon really human? There&rsquo;s definitely something strange about this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having been asked by Suphia, Midley also nods intriguingly in response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then he makes his response:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The human you say&mdash;That is the issue. If you are raising a question regarding our race, then the answer is very simple. We are the same as Gabiru-san over there. We are all Dragonoids.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley proclaims as if it&rsquo;s nothing of significance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What!? You mean just like us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, indeed. The difference is we didn&rsquo;t evolve from lizard man. We are the offspring born through the merging of &rdquo;Humanoid&rdquo; Dragon and Humans. That&rsquo;s probably our difference.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we are the same in nature&mdash;Midley finishes his sentence with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why&hellip;speaking of that, my sister Souka also evolved to look like human.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No wonder, you guys are way too strong in terms of human standard&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That being the case, there are very few people left who can revert to our ancient appearance. None of my subordinates lying over there have gained any of those skills, such as &lsquo;Dragonization&rsquo; or &lsquo;Dragon Warrior Transformation&rsquo;. Nowadays, we are about the same as humans.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley looks at Suphia as he says so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, with this power inherited, we worship dragons to remind ourselves to not forget of the blood that runs in our body. Is that what you wish to know, Suphia-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are human or monster. I just want to know whether that toughness was trained and obtained by the weak humans, that&rsquo;s all. I should pay much respect to your efforts now that you mentioned you are no difference from humans.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHAHAHAHA, I hold the same thoughts. The so-called strength is divided into innate and trained. A Majin is weak if he relies too much on his own innate strength and measuring the strength of others based on their magicule possession. Real strength cannot be seen with eyes. The difference in skillfulness is the only correct criteria.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see&mdash;Suphia resonates such sentiment a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia was born strong. Even without any effort, her combat abilities are stronger than most monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most Majin would stay away seeing her huge amount of magicules and the Youki surrounding her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Through her agility in battle, she utilized her strength to the fullest in order to get to where she is today.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now with Midley&rsquo;s words, she realized that she hasn&rsquo;t been practicing her skills for all these times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other word, I can become stronger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHAHAHAHA, indeed. The best way to get stronger is through actual combats. Go ahead, I&rsquo;ll be your opponent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley stands looking calm as ever and says so while having his hands crossed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Should I join Suphia-san? Also, aren&rsquo;t you a bit narcissistic?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley gives off a smile as Gabiru says so, he then responses:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh! Young man, then I shall take down my hands and play with you two for a while!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since their opponent has come to this point, Gabiru would not stay silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Suphia-san&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, let&rsquo;s go. But I assure you, this guy is strong!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that, Gabiru and Suphia challenge Midley.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fight between Alvis and Yamza becomes more and more intensifies, and the moment to determine the outcome has finally arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the two in a stalemate, Yamza decides to use his trump card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, as expected of the Beastketeer! It&rsquo;s no easy feat to fight me to a draw. However, victory is mine with this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehe, did you really think this magic sword is my only trump card? You are good, and I&rsquo;ll admit that you are on par with me. But! What would happen when there are two me to fight you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he finishes his sentence, Yamza releases the magic of his left wrist ring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This wrist ring is the &ldquo;Clone Wrist Ring&rdquo;. It possesses the magic to spawn an exact replica of the user, it is a reputable and valuable treasure of a magical item.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Including gears, even the skills of the clone would be exactly the same as the summoner. In other words, Alvis must confront two Yamza at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the clone could rival the summoner, the situation is highly disadvantageous for Alvis. However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about it? I would consider sparing you if you surrender now&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you think you can beat me with such dirty trick? I see that the Majin serving Clayman is indeed just this low, what a crude ace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis doesn&rsquo;t seem to be moved and even mocks at Yamza.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Prepare to die then!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet Yamza couldn&rsquo;t finish his shout as Alvis reveals shows her trump card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her upper body resembles a beautiful female while her lower body is that of a dark serpent. That is Alvis&rsquo; real appearance. &rdquo;Beastilization&rdquo; has revealed Alvis&rsquo; natural appearance and granted her immense strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lot of people think unlike Phobio or Suphia who are good at close-quarter combat, Alvis is the long-range mage-type fighter skilled in casting magic attack from a distance. But it is the furthest from reality. She lives up to her name as the subordinate of Beast King and is most talented in close-quarter combat, a natural warrior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, her fighting style differs a lot with the other two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis raises her golden khakkhara above her head. The khakkhara disappears instantly as Golden horns appear on Alvis&rsquo; forehead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her suppressed Youki bursts out to the surrounding, indicating her immense growth in strength. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A double stage &ldquo;Transformation&rdquo;&mdash; That is Alvis&rsquo; trump card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With dragon scale armor covered all over her, Alvis stands before Yamza.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The space around the surrounding is now under Alvis&rsquo; complete control, her overflowing Youki begins to appear as purple lightning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta shouts in fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now Alvis doesn&rsquo;t seem to be differentiating friends and foes, so he feels he&rsquo;s in a life-threatening situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are Gobta, right? I&rsquo;ll grant you the permission to leave here at once.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run even without your permission.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone retreats! Gobta orders everyone and begins to flee with the Goblin Slayer units.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Idiot, do you want to take on us alone?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s looking down on us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The surviving Greater Majins begins to shout and surround Alvis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Alvis, who has revealed her true self, doesn&rsquo;t seem to give a single care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;AHAHAHAHAHA! Then die, you fools!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was too late when Yamza comes back to his senses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some Majins have collapse with blood pouring out of their mouths.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some Majins are petrified entirely and breaking into pieces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rest of the Majins&rsquo; bodies begin to corrode and were turned into dust on the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The difference in power is simply too large. Yamza&rsquo;s subordinates are all being consumed by negative effects, dying off one by one. Yamza couldn&rsquo;t do a thing to stop this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;B-bastard&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Combating in close quarter with her special method, that&rsquo;s Alvis&rsquo; most skilled fighting style.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Golden Snake Horn&rdquo;&mdash; Alvis&rsquo; Golden horns symbolize death. No living beings within this area could survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza finally realizes he has been completely defeated. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Surrender now. I&rsquo;ll have you as captive and allow you to live if you surrender.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis proposes. He may only survive by accepting her conditions. That&rsquo;s because, his &ldquo;Clone Wrist Ring&rdquo; has been broken the moment Alvis&rsquo; &ldquo;Eyes of Heavenly Snake&rdquo; laid on it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems to also be able to destroy equipment, and Yamza&rsquo;s clone vanishes before the fight even started.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">&mdash;My hands and feet are also paralyzed. If this is to continue, I&rsquo;ll even have trouble fighting&hellip; How in the world is the Beastketeer this strong?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza was unlucky, since Alvis is the strongest Beastketeer among the three.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has picked the wrong opponent. But he&rsquo;s not aware of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis is often entrusted the role as commander, so she rarely utilizes her power. That&rsquo;s why to the outside world, even though she is the head of the Beastketeers, she&rsquo;s still often underestimated/</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza is one of them, looking down on Alvis from his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The outcome has been determined. However, it is not over yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is a cunning Demon Lord that will never allow his subordinates to betray&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I just need to accept her proposition. Yamza makes up his mind&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;How would I ever allow you to do that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman&rsquo;s voice begins to echo in Yamza&rsquo;s heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza exclaims out of surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His body begins to act on its own without his control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;S-stop! Please don&rsquo;t do this, Clayman-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamza takes out an ominous dark purple orb and bring it to his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wu-Gu!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He grinds his teeth tight, trying to avoid getting near that object, but&hellip;These are futile resistances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman has inserted skill &ldquo;Puppeteer&rdquo; in him, so Yamza&rsquo;s body is not following his command.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;What are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis is confused as Yamza is being forced to swallow that object.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To swallow the dark purple orb&mdash;Fragment of Charybdis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ha? Ha-pu, wugugu&hellip;GWHAAAAAAAAA&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The confused Alvis has her nerve tightened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In front of her, Yamza&mdash;his tentacles begin to reach out towards the corpses surrounding him as his body begins to expand into something abominable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having been affected by the dimensions filled with magicules under Alvis&rsquo; control, Yamza&rsquo;s magicule storage begins to expand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There begins a blizzard of ice snows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As it consumes and expands, and explodes in the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is a consuming-type monster that lacks the &ldquo;Core&rdquo; of a monster and would disappear after its rampage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though it could only last for a while, its power is compatible to the one it originates from. That&rsquo;s likely the most challenging part that it&rsquo;s this character. Its appetite to consume is endless just like its originator (Yamza).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is the forbidden technique Yamza didn&rsquo;t want to use, a clever trap set by Clayman.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Charybdis is reborn to this land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis&rsquo; nerves are extremely tense as she attacks Charybdis with all she can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet she couldn&rsquo;t harm it. Charybdis continues to expand, and her normal attacks won&rsquo;t even leave a scratch on it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most challenging part is no more than &ldquo;Super Regeneration&rdquo;. It would absorb the corpses around it to regenerate temporary flesh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehhh, you monster!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis shouts with hatred, as her proud skill &ldquo;Eyes of Heavenly Snake&rdquo; won&rsquo;t work on it and her purple lightning has a weak effect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Regarding that, this monster is already Calamity-level, a monster with many levels higher than herself. Even if Alvis is the strongest among the three Beastketeers, she won&rsquo;t be able to take on it by herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thankfully there is still quite the distance from where she is and the battlefield. Alvis wants to buy some time, so it won&rsquo;t affect her companions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that is at most until Charybdis completes creating its body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its horrifying collective body in the form of desperation now rampages this land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, this monster isn&rsquo;t satisfied with consuming Yamza, it even swallowed the Magic Frost Sword in order to search for its &ldquo;Core&rdquo;. It is thus drawing in heat from the surrounding and causing a temperature drop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The monster is turning its Youki into a Giant Water Ice Storm and causing a havoc there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way the Ice Storm swallows and harms the surrounding people and objects indeed is horrifying to watch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">More severely, what concerns Alvis is what would happen the moment it releases all the heat it absorbed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">It&rsquo;s fine for those who can escape with teleportation skill, but as for those without it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone would die.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damnit! That bastard Clayman&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis shows her true character as she shouts and continuously launches attack on the enemy without interval.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She launched it so frequently to the point of not sparing a single breath.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of these efforts have been futile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Charybdis has only sustained some flesh wound, the damage to its core is less than significant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, it&rsquo;s because it is regenerating too fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Blasted! I&rsquo;ll have to let those who can run retreat first&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In time of desperate, Alvis tries to come up with a best solution to her situation. She was going to request Benimaru to issue the order for fast retreat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In terms of result, the order was not issued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s because&mdash;there is no such need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve disobeyed me, Alvis. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to retreat if you can&rsquo;t win?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that said, Generalissimo Benimaru suddenly appears before Alvis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Benimaru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, Charybdis. I couldn&rsquo;t harm it last time, but what about this time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru shows an arrogant smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru-sama, this monster is too&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know. It&rsquo;s quite impressive, now I could use it to test out my strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he says so, Benimaru raises his right hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, he gains control of everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has analyzed thoroughly between the capability of Charybdis and himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This battle could now end in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru holds his footing tight and unsheathe his tachi covered in black flame to slash against Charybdis. However, his strength wasn&rsquo;t enough to cut through the Giant body that Charybdis has built so far.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there is one big difference from before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike Alvis&rsquo; attack, its wound did not regenerate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Charybdis has taken the burning damage of &ldquo;Black Flame&rdquo; from the knife and it seems to be burning it to ashes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ze, I&rsquo;m still not good enough it seems. No time to toy with you then, I&rsquo;ll send you straight to hell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru says so as she walks in front of Alvis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With his tachi carried on his shoulder, he isn&rsquo;t even considering Charybdis as a threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My apologies, I was playing to have some fun with you when you complete your body&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It hasn&rsquo;t flown to the sky, yet its gigantic body is almost forty meters long. Yet right now this gigantic being is being covered up by a black hemisphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Begone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru whispers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In an instant&mdash;with a &ldquo;BOOM!&rdquo; sound, its noise spread across the surrounding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s the large area burning attack &mdash;&rdquo;Black Flame Hell&rdquo;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its power cannot be compared to that of the past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition to Benimaru&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fire Manipulation&rdquo;, his magicule movement is completely within his control. Even with Charybdis&rsquo; innate skill &ldquo;Magic Interference&rdquo;, its body is still burnt to ashes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus it shows how much stronger has Benimaru&rsquo;s control of magicule is compared to the Charybdis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis is justified be so surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s attack is able to harm Charybdis, which indicates his magicule possession is superior than it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That means&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru is already able to rival the master of Alvis and her companions, that is Demon Lord Karion, Rank Calamity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alvis, I still have something to do. Right now, I order you to command the army as an adjutant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Understood, Benimaru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis deactivates her &ldquo;Transformation&rdquo; and receives her order while kneeling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She has a lot of questions on her mind, but it is the wrong time to ask. She has hidden her inner shocks to take on the order with pleasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The calamity Charybdis that appeared on this land&mdash;was taken care of before it could destroy a thing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He, hehehe&hellip; What a surprise. I know Yamza would betray, but I can&rsquo;t believe Charybdis was handled that easily but someone&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right. Talk about everything having its own vanquisher, even us won&rsquo;t be able to kill it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Clayman&rsquo;s army has been routed. The mission is a failure and he&rsquo;s suffered heavy losses this time. He should have listened to that lord and stay put as he&rsquo;s ordered.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right. Even Laplace went to persuade him, it&rsquo;s all Clayman&rsquo;s fault this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Footman and Tear exchanges looks and chit chats with each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Phobio, who&rsquo;s been devastated in the fight, is still waiting in front of the two alongside Geld who&rsquo;s come to protect him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to report to that lord now, playtime is over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Footman didn&rsquo;t get a scratch while Tear sustained some injuries that wouldn&rsquo;t have affected combat either way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If in terms of damages they sustained, Geld and Phobio is on the losing side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to escape. I know you guys are good. But I just need stall you until Alvis and Suphia arrive. As well as with Benimaru-san, you guys are dead meat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Phobio raises his body while shaking, announcing these to them. His wounds just now have all been healed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is the level of regenerative power akin to &ldquo;Super Regeneration&rdquo; that can easily outrank the &ldquo;Automatic Regeneration&rdquo; unique to the Beastmen. After all, Phobio was once consumed by Charybdis, he has inherited some of its power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are really annoying, little black kitty!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tear shouts as she sends Phobio flying in a hit. But it was not lethal, and Phobio was able to regenerates and stands back up instantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tear has the upper hand in terms of speed, but she&rsquo;s unable to deliver a fatal blow to Phobio. On the other hand, despite Phobio is covered in wounds, none of which are severe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This duel seems to look as though Phobio has lost, but with each minute passing, there may be a very different result in the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Footman and Geld,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Footman would squeeze himself into a giant meatball and smash towards Geld with high spinning speed. Geld would then fend himself with his giant shield and launch an intense counterattack in between the interval. However, all of these attacks have been stopped by Footman&rsquo;s meat armor and thus not sufficient to cause any lethal wounds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two side continues this cycle of attack and defense, both seem on part with the opponent. That is how their duels are going.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, that is because Footman is not treating it seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just now Charybdis was just defeated, and Footman has lost his interest because of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Woo!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing he has gotten serious; Geld immediately shows up before Phobio to defend him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Geld-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He couldn&rsquo;t answer Phobio&rsquo;s question before Footman attacks towards Geld and him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a Giant Magic Missile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a solid hit that didn&rsquo;t have much change to its shape, yet its power was enough to change the terrain of the surrounding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld&rsquo;s giant shield is destroyed by the missile. Not only so, his full body armors are also broken into pieces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Phobio, even with Geld&rsquo;s shielding sustained some damage. He got to survive thanks to &ldquo;Super Regeneration.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&mdash;Hehehe. Taking care of you guys aren&rsquo;t part of my contract, so I&rsquo;ll let you walk this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Be grateful! You guys would be dead long ago if we got serious!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld and Phobio have sustained heavy injuries that they are unable to stand. These are the words heard by them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the dust of the explosion dissipates, there is no sign of Footman and Tear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;That was a terrible loss. Even though I&rsquo;ve gained new power through it, there is still many that are stronger than me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, had Geld-san not come, I would have long been dead. Sorry, I&rsquo;ve dragged you back&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is no such thing. We&rsquo;ve lost indeed, but we are still alive. Let&rsquo;s just win our next fight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld encourages Phobio like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, you are right!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Phobio is no amateur.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s just that Footman and Tear are too strong. With that power, it won&rsquo;t be strange if people call them Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From magicule possession alone, it would seem that Geld is superior. But the cunningness of the opponents has greatly masked the difference between their skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Geld fought Footman, he has taken a defense stance all along. With that being said, he knew that he won&rsquo;t be able to win even with all he&rsquo;s got put into the fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the result is exactly as he intended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru-san, the clowns have escaped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld reports to Benimaru using &ldquo;Telepathy Net&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, I saw. And they thought they&rsquo;ve had mercy on us, how naive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld received order from Benimaru to find out what the opponents are capable of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition he needed to protect Phobio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">I was just here to observe the situation&mdash;Even though I can&rsquo;t say it was that easy. But it is their biggest failure that they&rsquo;ve not killed me. Benimaru-sama would also keep a record of my fights. In other words, we can give it to Rimuru-sama for analysis. Then their powers and secrets would be exposed to everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is why their defeat was not meaningless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has accomplished his goals. There is no need to worry about winning at the moment, he can always train himself in the future to reduce their gap in strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld wanted to use his own men to fight to the death at this place of destiny, but unfortunately, he is not strong enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">But I will win next time!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He makes such resolve in heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll return to command the army.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go ahead, there is still one more troublesome guy. I&rsquo;ll have him companied.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It ain&rsquo;t easy being a Generalissimo. Geld thinks to himself after the report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are several hidden opponents that are really challenging.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They couldn&rsquo;t fight these individuals simultaneously, so they had to take the harder route in tactic in order to distract and spread these people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the situation now, Benimaru would prioritize the sequence of aiding, but it may put others in danger if his judgements are wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But with that being said, Benimaru has fulfilled his duty perfectly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was planning to go straight for Footman&rsquo;s head, but he&rsquo;s put aside his personal grudge to consider the victory of the whole army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">This Generalissimo doesn&rsquo;t seem so reckless in his decision-making. As compared to our initial battle with each other, he&rsquo;s grown a lot&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld feels much more respect and trust towards Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;The time rewinds a bit and we are again at the end of the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two parties have only fought for a few minutes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This, however, has been like forever to Gabiru and Suphia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this period has suddenly come to an end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hu&mdash;hu&mdash;W-What is&hellip; Is happening&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia has learnt how to buffer herself after being thrown the second and third times, her tired body is also smoothened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, Gabiru is not used to the attack. He has been tricked all over the place and exhausted as he swings around his spear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley has been the two&rsquo;s opponents all this time. He doesn&rsquo;t seem tired at all, rather he looks very energetic. These two are a piece of cake compared to sparring with Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Midley is also the first to notice the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone, I approve you all of using healing magic! Get up! Come on, get everyone up right now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He no longer looks as calm as he shouts out furiously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is bad Midley-sama! From the reaction it seems to be quite the monstrosity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know! That is probably the Charybdis that Milim-sama just defeated recently. No, or is it its remains?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like so&hellip; But it doesn&rsquo;t seem quite stable, even without our interference, it will probably disappear in about a day&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, this is the battlefield. It may have some unforeseen development if we are not cautious. We&rsquo;d better not feed anything to a monster like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley and Hermes who&rsquo;s been suddenly healed have entered their own worlds and converses all over the place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, the priests on the ground begin to cast healing magic, not only on themselves, but also helping to heal Gabiru&rsquo;s subordinates from &ldquo;Hiryuu&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you mean Charybdis? That monster that possessed baka Phobio! Didn&rsquo;t Demon Lord Milim destroy it already?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, Charybdis has already been eliminated by Milim-sama&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia and Gabiru also join the discussion. They don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the right time to be stubborn about winning or losing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calm down everyone. That isn&rsquo;t the real deal, more like the fragments of its power. And it seems to have used Yamza as substitute for its &lsquo;Core&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley activates his &ldquo;Dragon Eye&rdquo; and begins to analyze the nature of the thing to explain to everyone. It is not as effective as Milim&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dragon Eye&rdquo;, but it is still a great skill with the abilities of &ldquo;Vision&rdquo; and &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes is not just sitting around either, he&rsquo;s guarding the surrounding in case of emergency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That should be it. I was planning to kill that bastard Yamza, but his soul has been eaten clean. With how things have developed, all we can do is try to reduce casualty and wait for it to die out by itself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He concludes calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Have you guys heard what I said? I permit everyone to gear up to prepare for battle. But don&rsquo;t get greedy. We are just buying time to come up with a solution against it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let us help as well. We are much more skilled in high speed flying compared to last time. We won&rsquo;t get injured as long as we watch the scale attack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley and Gabiru are like old friends. The two decides to collaborate with much tacit bonds. The mad Charybdis has one habit of chasing things that move. Gabiru&rsquo;s party can fly and is the best bait for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia is also contemplating, her brain is running much faster than usual. She decides to do whatever she can and immediately takes actions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, in order to prevent it from consuming any ground troops, I&rsquo;ll assist everyone to retreat&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she couldn&rsquo;t finish her sentence before things took a quick turn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is when Benimaru happened to incinerate Charybdis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wh&hellip;What&hellip;! That guy didn&rsquo;t even flinch while carrying out such spectacle!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;What the hell? Is that a Demon Lord? It would make sense if it&rsquo;s Milim-sama, but how can a single Majin be capable of that? What a monster&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only two people saw it first-hand, Midley and Hermes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suphia, Gabiru also noticed the difference, but they are aware of the situation. All they knew was that the evil aura of the Charybdis dissipated instantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;OI, what happened? Could you tell me as well!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. I was hoping you two would help explain to us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that, I want to do it as well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But it seems unnecessary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes and Midley couldn&rsquo;t begin to explain before the space before Suphia and Gabiru begin to twist and till. A Majin with red hair, akin to burning fire appears before them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s Benimaru with his tachi on his shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru has come here to deal with the last dangerous individual on the battlefield&mdash;Midley.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, it seems our men have been taken under your care.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru arrives to stare intensely at Midley, but he soon realizes things were amiss. There are traces of fights at the scene, yet there are no injured. The tension that was just about to break out now ceases to exist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a second, Benimaru-sama! These people are Milim-sama&rsquo;s subordinates. The Priest Warrior from the Worshippers of Dragon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, Milim-sama&rsquo;s subordinates? That means&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Our wounds are healed by their healing magic too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip; I see. I suppose I&rsquo;ve thought too much. You&rsquo;ve really raised my alert high since you are the toughest opponent to deal with on this battlefield.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHAHAHAHA, you weren&rsquo;t thinking it wrong. Our troop did fight yours. And it&rsquo;s also true that we&rsquo;ve healed your wounds, but that is for the coming battle against the bigger trouble. Right now there is no longer this necessity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I see. Then what should we do next? Do you wish to fight us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that, what to do now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t actually want to fight Milim-sama&rsquo;s subordinates either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s right. Even though I want to have a spar with you, but it&rsquo;s not to antagonize you. But instead to see who&rsquo;s stronger in terms of strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how it is, I understand your sentiments.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley and Benimaru both smiles as they finish their words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, HOLD ON&mdash;! This isn&rsquo;t appropriate!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, Benimaru-sama! If you harmed Milim-sama&rsquo;s subordinates, there is no guarantee how much hell she would rain on us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Midley-sama! Rimuru-sama and Milim-sama are friends, it would lead to a catastrophe!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hermes and Gabiru moves out to stop the two, while Suphia who was trying to interject has to shut up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know. Besides, if we really get serious in the fight, I&rsquo;ll most likely lose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru decides to step up with the addition of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t plan to fight without the chance to win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHAHAHAHA, nice saying. But if you are able to kill that Charybdis, even someone as strong as me wouldn&rsquo;t be absolutely sure in defending against your attack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Midley follows it up with his laughter, with those words said, he seems confident in preventing Benimaru from using the skills he used to win against Charybdis. It would definitely render the fight into a life-or-death brawl rather than a relaxing spar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be too strange to spar on this battlefield, and besides, the incentive to fight against each other has long gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On top of that, none of the side has the intention of doing the fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that, at this location&mdash;The battle that took place at the ruins of the Orc Kingdom Obic concludes with the overwhelming victory of the united army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from this, there is another battlefield out there, there also&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The time is midnight twelve o&rsquo;clock. Shuna, Souei and Hakurou begin their operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Across the wetland masked by thick fog, there lies the Clayman&rsquo;s headquarter ahead. They intend to go there as they secretly intrude the wetland.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are many suspicious swamps in the wetland with sound of biogas popping off. This biogas seems to be the cause of the fogs, adding a sense of creepiness to its surrounding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as they intrude into the wetland, a thick layer of mist begins to emerge in front their eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is not good. My &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo; has been affected by the fog.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. This is the reason why I&rsquo;ve given up my investigation. My visions here are greatly limited and I could only rely on my five senses to collect intel. On the contrary, the enemies seem to be collecting intelligence using the fog.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how it is, in other words, the situation is highly against us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Hakurou-sama should be fine and I could also use skill &lsquo;Stealth&rsquo; to conceal my presence. However, Shuna-sama would&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Souei said, Hakurou could use his esoteric invisibility technique &ldquo;Haziness&rdquo; to completely hide his presence. Souei can also achieve perfect stealth that causing one unable to detect him even if he&rsquo;s right next to them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna is faced with the biggest challenge, but Souei&rsquo;s concerns seem to be unwarranted. Shuna also erases her traces and conceals her perfectly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, so it works just like my &lsquo;Haziness&rsquo;. It seems to be a combined skill of &lsquo;Illusion Magic&rsquo; and &lsquo;Witchery&rsquo;. As expected of Shuna-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou is correct, that is the unique skill invented by Shuna. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although unable to rival Rimuru, Shuna can create unique magic through her unique skill &ldquo;Creator&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It seems that the issue has been resolved. But do still be cautious, as you can&rsquo;t use &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; as long as you remain in the sea of fog. The vision is not clear, and communication is difficult, so you guys must be careful with every step you take</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class="c1">. Also, here&rsquo;s something for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this sea of fog, even with Souei&rsquo;s &ldquo;Clone&rdquo; to connect the them, they can&rsquo;t communicate through &ldquo;Telepathy Net&rdquo;. So Souei wants Hakurou and Shuna to hold on to &ldquo;Sticky Steel Web&rdquo; as method of emergency contact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Through the vibration of the web, they can make some bare communication with each other. However, once the web is broken, they will lose the method to contact, so they must be cautious with its usage. Shuna and Hakurou nod and carefully wrap the web around their wrists.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That concludes the preparation work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s head out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna launches the journey as the three begin to move out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;This is bad, we seem to have walked into a trap.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With only a few minutes set out, Shuna stops to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A trap?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also getting a mixed feel from the surrounding, almost as if there are presences of enemies&mdash;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei couldn&rsquo;t finish his sentence when he senses an unknown and overwhelming aura suddenly surrounds him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe this&hellip; They&rsquo;ve got many people, how could I have not sensed it, where have they been hiding?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, Hakurou! The enemies have not shown, but we have been lured to this location!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so, it must be this fog. Not only did this fog caused us to lose direction, it also hid our enemies&rsquo; presence and lured us into the center of this encirclement of trap&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that is how it was, this is the reason why I&rsquo;ve been feeling strange from the start.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, Souei, Hakurou. This fog has triggered &lsquo;Dimensional Interference&rsquo;. No matter where the enemies attack us from, it will always lead them back to a certain location&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Halfway through Shuna&rsquo;s explanation, someone has already rushed out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei and Hakurou are maintaining their guards against the concealed monsters near their surrounding and at the same time, displays a battle posture against the person that suddenly appeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna also remains silent as she looks at the person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A skeleton wearing white clergy coat&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is the person who appeared before Shuna&rsquo;s party.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Such strong mana&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna whispers with cold sweat on her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She thought and panicked for a moment thinking that it was Clayman himself, but he quickly rejected that idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s already past midnight twelve o&rsquo;clock, Clayman has long set out for the Walpurgis Banquet. If that&rsquo;s the case, the logical deduction would be that this is one of the members of Clayman&rsquo;s close lieutenants, a member of the &ldquo;Five Fingers&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now this individual not only can rival the strength of the Beastketeers, his power is closing in on that of Demon Lord. That is how much magicules this Majin possesses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s also unbelievable to Shuna is why such a person would want to work under others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Shuna then recalls a thing that Myuran mentioned to her. The member of Clayman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Five Fingers&rdquo; who is responsible for defending the castle is&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I see, you must be Adalman. The ruler of this land&mdash;The Undead King who leads many undead monsters.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hakurou, through his &ldquo;Eyes of Heaven&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;also reached the same conclusion just as Shuna described.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman&rsquo;s immense and ominous power is far greater than what Myuran described. This is the Undead King who can rival a Demon Lord, he is the protector of this land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei wouldn&rsquo;t doubt Shuna and Hakurou&rsquo;s, reaching the intended conclusion as it is meant to be reached. He concentrates his killing intent quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whoever this foe is, I&rsquo;ll kill him&mdash;That&rsquo;s the logic of Souei&rsquo;s action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, Souei prepares for action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, I am Adalman. Guardian of this land and servant to the order of the great Demon Lord Clayman-sama. Lowly intruders, prepare to die. If you follow my order, I shall grant you all a painless death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Undead King&mdash;Adalman proclaims.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is an order from a king. Those words indicate that he is not considering enemies such as Shuna as an equal to him. But it is reasonable to be terrified at the high possession of magicules Adalman holds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem that due to the presence of his seemingly infinite magicules, tens of thousands of undead monsters begin to emerge from the surrounding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Godagodagodagoda, giligiligiligili *spooky skeleton sounds* they begin to make sharp noises as they surround Shuna&rsquo;s party.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s true, we&rsquo;ve been completely surrounded by the enemies. This fog is combined with &lsquo;Coordination Barrier&rsquo;, we can&rsquo;t use &lsquo;Dimensional Transportation&rsquo; to escape. All means of communication have been interfered, we can only break out of the encirclement by defeating Adalman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna informs them without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Basically, Hakurou and Souei would never just take Adalman&rsquo;s suggestion without a fight. Hearing Shuna&rsquo;s suggestion, the two strike out together without a discussion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No time to waste, let&rsquo;s take down the enemy general.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree. One it is struck by my techniques, even the dead can&rsquo;t escape their fate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two make such response as they close in on Adalman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing the two striking towards him, Adalman gives off a disdaining smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, a bunch of arrogant fools. How silly of me to have wished to offer you my mercy. Since you won&rsquo;t even be grateful to my proposition, I shall let you taste the consequences and regret your decision.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman swings his giant hand as if he still has much strength to spare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Immediately afterward, something astounding occurs. Hakurou&rsquo;s knife closing in on the enemy was stopped by a knight in front of Adalman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou deeply believed that that strike would have taken his enemy&rsquo;s life. He backs off while being shocked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That knight is a Rank A- monster, Undead Knight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, that strike has had Hakurou discovered something amiss. Even if it&rsquo;s a powerful monster, a single Undead Knight won&rsquo;t be able to stop Hakurou&rsquo;s knife.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are no common foe. Very well, I shall use my real skills to spar with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou was right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has realized the strength of this Undead Knight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is not skills derived from the bodily strength of monster, but from human skills gained through the hardship of training.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, it won&rsquo;t be the simple type to be seen through by &ldquo;Eyes of Heaven&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s why Hakurou has devoted himself to duel his Undead Knight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Undead Knight remains silent. He can&rsquo;t talk with hie temporary body made up of dead corpse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, you can see the blue white flame shaking in its hollow eye sacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is undoubtedly the light of will. They symbolize he has accepted Hakurou&rsquo;s invitation to duel in the name of honor as a human.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though he is no longer a human, the heart of that Undead Knight still belongs to an honorable knight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both sides have rivaling magicule stores as well as similar bodily strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With sparks from the clashes of techniques trained for years, the battle between two master swordsmen begin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from that, Souei has also encountered an opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was sneaking near Adalman before a giant shadow emerged before him to stop his attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ze!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei smacks his lip while staring at the gigantic shadow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Could this be a Zombie Dragon</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span class="c1">&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, Souei! The enemy is not that simple! His magicule level alone is greater than you. It would be the strongest undead monster here&mdash;Undead Dragon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fog has blocked Shuna&rsquo;s vision making her hard to do an accurate analysis of the enemies&rsquo; real identities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After hearing so, Souei gives off an upset look. He could handle it if he&rsquo;s on his own, but right now the situation is highly disadvantageous as he is also trying to protect Shuna during his fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The more dependable Hakurou is focusing on fighting the Undead Knight as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei must defeat the Undead Dragon as soon as possible. If not the tens of thousands of undead monsters from all around would devour them all, even Shuna would not be able to survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Souei&rsquo;s point of view, he doesn&rsquo;t need to hold back under such circumstances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Time to die! Web slash of ten thousand monsters</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span class="c1">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He decides on the spot to give off all he has to attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His unique skill &ldquo;Secret Inspector&rdquo; grants him the effect of &ldquo;One Hit Kill&rdquo; by using tens of thousands of &ldquo;Viscous Steel Web&rdquo; to chop his enemies into pieces&mdash;This is the ultimate killing move of Souei, like looking through sceneries of a kaleidoscope, where the flowers of fresh blood blooms. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It won&rsquo;t matter even if the enemies are half spiritual life form such as undead. His technique can cut through and kill spiritual beings, so it should be the case that they are already dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How could this be, it is regenerating!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei begins to feel anxious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The twenty-something feet tall giant body has now been chopped into chunks, so his victory should have been guaranteed. Yet, the Undead Dragon revived itself as if it was nothing and restored its body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s even faster than &ldquo;Super Regeneration&rdquo;, the power of so called &ldquo;Undead&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll destroy you along with your soul&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei makes up his resolve, yet Shuna&rsquo;s calm voice raises beside him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calm down, Souei. Some as calm and analytic as you should know that you can&rsquo;t defeat the Undead Dragon, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And the soul of that dragon seems to be in the body of that Majin Adalman. Don&rsquo;t worry about me, just focus on distracting the dragon. I&rsquo;ll take down Adalman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna says so calmly to Souei.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is too dangerous!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, Souei. Right now I am angry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A cold smile hangs on Shuna&rsquo;s face as she expresses her dismissal of Souei&rsquo;s concern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes begin to glow brighter, showing her aggressive side. Seeing this, Souei lost his words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shuna was once the female Miko responsible to rectify the Ogre tribes. Her words held a certain power that can cause others to follow her every order. Right now, her power has long surpassed the unique skill &ldquo;Kyogenshi&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;(Speaker of mad words) of &ldquo;Otherworlder&rdquo; Kirara Mizutani. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, Shuna is not the type of person who needs protection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei is well aware of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then there could only be one answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood. I wish you emerge victorious, Shuna-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The same goes for you, Souei. The dragon is all yours.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna smiles as she says so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei nods towards her and returns his focus on the Undead Dragon. Since he&rsquo;s taken the task, he won&rsquo;t hesitate anyone. Souei is confident in Shuna and dives into his own battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna is alone now, but she&rsquo;s not anxious nor panicked as she confronts Adalman directly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman seems to look down on her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? What do you plan to do, young lady? What can you do without your guards? And how do you plan to take on this ten-thousand strong troop?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman&rsquo;s voice reflects a level of unbelieving accompanied by a sense of joy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, Adalman is enjoying himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The order of Demon Lord Clayman cannot be disobeyed, but Adelman&#39;s own will still remains, only his actions are restrained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eliminating invaders&mdash;That&rsquo;s the only thing Adalman can do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All powerful but with an empty head&mdash;That&rsquo;s how Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates always mock him. This is only so because Adalman has been bonded by the land and unable to move freely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman won&rsquo;t even give him a chance to argue back, it&rsquo;s no wonder why everyone does not know about this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not accurate to call Adalman a Majin, he is more akin to a weapon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is the defense mechanism bonded to this land to protect the castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His soul however is not restrained, but his actions are all scripted orders that would automatically be executed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he claims to pledge his loyalty to Clayman, but it&rsquo;s all but an act. This mechanism has long been designed to express respect towards its master. And Adalman has long desired to get rid out of such chain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why Adalman is enjoying his time talking to Shuna.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would always automatically carry out the mission to protect the castle regardless of the situation. However, Adalman is not restrained from talking to the invaders, which is one of his sources of joy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is perhaps a twisted form of mercy from the craftsman of this mechanism&mdash;Demon Lord Kazaream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps that is not the truth, however, Adalman has decided to explain it in that direction. After all, with this tip bit of mercy, Adalman was able to remain sane and endure for thousands of years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">I do appreciate him for crafting this mechanism in order to prolong its durability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman believes so deep down his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is for this reason he is able to give everything he has to defeat the invaders when he&rsquo;s body is no longer retrained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon imagining the scene of more than ten thousand undead monsters plunging at Shuna, he prays to himself that she won&rsquo;t suffer too much pain in her death&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about that. &lsquo;Anti-Monster-Attribute Barrier&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna&rsquo;s firm voice echoes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that instant, the circle with one-hundred-feet long radius centered around Shuna suddenly becomes a holy ground that would prevent the invasion of any evil monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a barrier that will respond to magicule matters. She &ldquo;Analyze&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fuse&rdquo; her &ldquo;Magic Nullified Domain&rdquo; and &ldquo;Holy Purification Barrier&rdquo;. With previous experience of their usage, Shuna developed this original spell by herself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time he has barricaded against all magicule. It also has very powerful Magical defense that could choose one of the four elements such as fire and wind to defend against.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, we won&rsquo;t have any other people to interfere. If I can beat you, I would be able to destroy the defense mechanism that is using you as its core.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Oh, impressive. You&rsquo;ve discovered my secret. Little girl, what is your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, just as what Shuna said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once Adalman is eliminated, the defense mechanics of the castle would also be destroyed. The key point of the mechanics lies on the fact that Adalman&rsquo;s soul has been bonded to the terrain, which has enabled the perpetuation of powerful magicule energy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, then the Undead Dragon who admires Adalman, his close ally and friend Undead Knight would also be able to break free from this cursed bond.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna has seen through the truth in one glance and Adalman is impressed from the bottom of his heart. He also holds a shred of hope that his opponent may be able to assist them in escaping their suffering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My name is Shuna.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shuna, Shuna-san then. Let&rsquo;s have our battle. If you could beat me, I shall respect your will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite the generous offer. However, we only want to destroy Demon Lord Clayman. If you stay out of my way, I can spare you your life. You can also continue to stick around here if you want!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heheh, but shouldn&rsquo;t you know that is simply impossible?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? By the magnitude of your strength, you should be able to win against that cursed bond by yourself, but I may have been mistaken. It can&rsquo;t be helped then. I&rsquo;ll go according to the plan to defeat you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna says so without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">If I could conquer this cursed bond, I would have done so long ago. Demon Lord Kazaream is a horrifying man who few could stand against him. HIs title &ldquo;Curse King&rdquo; did not come in vain. Yet you describe it like such an easy chore&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is how Adalman sees it, but even so, his mood did not get worse,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then this would be the end of our conversation. Now, fight with everything you&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle ignites.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman was once a prince. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His hometown was one of the many province states under the rule of Holy Empire Ruberios.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These countries had no army. They relied on the Templar Knight Order sent out by the central Saints Church to protect their lands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was at the cost of having to uphold the Ruminas sect as their national religion and supply the knight order with both talented labor and monetary fund.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the time, the Western Saints Church were not as influential as it is now, and the Holy Knight Order has yet to be formed. The ones excelled in the field would be rewarded the honorable knight title of the Templar Knight. It was a title that cannot be passed on in generation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under such circumstance at the time, Adalman was one of these talented individuals that was elected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His brother inherited the throne and gave birth to the new heir. Due to such condition, Adalman became more diligent in promoting the Ruminas sect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He started his new career by joining the Western Saints Church that promote Ruminas sect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman was charmed by the deity and believed Ruminas with all his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ruminas is the great god, and Adalman never once held doubt against his god.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why he obtained the archbishop skill &ldquo;Miracle&rdquo; and became one of the few masters of &ldquo;Holy Magic&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was able to climb to the highest position within the Western Saint Church and became a Cardinal Deacon, yet his position within the Holy Empire Ruberios was still not very high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman continued to work even harder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to get to a higher place of power, he didn&rsquo;t limit himself to &ldquo;Holy Magic&rdquo;, he even began to learn other magics. He often discussed, practiced magic with his friend then, Gedora (D: Remember this name, he&rsquo;d be back in 6 volumes kek), in hopes of becoming stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His hard work was finally rewarded, as Adalman was able to become a &ldquo;Sage&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sage refers to the spiritual life form that pushes human body to a similar state as the astral body of a greater spirit. These people are seen as humanity&rsquo;s guardian with much greater strength than ordinary humans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With this power in hand, Adalman was able to move up the ladder of power to assume the role of Cardinal Priest.</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt38" id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Time passed by fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman devoted himself into studying magic and was one more step before reaching peak human performance and becoming &ldquo;Saint&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet Adalman encountered a joyful surprise then. Someone finally summoned him to the &ldquo;Inner sanctum&rdquo; on the Spirit Mountain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was really happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Now I can finally meet Ruminas-sama!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, Adalman really did believe in the existence of the god Ruminas. After all, it is reasonable for him to think so given such fantasy is part of his faith.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the beginning of the end. The uninformed Adalman headed towards the Holy Land with great joy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet unknowing to him, his ardent heart had been betrayed&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The intense magical battle entered a stalemate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Melt them down, corrode all matters&mdash;Corrosive Acid Magic Missile!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman chant and cast elemental-based magic &ldquo;Corrosive Acid Magic Missile&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many water balls begin to flow in midair and pour towards them the magic missiles that could corrode even bones. These water balls begin to shoot out Magic Acid Missiles at Shuna like a storm of rain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet Shuna does not seem panic at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Magic Flame Wall.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The flame wall stopped all of the acid missiles and evaporated them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her thinking speed has been accelerated to a thousand times more alongside his highly accurate &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo;, and she is also capable of alter reality using her &ldquo;Casting Rejection&rdquo; and &ldquo;Law Manipulation&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very good, but how about this one! Oh cursed spirits, I grant thee thy live sacrifice&mdash;Cursed Bond!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Undead magic&mdash;A branch of spiritual magic, utilizes negative emotions of Demons and the Dead to activate. Among these magic, Cursed Bond is the most wicked. The magic would summon the dead to possess onto human, magic or any living beings to absorb their vitality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this didn&rsquo;t work either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Holy Blessing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman heard Shuna&rsquo;s calm voice, and immediately after, he heard the familiar ring of the holy bell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It alone could purify and grant salvation to the cursed dead.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 610.50px; height: 869.78px;"><img alt="" src="images/image11.png" style="width: 610.50px; height: 869.78px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Impossible! What is this, how can a monster use &ldquo;Holy Magic&rdquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman&rsquo;s eyes are open wide as he witnessed this miracle. The beautiful way Shuna displays when casting reminds Adalman of his hard-working self as a youth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, these Holy Magics are casted by a monster girl. He&rsquo;s shocked to the point of shouting out his thoughts in front of such incredibly unbelievable reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna instead laughs in response. She is not obligated to answer, yet she still gives a detailed explanation to Adalman&rsquo;s doubt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that really strange? You are too rigid in your thinking. &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo; is not a magic unique to humans. If you heart pray for the miracle with enough faith, it will become a reality!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most people believe that in order cast &ldquo;Holy Magic&rdquo; one must bond with the holy spirit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such view is correct in some level, but when viewed on a different spectrum, it would no longer be the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some Majins can use healing magic too&mdash;This means apart from bonding with holy spirit, one has other channels to access &ldquo;Holy Magic&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet most humans and monsters don&rsquo;t know about this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The power of faith&mdash;in truth is the heart to believe in miracle is the key to learning &ldquo;Holy Magic&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter the character of the wielder, one&rsquo;s firm faith would be transferred into power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is the secret truth behind this magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, the Worshipers of Dragon could use &ldquo;Holy Magic&rdquo; because of their faith in Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna explains calmly and told him everything she knew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman is shocked upon hearing this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">I&mdash;have I been mistaken? I&rsquo;ve been betrayed into losing faith in the god Ruminas. That&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t use &ldquo;Holy Magic&rdquo;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;anymore&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman was betrayed by Ruminas. To be more precise, he was played by the higher-ups of the Ruminas sect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He never knew the reason, not even until now. Perhaps they did it in fear of Adalman would climb to a position too high or based on some other reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the one thing he was sure is that the god Ruminas did not give him a helping hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">It&rsquo;s quite funny when I think about it. I was deceived by the &ldquo;Seven Celestial Saints&rdquo; to contaminate the massive wave of undead causing calamity for the people&hellip; And it turned out to be a trap. I accepted Gedora&rsquo;s magic experiment then to have been revived in this twisted form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not knowing the other side intends to push him to the abyss of death, Adalman went to the edge of Great Jura Forest without any concern, the location where he resides today. There, massive number of undead monsters and their Zombie Dragon leader awaited Adalman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman&rsquo;s close ally and friend&mdash;Holy Templar Knight Albert fought with him alongside four other knights and an expedition army who all admired Adalman. Yet in the end they exhausted themselves in battle and died on this land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman died once. But at the time, his other friend Gedora casted the secret technique of &ldquo;Reincarnation&rdquo; on him to successfully revive him. However, the foul spirits of the land corrupted him, and the curse of the dead bonded him. The reincarnated Adalman did not turn into human, instead he became an undead that looks like a skeleton.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demon Lord Kazaream saw the talent of Adalman the undead, which is why he fell to where he is today.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is why I believe you are not my opponent as long as you can&rsquo;t use &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna asserts herself with these words, Adalman thus realizes he&rsquo;s still in midst of battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-how? How do you know I can use &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman asks Shuna out of curiosity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Shuna responded coldly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because the way you look. You wear white holy rope that only a high position priest could wear. You are a high-level mage qualified to wear it, yet you aren&rsquo;t even able to break this level of cursed bonds. Instead you complain it to your safe and act so soft of a man. You only wear this outfit out of your nostalgia for &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t need to be cautious against opponent like you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words were filled with disdain as if saying &ldquo;Why do you still act all high and mighty at this point.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Ehh&hellip; How dare you say this nonsense when I remain silent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman becomes furious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, he&rsquo;s not angry at Shuna but himself. His fury originates from his shock that someone suddenly pointed out his real thoughts that reflected how useless he has been.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, his dismay that lasted for thousands of years have finally been cleared up. He feels much joy and smooth within his body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I pray to lord thy god. Grant me thy holy power and listen to my wishes&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the outburst of emotion, Adalman begins to chant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Indeed. It is because my resolve is not thorough enough. My companions who admire me were turned into undead monsters and I couldn&rsquo;t just leave them behind&hellip; It was I who was naive. &rdquo;Undead Magic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Elemental-based Magic&rdquo; couldn&rsquo;t purify undead monsters. But if I continue to pray in hope of casting &ldquo;Holy Magic&rdquo;, it may actually&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If anything, the reason why Adalman was trapped and bonded by this land was due to his companions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They died on this land and became the cursed dead. Adalman couldn&rsquo;t let him behind. This thought alone has bonded him with this terrain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now Adalman finally realizes how wrong he was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He raises his two skeleton hands and draws out complicated spell patterns while reciting prayer to god.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are curse spells, the proof being the complicated geometric shapes that emerged before Adalman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Shuna, right? I don&rsquo;t hate you. Moreover, you&rsquo;ve helped me to clear up my mind. I very much appreciate that. However, I can&rsquo;t just commit suicide. So I&rsquo;m sorry that you&rsquo;ll have to come along with me to death&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman apologizes to Shuna in his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are still many levels of highly imposing forces of Demon Lord Kazaream that bonds Adalman. That&rsquo;s why even suicide is not allowed. But with that being said, it&rsquo;s a different case to be killed by the remaining shock wave of the attack launched at the enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He plans to kill Shuna as well as himself. In this way, his companions that have been affected by him could finally be set free&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As of now, many layers of magical circles gradually unfold around Shuna and Adalman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I call forth the destruction of all beings! &lsquo;Disintegration&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was waiting for that! &lsquo;Overdrive&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as Adalman cast his spell, Shuna utilized her unique skill &ldquo;Analyzer&rdquo; to carry out &ldquo;Law Manipulation&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It resulted in the spirit particles gathered by Adalman to no longer be in his grasp and begins to go out of control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-What? Your magicule possession is less than one tenth of me, yet you could overwrite my magic&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Magicule and Spiritual particles all operate based on magic. In terms of overdrive magic, there is no other explanation but that Shuna&rsquo;s magic ability is above that of Adalman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Adalman&rsquo;s view, Shuna has not been a worthy opponent at all. Now he realizes again that he has misjudged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very impressive. To reward you, I shall severe you cursed bond with this land!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna didn&rsquo;t listen to him till the end as overflowing light begins to consume Adalman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna has exploited Adalman&rsquo;s magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When confronted with Adalman who is a competent user of Holy Magic than her, he holds sufficient power to purify this entire land. Shuna didn&rsquo;t expect him to release the most powerful Holy Magic spell, but thankfully she knew the origin of that magic and overwrite it with ease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On this land, where that shine of light is omnipresent, it consumed all undead monsters including Adalman and purifies them&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou and Souei come before Shuna.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh well, I was trying to get a result early, but that Undead Knight is surprisingly skillful. Shuna-sama has saved my life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman was defeated and the land was purified. The Undead Knight devolved to a skeleton swordsman and was rendered incapable of moving. It would seem that the Undead Knight is under the order of Adalman to cease combating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon seeing his look, Hakurou knew that his duel has concluded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is a shame that he wasn&rsquo;t able to come to a result against an opponent, long awaited by him, who would require Hakurou to fight with his real abilities. But right now protecting Shuna is the more important thing. Hakurou knew the priority of things and immediately went back before Shuna.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m lucky that Hakurou is here. If it&rsquo;s me, I won&rsquo;t be able to defeat the Undead Knight. Souei as well, your opponent was an Undead Dragon yet you were able to win some time. Had that dragon been causing rampaged all over the place, we would not have been able to win this battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t strike it down. I am deeply ashamed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as Souei said, the Undead Dragon was a strong enemy. Its wounds would recover immediately if they are not deep enough. Once you come in contact with its Youki, your mind would also be contaminated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei was only able to retreat with several &ldquo;Clones&rdquo; operated at the same time. He should be praised however that he was able to stall the Undead Dragon that he has no way of beating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That Undead Dragon was also defeated after Adalman&rsquo;s fall. It maintained its shape through Adalman&rsquo;s magicule and was no longer able to maintain its body afterward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei personally couldn&rsquo;t accept the result, but surviving alone is a victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the being said&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three look at each other awkwardly and sigh together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speaking of which, if that Adalman fought us seriously from the start, we would have been killed. I was so mad that I may have overdone things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, Adalman didn&rsquo;t intentionally hold back or play any dirty tricks. If he truly intended to Kill Shuna and the rest, there must be other available methods.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna saw through it and began he self-reflection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, we may have become boastful after gaining power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s worries were warranted as he said that the situation of the battlefield may alter in an instant. I should have collected more intelligences.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three speak up and reflect for their arrogance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But regardless, they were able to triumph.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman&rsquo;s headquarter has lost its key defending members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But things are not done yet. Shuna and the rest still have work to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They must take down Clayman&rsquo;s castle and completely paralyze it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The majority of people remaining in the castle are non-combatants who aren&rsquo;t loyal to Clayman. These are sensible people who were hired by money and they don&rsquo;t intend to resist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rest are mainly forced into bonds with Clayman due to all sorts of reasons. Shuna not only persuaded them, she also helped to release them for their curses. Only a while later were they able to take over the castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Majins within the castle no longer posts a threat, Shuna&rsquo;s party then begin to explore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They&rsquo;ve confirmed that Demon Lord Karion was not detained here. But the rest still wish to find evidence to get their hands on Clayman&rsquo;s weakness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As they are halfway through&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna and the rest were exploring around as someone approaches to speak with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;please hold your step.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? How is he still alive? Should we finish him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold up, Hakurou. This person no longer wishes to fight us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The one came to talk was Adalman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou, who doesn&rsquo;t dare to let down his guard was unsheathing his knife as Shuna stopped him calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shuna-sama&mdash;Please allow us to call you so. Thanks to your magic, we were able to leave this land, receive purification and survive. I believe this is fate in working, so we have one request to as of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a skeleton swordsman, Adalman, now an undead who has lost more than half of his power and kneeled and says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna asks out of suspicion. It seems they have run into trouble again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, much appreciated. In fact I want to see the one who Shuna-sama has place her faith in. I&rsquo;ve lost my faith and my power will never reverse back to that of my prime. I no longer believe in the god Ruminas. That&rsquo;s why I now look for a new god to server.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna and the rest were shocked and speechless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sh-should I call him god? I respect Rimuru-sama, but not to the point of serving as a god!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna makes her bare response, but Adalman doesn&rsquo;t mind. It won&rsquo;t pose a problem to him, so he continues to recommend himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;His name is Rimuru-sama, is it? What a splendid name, perfect for my new god. We may be fragile Undead monsters, but we&rsquo;ll still be of use in some way. Shuna-sama, could you introduce and recommend us to Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unconditional, undoubting faith seems very different from respect for someone&mdash;Shuna was going to explain towards that end but gave up the thought seeing it may turn too troublesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">It&rsquo;s alright. When he sees Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s true identity, he may quit at the sight of the challenge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon recalling how Rimuru&rsquo;s cute and soft look he usually displays, Shuna comes to that conclusion and decides to let things flow as it goes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman also seems very stubborn about his opinion. So persuading him would take too much time, it&rsquo;d be better to just let him do what he wants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, Adalman and the thousands of survivors that are the undead monsters under his rule&mdash;If anything, have all been dead&mdash;are now under Shuman&rsquo;s command. The conquering of Clayman&rsquo;s castle thus concludes here.</span></p><a id="id.44sinio"></a><h2 class="c15" id="h.2jxsxqh"><span class="c6 c2">Chapter 5</span></h2><p class="c19"><span class="c24 c2 c7">Walpurgis Banquet</span></p><hr><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is a luxurious door in front of us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once through, we arrive at the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is a huge roundtable in there with twelve chairs spaced out with equal intervals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is a total of ten Demon Lords with only Karion missing at the moment. That means there will be two more chairs even if I take one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misery leads me to my seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that we will be seated according to the chronological order of becoming a Demon Lord. So I will sit on the furthest side, namely the back seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I make no objection and decide to check out my surroundings as it is a rare opportunity for me to observe all the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of which, there are only two people present at the moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of which is Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She appears to have the most seniority and gets to sit in the top seat. She has been swinging her feet happily for some time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s no different from a kid, so I&rsquo;ll ignore her for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From my point of view, on Ramiris&rsquo; right sits a seductive red-haired man who is on the opposite side of me&mdash;He is indeed a man, yet, his appearance is eerily charming. The handsome specimen just sits there casually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both of his eyes are closed but he probably isn&rsquo;t asleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can easily tell that this guy is far from simple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I activate &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo; yet his stats don&rsquo;t seem to be out of place. But my instinct tells me that this person is abnormal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has similar magicule count as Karion, just on a different wavelength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, you could mistake him to really be green and can&rsquo;t even know control his aura with that amount of magicules.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he can&rsquo;t fool my eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess, if it is the analysis skill of &ldquo;Great Sage&rdquo; that is put into this situation would probably be deceived all over the place. That is how he has cleverly disguised his information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is misleading opponents to misjudge his strength by showing them false information. This is a contest even before the actual fight breaks out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that I recall, I&rsquo;ve got a mind-reading skill just like Dwarf King Gazel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My &ldquo;Great Sage&rdquo; is probably just like those skills, that other people would not be able to know its true capability without I actively lay out my cards and inform them of the skill. It would be a different case if the opponent has &ldquo;Mind Reading&rdquo; ability that can read one&rsquo;s deep subconscious. One would probably only come to the realization of such skill after being manipulated and exploited. But unless one fails to resist, it shouldn&rsquo;t have an effect at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why it is important to conceal skills at times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may act as a bluff when the opponents learn about your skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you really have it yet intentionally try to hide it, it will raise people&rsquo;s suspicion anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what this handsome (beautiful) man is doing right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has deceived others&rsquo; &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo; to raises their suspicion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I personally believe there is a necessity to hide my power. That means to completely suppress my aura in order to prevent giving any information to the enemies, I think that would be the meaningful move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the contrary, what this guy is doing, he can instead read the analyzer&rsquo;s power. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To filter his opponents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, he would see if the opponent has the ability to extract intel. To put aside those incapable of the skill, once he encounters someone who is capable of doing so, he can observe the opponents&rsquo; reaction just like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the opponent would even fear of his illusive disguise, he won&rsquo;t even put the opponent on his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he encounters someone who realizes he is faking, he will send the message that his power is so immeasurable that his opponents won&rsquo;t dare antagonize him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And putting that aside for a moment, even with the false message he sends out, he displays a similar magicule possession as Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His real power is completely incalculable. Since now I understand what he&rsquo;s playing, I&rsquo;d better stay away from any trouble with him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person clearly on a different level with me&mdash;The man known as &ldquo;Guy&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soon after my observation of Guy, another powerful man walks into the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is alone without any company.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His presence by itself is imposing enough. That man must be the Demon Lord Dagruel the Titan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He takes the seat one chair next to the right of Guy without hesitation, lowering down to his seat with much majesty. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, does that empty seat (in between) belong to Milim? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I look towards Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although Guy is already very tall himself, Dagruel somehow seems even much bigger than him. Unexpectedly, his luxurious chair is able to adjust according to the man&rsquo;s size and is able to fit for Dagruel. It would seem everything in this room is some type of extravagant magical device.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This Demon Lord was once the archrival of Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His imposing looks are truly impressive, enough to admit that he is a worthy opponent of a &ldquo;True Dragon&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of this Demon Lord Dagruel, his magicule level is through the roof.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s unknown when comparing him to Veldora, that who would have the edge in terms of strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can tell he has almost immeasurable amount of magicules, but I won&rsquo;t be able to give it an accurate reading unless seeing him in combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, quality is more important than quantity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No need to get so scared just because he has a bit more magicules.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s more important when it comes to how you utilize your strength most effectively. Combat depends on the quality of one&rsquo;s skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This Demon Lord Dagruel seems quite skillful, so I should be on guard with him anyhow&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After observing Dagruel, another Demon Lord shows up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a handsome, fit man in sumptuous clothes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he&rsquo;s not as tall as Dagruel, he&rsquo;s still above average. His facial features are stern and delicate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His short curly blonde hair has a wild quality to it that reflects his energetic and aggressive personality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To make a more straightforward metaphor, this man with his dazzling appearance looks a bit like a movie star.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Somehow, I get the impression that he must be good at charming people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two fangs sticking out of his mouth are most eye-catching.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He must be a Vampire&mdash;meaning, this man is the Demon Lord Valentine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Valentine sits down on Ramiris&rsquo; left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judging by the sequencing seats, this Demon Lord probably has the same level of seniority as Dagruel, both being ancient Demon Lords. It is said that the Vampire Demon Lord has been replaced before, it may just be that he has taken the place of his predecessor after that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never mind, there&rsquo;s no use keeping my mind on the order of seats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Compared to that, something else has caught my eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is Valentine&rsquo;s servants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first one looks like an elderly male butler.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He must be some sort of master as he is not making a single movement like a statue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has a similar logic to me as to surpass all of his Youki in order to prevent being revealed of his true strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second one is even more interesting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A very attractive and beautiful young girl with shining long silver hair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her skin is pure and shining while her gold-silver pupils give off a devilish glow of blue and red. She has a kind of seductive beauty, as if she&rsquo;s halted her growth the very moment, she was transiting from a girl to a woman has immortalized it forever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wears a dress similar to a maid outfit. Maids are all combat classes&mdash;By that theory, it quite likely that the girl is very strong&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m surprised that such powerful individuals are merely subordinates to another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another point worth mentioning is that this beautiful girl&rsquo;s Youki is so immense that it is almost spilling out, which she&rsquo;s actively allowing it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm, wait a second?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I cross eyes with that girl, something feels strange, yet I can&rsquo;t describe it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps I am worrying too much, considering that the Youki leaking from her just randomly changes attributes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo; result as following, Target&rsquo;s magicule storage is much higher than Demon Lord Valentine.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, of course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have no way to assess the total magicules of this girl, but only know that she&rsquo;s got more than her master Demon Lord Valentine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her method of concealment is extremely clever and people unlike me, who don&rsquo;t have an ultimate skill would not be able to see through.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with that being said, she has no intention of hiding it as well. Like Guy, she probably wants to see whether the rest would notice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;If that&rsquo;s the case, could this girl be the Demon Lord herself?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s possible that she is the retired ex-Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her true identity would be the female vampire &ldquo;Milus&rdquo; that even Veldora recognizes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is rumored that the last change in leadership was one thousand, five hundred years ago and the Demon Lords who know the details are less than a few. Did they acquiesce the act or did they really not notice?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or perhaps&mdash;They may simply be uninterested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve got to be cautious with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The current Demon Lord Valentine is no weakling either. His power is unquestionable, given how his Haki feels even stronger than an untransformed Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s also accompanied by the seductive and beautiful maid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she is the Demon Lord whose kingdom was burnt to ashes, she has good reason to hate Veldora. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why in the world would you go provoke this type of people! I want to shout out but hold back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Could this be the legendary syndrome of &ldquo;My head hurts already and it&rsquo;s getting intensified </span><span class="c2 c36">send help</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I am to seek salvation in mind, should I perhaps think in line of &ldquo;My life is complete by enraging and getting killed by this type of beauty&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;No, I don&rsquo;t want that type of salvation after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hope my relationship with Veldora won&rsquo;t get exposed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it does happen to be exposed, I hope I won&rsquo;t be cleaning up his mess (D: &ldquo;wiping his ass&rdquo; is the original sentence) for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I pray to myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterward, some time has passed since I got into this situation before the fifth person enters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He enters alone with drowsy, sleepy eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are two swords sheathed at his belt and that&rsquo;s all his equipment. How convenient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, he opens his eyes to momentarily reveal their beautiful light blue color. His dark purple hair looks dark in the room, with silver strands mixed within.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looks rather young, almost like a high school student. He is quite handsome, but his sleepy eyes and lazy gestures reduce the appeal of his pretty face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That guy wanders towards Ramiris and stops to greet her with his hand slightly raised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Morning&mdash;you are still tiny as ever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you want to pick a fight? How cocky have you got, Dino the noob?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fifth one is Dino. I recall him to be the same kind of person as Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They aren&rsquo;t really arguing, but more like a routine quarrel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Silly, you know I&rsquo;ll win anyway, why would I look for you to fight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I see you&rsquo;ve gotten tired of living. Today I&rsquo;m feeling super good you know!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way. You look like you&rsquo;ve shrunk. Have you grown smaller since the last time we met?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it! I&rsquo;ve been reincarnating lately!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris once said that it would take a couple hundred years before she could grow up. After asking for details, I was informed that she was only reincarnated about fifty years ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With her saying that, Dino seems to realize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s why you look like this. Sounds pretty convenient. But, will the memories be carried over?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course it will. But my spirit will devolve because of my body. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter since I&rsquo;m the strongest. That&rsquo;s why I need to let loose at times like this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Guy, Ramiris seems to want to say something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Baka! Are you an idiot! I know what to say to the right person! I&rsquo;ve never even thought of beating down Guy in one punch! (one pun~)&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Dino trying to talk to the red-haired man, Ramiris immediately stops him. She begins to find excuses with her voice lowered to mumble her complaint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s only good at words and is super quick to change her stance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that red-hair dude, sounds like he is indeed Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He must be dangerous given how panicked Ramiris looks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Secretly, I take note that &ldquo;Guy is dangerous&rdquo;. I once avoided danger with this type of miniscule diligence, so I can&rsquo;t underestimate its usage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to avoid provoking Guy, Ramiris and the rest only dare to whisper their conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The content seems to be related to Ramiris&rsquo; servants&mdash;Beretta and Treyni-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris is showing off big time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehh? Why didn&rsquo;t you come by yourself, how come you brought servants this time? Won&rsquo;t I look uncool coming alone ?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh huh, yep. Now I can get back from those Demon Lords who call me a shrimp and say I&rsquo;m all alone without any love! Especially you! I&rsquo;ll let you know how useless you are against these two!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right then, wanna try to let them fight against me? Would it be alright if I break them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah? You&rsquo;d better not! If you break them, I&rsquo;ll go tell Guy and let him punish you with his iron fists!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Part of that line sounds like a bluff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris is just going to call for help without any shame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I mean these two, they probably can put up a good fight, right? They look really strong now that I look more closely!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Dino&rsquo;s remark, Beretta and Treyni-san both nod quietly in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">*Sigh* what a waste to give these subordinates to Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right? Right! That&rsquo;s true, that means I speak with greater authority now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dino&rsquo;s words greatly please her as Ramiris shows her dominance by raising her flat chat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it was me who helped making them two. Never mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta and Treyni-san remain silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are both very competent servants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Similarly, behind me, Shion is silent too&mdash;and sleeping. I hope she would learn something from those two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dino goes on to his own seat after the greeting, face slacked. His seat is next to Valentine. He seems like an ancient Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He ignores Valentine beside him and more surprisingly, starts to sleep on the table right away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Valentine probably finds him extremely rude, but greetings between Demon Lords may be the actual anomaly here. Although Dino was running his mouth to tease Ramiris, his greeting to her may indeed be just an exception.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dino seems very unmotivated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It gives off the vibe of &ldquo;Simply coming is enough&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He doesn&rsquo;t care about the atmosphere of the meeting, simply playing the part of a sloth. In a sense he is a contrarian of his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His disregard for everything in turn, reflects his potent strength that enables such actions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip; I&rsquo;ll just consider that to be the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This guy also seems to have a blockade against analysis, his real power remains unknown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I want to analyze him but instead he stares back with his eyes slightly lifted. He is indeed keeping his guard up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His interaction with Ramiris just before reflected his arrogant personality, so this guy can&rsquo;t be underestimated after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Dino did seem like he&rsquo;s treating Ramiris well. If possible, I don&rsquo;t want to antagonize him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next, the Harpy Queen enters the meeting room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim once mentioned her to me, she must be Demon Lord Frey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her aura (sex appeal) is overflowing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her pair of breasts seem to have quite the air resistance, won&rsquo;t she feel inconvenient during flights?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh no, I accidently went astray. I&rsquo;m just a bit moved by how impactful her entry is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of Frey, she looks towards me from Milim&#39;s empty seat, and her eyes fall on me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way she squints at people is also so sexy&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ahhhhhh, this is truly&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she passes by me, her body fragrance also smells so good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These thoughts keep swirling through my head; however, I sense a dangerous aura at my back. Obviously Shion is getting pissed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s found out that I was almost seduced, as expected of Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be a bad idea to make Shion get any angrier. I switch back to normal observation mode immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her magicules are nothing special. If I have to be honest, it&rsquo;s even smaller than that of Shion and Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On that note, Shion&rsquo;s magicule count is catching up to Valentine, so her magicules aren&rsquo;t little at all. But its quality is the key. It would be too superficial to judge by its quantity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The qualities of the two are hard to be distinguish by their breast sizes&mdash;Eh, that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be relevant. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suppose she must have a lot of hidden skills. She has a certain dangerous aura surrounding her, so it&rsquo;s not too far-fetched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s about all the information I can extract from Frey, but there&rsquo;s one point worth pointing out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is the servants around her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of whom is a busty beauty who can rival Frey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She still seems somewhat childish, but her figure is still top notch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other person is a tough guy possessing similar magicule levels to Frey. It is likely a male Harpy given the giant eagle wings on his back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s quite small compared to Dagruel, but he is just as fit as Valentine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His face is covered by a lion mask, rendering me unable to analyze him. But&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lion?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. According to the deduction of &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo;&mdash;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s no way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This person is on a completely different wavelength than Karion. There&rsquo;s no way that&rsquo;s him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; won&rsquo;t tell me, I can deduce this easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&hellip;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he is indeed the missing Karion, he definitely wouldn&rsquo;t resort to such a disguise full of flaws to the Walpurgis Banquet. He would have been more careful and cautious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Someone once said that there will be three people in the world who looks similar to oneself</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup><span class="c1">. Frey&rsquo;s servant must be someone else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After observing Frey&rsquo;s group, I suddenly have the illusion that freezing wind is blowing into the room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I look towards that direction and witness the entry of a blonde beauty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is a beauty blessed with endorsement of gods.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such a beauty walks straight towards me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Are you Rimuru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, and who are you&mdash;I intend to ask back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t know this type of gorgeous beauty. But upon thinking so, I suddenly figure out his true identity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are four more Demon Lords. With one of them being the missing Karion, we only have Clayman and Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then it is Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I remember Leon has blonde hair&mdash;so called &ldquo;Platinum Demon&rdquo;, the beautiful blonde Demon Lord&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;So, are you Leon? Why would you want to have a word with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I am Leon. I didn&rsquo;t come to you for anything in particular. It is just that I feel a sense of nostalgia seeing your face.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is indeed Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What a beautiful man, it may mislead people easily to think that he&rsquo;s a beautiful woman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If it&rsquo;s me from the past, I would definitely shout in heart &ldquo;WHAT THE HELL! (IT&rsquo;S A TRAP!)</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt40" id="ftnt_ref40">[40]</a></sup><span class="c1">&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He used to be human, yet he gives off an imposing aura.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He indeed has the presence of a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of which, did Leon say he feels nostalgic? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I look the exact same as when Shizue-san was young. In other words, Leon&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leon, Shizue-san has already passed away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t come to me for anything in particular, simply being reminiscent of Shizue-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know. Of course she would die. Simply because she refused to accept Ifrit and didn&rsquo;t want to become a Majin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon says it lighted-heartedly as if it was only natural.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She once asked me to punch you in the face. Please allow me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The line slips out of my mouth without my thinking. I wasn&rsquo;t trying to look for trouble, but Leon&rsquo;s attitude is irritating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I say it clear and straight. But Leon is not moved by it at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I refuse. I&rsquo;ve given Shizue a chance to choose for her own life. She didn&rsquo;t want to become a Majin and wanted to live as a human. I even gifted her Ifrit when we parted, so there&rsquo;s no reason for you to punch me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s surprising.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I would have thought he&rsquo;d get mad and call me rude. Yet he responds to me calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides from that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;However, I&rsquo;m also a little bit interested in you. If you want to complain to me, my treat. Or you can refuse if you think it&rsquo;s a trap. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter either way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He says so himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It feels as though he&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come if you are scared&rdquo;, so I could only accept.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll accept. Remember to send an invitation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I go silent after my response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon nods his head slightly but with an annoyed twitch at how troublesome he thinks it would be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, I&rsquo;ll do just that. But first, you have to return in one piece.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wraps up coldly and takes the seat on my left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s not going to talk to me anymore. That&rsquo;s probably the end of that conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be enough progress on the matter for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve relayed Shizue-san&rsquo;s words and I now know one more thing: Leon is not trying to make me an enemy. If he has considered me an enemy, why would he agree to send an invitation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem lies on what happens after that. Anyhow, I need to focus on dealing the enemy that is Clayman.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s been an hour since the time I first entered the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Time passed on just like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The order of leading the Demon Lords into the meeting room seems to be based on their experience. I was a guest, so I happened to have the privilege to travel with Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there&rsquo;s also someone like Leon who came in by his own strength, that doesn&#39;t seem to be a written rule.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now all there is left are Clayman and Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just when the Banquet was about to start, a thought flashed through my mind&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, is it convenient for me to borrow some time of yours to report our progress?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s Benimaru, he&rsquo;s communicating through &ldquo;Telepathy Net&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The meeting seems to be in a different dimension, so how did &ldquo;Telepathy Net&rdquo; come through&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. You&rsquo;ve established connection with monsters under your rule with &ldquo;Soul Corridor&rdquo;. You can communicate through it.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;So that&rsquo;s how it worked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that during my blessing, &ldquo;Soul Corridor&rdquo; was connected as well. It feels weaker than the one I use to contact Veldora, but it seems to work fine with communication.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I begin to listen to Benimaru&rsquo;s report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s been less than an hour since the war started, yet it&rsquo;s already over. It sounds like it has been going exactly as planned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our army has many injured but zero casualties. As for Clayman&rsquo;s army, there is more than a thousand deaths. There are over three thousand injured as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a surprisingly low death toll, but in this world, as long as one is alive, there is a chance of restoring them to their original state. So it&rsquo;s reasonable many weren&rsquo;t killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, we achieved complete victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we caught prisoners, hooray!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The commanding officer of the enemies seems to have turned into Charybdis somehow, but was incinerated by Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am a bit out of loop with what he&rsquo;s saying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since I can&rsquo;t understand, I&rsquo;ll just skip it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although it is best that I skip it, but&hellip; How did he kill Charybdis when it has &ldquo;Magic Interference&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. His unique skill &ldquo;Great General&rdquo; can compile multiple techniques and skills to perfectly control &ldquo;Black Flame Prison&rdquo;.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In short, his manipulation technique was superior than &ldquo;Magic Interference&rdquo; and was able to directly input massive amounts of heat. It may sound easy, but it requires quite the level of skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru seems to have grown stronger than I&rsquo;ve anticipated. Very impressive!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we didn&rsquo;t anticipate however, was the Worshipers of Dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are worthy as Milim&rsquo;s believers and seems to be an absurdly powerful battle group. They didn&rsquo;t engage with us seriously this time and thus allowed us to prevent casualties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I should be the one to reflect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It turns out I was wrong when I thought they would be no problem due to their only being one hundred in number.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I should have known better that war in this world depends on personal strength rather than the power of a group. I seem to have carelessly forgotten such common sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s most fortunate that we didn&rsquo;t get beaten to a pulp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We must be more careful next time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Benimaru&rsquo;s report, I have an overall idea of what Clayman will claim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is said that Clayman&rsquo;s army, alongside Midley&rsquo;s group under Yamza&rsquo;s rule, is famously marching to investigate Karion&rsquo;s betrayal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is in order to collect evidence about Karion&rsquo;s betrayal of the Demon Lords and murder of Clayman&rsquo;s subordinate and my accomplice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, that&rsquo;s not true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not &lsquo;collecting&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;fabricating&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now his plan has been disrupted due to our victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wonder if he will find some other reasons later, but I doubt the other Demon Lords would agree with that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyhow, we will take down Clayman in the end, one way or another. If any Demon Lord gets in our way, we will just have to eliminate them as well, in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we have to work hard now to make life easier for us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raphael-sama, I look forward to your performance!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&hellip;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; seems very motivated as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I can be relieved for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, Souei is also reporting in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seems to have taken Clayman&rsquo;s base.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei is really badass. I heard he also had Hakurou to back him up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the most active member must have been Shuna.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems some drama has occurred and for some reason, she has gained some undead monster as companions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am rather confused but Souei said &ldquo;We will have Shuna-sama brief you on the specifics&mdash;&rdquo;. And that&rsquo;s equally baffling to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The important thing is that Demon Lord Karion was not detained in Clayman&rsquo;s castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there&rsquo;s something else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&mdash;We&rsquo;ve discovered a secret vault. We&rsquo;ve contacted Geld to conduct the transfer. There is also evidence of Clayman&rsquo;s association with the Moderate Clown Troupe. Please use them to your desire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They seem to have robbed all of Clayman&rsquo;s treasures he&rsquo;s collected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is it considered thievery?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, I shouldn&rsquo;t care about that. Clayman has brought us trouble, so I&rsquo;ll take his compensation with gratitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seems to have hidden many treasures in his time, so now our financial gain has gone over the roof.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In comparison, the more important evidence has been collected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru and Souei have both mentioned it to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of the evidence has been transmitted to my &ldquo;Stomach&rdquo;. With it, I can topple all of Clayman&rsquo;s claims and sources.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s important to keep my reputation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like that, we&rsquo;ve decimated Clayman&rsquo;s forces at a much faster pace than I expected. Now we&rsquo;ll see how he reacts. We&rsquo;ll use all of our information to its fullest to put the favor on our side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soon afterward&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I finish listening to the report, Clayman&rsquo;s party finally shows up.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is surprisingly a handsome man, but at the same time, he looks somewhat psychotic&mdash;This man is Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wears classy clothing that seems very fashionable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This Demon Lord is indeed something else. He has special grade equipment all over his body. These alone seem to be able to form a strong combat force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What concerns me more is the fox he is holding. Its monstrous power is extremely powerful, as well as its astonishing amount of magicules. Its power may reach that of a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is one of the servants&mdash;correction, it is. But since Clayman is a Demon Lord after all, his subordinates are pretty good as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My &ldquo;Analysis &ldquo; of Clayman has revealed something rather concerning. Although we&rsquo;ve taken his base, we still can&rsquo;t underestimate him, especially while wrapping up the end of our operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Following just after is Milim; so now all of the Demon Lords are present.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone here is a monster not to be underestimated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I tried to run &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo; for Leon as well, yet was unable to analyze his power. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How interesting, &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; also says it can&rsquo;t be analyzed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, he has a similar skill to me&mdash;Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, abruptly I realize something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy is leaking fake intel to others&mdash;Is it to counter Ultimate Skills?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If one is unable to be analyzed through Ultimate Skill, it means the opponent possesses an Ultimate Skill as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s quite possible that he has released simply false information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am only able to realize this because &rdquo;Wisdom King Raphael &ldquo; is very strong. Had I discovered this, I would have also been deceived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that logic, Guy naturally has an Ultimate Skill as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milus? Highly suspicious, and the same can be said about Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultimate Skills all possess special yet incomparable functions. There are several important conditions in acquiring them, such as the user&rsquo;s ability, luck and timing. It is rumored that a rare skill isn&rsquo;t guaranteed even when someone becomes a True Demon Lord. Such power is indeed the ace up users&rsquo; sleeve. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I need to act more cautiously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, I need to assume Guy has also realized that I have an Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a grave miscalculation on my part.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s all because of my lack of experience. My opponents are all cunning Demon Lords. I need to be much more careful in keeping my guard up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No use crying over spilled milk; it is not a major misstep for now. How I would deal with it in the future is more important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is also difficult to grasp my true ability, just like Dwarf King Gazel and his mind reading ability. It would also mean that my opponents won&rsquo;t be able to tell the specifics of my abilities, so I don&rsquo;t need to worry myself over it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d rather try to mislead him using this and pretend that I&rsquo;m oblivious on the matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be more specific, I need to hide &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo;. It won&rsquo;t hurt if others see my other Ultimate Skills then, if I always have Raphael as my trump card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I do so, won&rsquo;t I have a trump card that will never be discovered?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is what I can do with possession of four different Ultimate Skills, a rather bold way to hide my skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could show them off during my battle against Clayman later, when it comes to it, then I&rsquo;ll&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Proposal. &ldquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rdquo; is very hard to conceal.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can consume and dissipate dispersed attacks, a skill both capable of attack and defense. My combat abilities are mostly based of &ldquo;Prey&rdquo;, so it would be a good idea to show &ldquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rdquo; to the public.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In future battles I&rsquo;ll focus on using &ldquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rdquo; while hiding other skills. I&rsquo;ll adapt this tactic into all my fights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I should be happy today that I got to come up with this new tactic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be meaningless if I&rsquo;m not willing to use my skills and end up dead because of it. If I can leave this place safely, I&rsquo;ll reconsider a new tactic after that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as I finish my reflection, I suddenly see something astounding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Move faster, you retard!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman spits as he suddenly hits Milim violently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitting Milim&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Too damn slow, go and sit down right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He even poses all high and mighty after hitting and giving Milim orders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m on the edge of becoming furious, but I push it back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not time yet, I just need to endure a little bit more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before he moves on to start speaking according to the rules of Banquet, I have to hold on to my anger&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of which, what in the world happened to Milim?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim being bullied like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the two were to switch places and have Clayman being the one hit, it would be a normal and a typical sight to see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, what a poor guy, and that would be it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was violent towards Milim and beating her, yet he was not punished for it at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim didn&rsquo;t resist, not even having a word of complaint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She remains obedient and sits in her seat without a word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How strange.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could Milim really be under Clayman&rsquo;s control? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that I need to consider the worst-case scenario.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides I am not the only one surprised at it, other Demon Lords such as Dagruel and Dino also exchange confused looks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t change at all, there is no way to know what he is thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman on the other hand looks all superior and smug.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing his face, my fury is again ignited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you think you will get a quick death Clayman. I&rsquo;ll make you pay for hitting my friend, Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I promise in my heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is dead meat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I won&rsquo;t let him walk away, no matter what reason he has.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I can&rsquo;t rush it just yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Banquet is about to begin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The participants of the Walpurgis Banquet are as following:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ten Great Demon Lords, minus Karion, nine Demon Lords in total.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demon&mdash;&rdquo;Lord of Darkness&rdquo; Guy Crimson.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dragonoid&mdash;&rdquo;Destroyer&rdquo; Milim Nava.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fairy&mdash;&rdquo;Fairy of Labyrinth&rdquo; Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Titan&mdash;&rdquo;Rage of Earth&rdquo; Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vampire&mdash;&rdquo;Bloody Lord&rdquo; Roy Valentine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fallen Angel&mdash;&rdquo;Sleeping Ruler&rdquo; Dino.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harpy&mdash;&rdquo;Sky Queen&rdquo; Frey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Undead Elf&mdash;&rdquo;Marionette Master&rdquo; Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ex-Human&mdash;&rdquo;Platinum Saber&rdquo; Leon Cromwell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one other person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The protagonist of this Banquet&rsquo;s subject-matter, the one who dares to proclaim to be a new Demon Lord&mdash;Me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of Guy&rsquo;s maids named Rain begins to introduce everyone with a cold tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m most interested in Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuse once told me that Demon Lord Leon has the nickname &ldquo;Platinum Demon&rdquo;, but now it is changed into a cooler title of &ldquo;Platinum Saber&rdquo;,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He does give off the look of it, but who on earth came up with these titles?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could it be himself&mdash;No&hellip; I shouldn&rsquo;t say that. I&rsquo;m not qualified to judge other people. Let&rsquo;s try to avoid this type of topic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s about it as the introduction comes to a conclusion, when Clayman stands up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, I much appreciate everyone to have answered the invitation to the Banquet today. We shall now begin our feast! I hereby announce the official unveiling of the Walpurgis Banquet!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He announces the start of the meeting as the meeting holder, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that, with the foreshadowing feeling of imminent storm, Walpurgis Banquet is officially convened.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman leaves his seat and in a swoop as transforming the meeting room into his personal stage, he begins his speech.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looks rather satisfied, glancing around at all the Demon Lords, including me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His eyes seem to have stopped at Demon Lord Valentine, but that might have just been a trick of the light. It&rsquo;s none of my business either way, I may have just thought too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon is sitting to my left, while the seat on my right is empty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One seat over my right would be Clayman&rsquo;s seat. On his right is an empty seat that belongs to Karion who has gone missing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman starts explaining the cause of this whole ordeal rather smugly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His words are prolix and lengthy, but I still decide to listen to them seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here&rsquo;s what he has to say:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One, Demon Lord Karion has instigated me to proclaim myself a Demon Lord. The evidence for this is that Karion&rsquo;s army stationed in our town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two, Rimuru instigated Farmus Kingdom to attack the Great Jura Forest. This also served as an excuse for Rimuru to attack the humans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three, I (Rimuru) defeated Farmus Kingdom and proclaimed myself Demon Lord with Karion secretly backing me up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He thinks Karion&rsquo;s actions were violations to the rules among the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman&#39;s claims has completely overlooked the actual chronology of events. They are all excuses but are hard to prove otherwise. His accusation is much more discreet than I expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, his accusations of our actions happen to be after the Demon Lords&rsquo; non-aggression pact of Jura Great Forest was withdrawn. So the evidence of crime is all clear.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 629.98px; height: 917.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image12.png" style="width: 629.98px; height: 917.50px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what the hell does any of them have to do with me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman adds on even more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;through this, I stand by my testimony. However, my subordinate Myuran who reported me all this have been murdered by that donkey named Rimuru. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve decided to avenge her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What an act! Clayman&rsquo;s so good at acting that my praise almost slipped out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m almost moved to tears by his performance&mdash;like hell I am. Myuran is still alive!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This Rimuru has planned with Karion to kill me. Myuran was able to inform me of it with her last bit of strength through &lsquo;Magic Communication&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon saying so, Clayman looks rather emotional. It could almost be a piece of art, with how handsome he looks, but I&rsquo;m still pissed with how fond he is of acting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Did Clayman say that I want to kill him and take his seat as Demon Lord?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that the one behind this scheme was Karion? What a story he has come up with. Karion has the integrity of a samurai (warrior), so people who know him would probably burst into laughter hearing this story. All of these are just sophistry&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Clayman finishes his speech with a tangent, focusing on Karion&rsquo;s betrayal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because of that, Milim losing her nerve, went to destroy the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania, killing Kairon in the process&mdash;These are his claims.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion was killed? It&rsquo;s very suspicious how he hasn&rsquo;t mentioned that Karion has gone missing. It doesn&rsquo;t seem right, so I&rsquo;ll see what Clayman has to say about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim was doing all of this for Clayman&rsquo;s sake, but Clayman scolded her later about how it was inappropriate without evidence. After the incident, Milim began admiring Clayman and asked for his help a lot&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to get his hands on evidence of the collusion between me and Karion after his subordinate was killed, Clayman decided to march. Such is his narrative of the events.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He also mentioned that I was going to kill him and claim to be a Demon Lord afterward, which he couldn&rsquo;t tolerate and thus decided to lure me out and execute me through the verdict of the Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is truly impressive how he can make up such a story that puts so much favor on his side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But with that being said, his explanation is too lengthy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was going to listen to Clayman&rsquo;s arguments and come up with my own points to argue back in hopes of proving my innocence and defeating Clayman reasonably.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the only reason why I&rsquo;ve listened to him so patiently for all this time, but now I can&rsquo;t tolerate it anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is it not time to strike?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After hearing Clayman&rsquo;s words, I discover the fatal flaw in his argument.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no evidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from testimony, Clayman&rsquo;s claims are not backed up by any other evidence. And upon inspecting this testimony, they are mostly from Clayman&rsquo;s loyal servant&mdash;Ring Finger Myuran.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What a joke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myuran is still alive, so his testimony has little to no credibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem that he didn&rsquo;t have time to fabricate evidence. Now I can finally prove my innocence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have already prepared key evidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;As such, I am done. Now that everyone has learnt about the story from start to finish, this Rimuru here is a despicable Majin and an idiot for daring to proclaim himself as a Demon Lord. It is best if we eliminate him&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman says so as he was concluding for his explanation looking all high and mighty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Demon Lords are quite patient, having willingly listened to his boring and lengthy story. But someone did fall asleep among them, but he won&rsquo;t pose trouble so it&rsquo;s understandable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rules seem to say that everyone has to listen to the speaker finish explaining without a word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is at this point when the Demon Lords apparently may express their opinions freely. However, this time they have me as both the guest and the person in question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rain seems to be appointed as host, as the maid looks towards me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, allow me to explain to everyone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s finally my turn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve endured till now. Now to stop dancing with this clown. (D: Literally)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are Clayman, right? I mean, you are just a giant liar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna be honest with you; I don&rsquo;t care whether or not I become a Demon Lord. The thing you said about Karion-san&rsquo;s instigation was all nonsense. And the Farmus Kingdom attacked due to their greed. The two incidents have no connection whatsoever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I say so as Clayman throws an annoyed glare at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh! Who would believe such excuses? My subordinate also got killed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He adds, which plays right into my court.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is she called Myuran? I didn&rsquo;t kill her, she&rsquo;s still alive, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ha! And I thought you were&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyway, listen up now. All of your claims have been mere hearsay and your personal deduction. It may work for more gullible people, but I won&rsquo;t buy it. Your witness Myuran is now under my protection. I won&rsquo;t allow you to do a thing to her, and your testimony has zero credibility.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon saying so, even Clayman&rsquo;s expression changed drastically. But he seems to only disagree with my statements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehe, how despicable of you to do such a thing. You must have done something to Myuran&rsquo;s corpse and allowed an evil spirit to possess her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He immediately questions my claim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, there is magic in this world that can even hide ambiguity of life and death. What a headache to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It thus means that the testimony doesn&rsquo;t anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It would seem that you&rsquo;ve decided to deny everything. That&rsquo;s why I was being clear with you, but I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. Before the Banquet started, my companions assisted me in collecting evidence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I say so with much disdain in my eyes towards Clayman as I smile slightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is enraged by the sight. This guy seems simpler than I expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean by that? If you wish to die so badly then&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get ahead of yourself now, Clayman. I told you that I have evidence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I interrupt Clayman and take out a couple of crystal balls from my pocket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The crystal ball is then transferred to the center of the round table and activates its magical effect one by one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every crystal ball carries a video recording.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is footage of the fights between my subordinates and Orc Lord through Gelmud&rsquo;s point of view. These are all discovered by Shuna from the ancient castle at Clayman&rsquo;s base.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, there are also crystal balls recording the battle that just concluded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are from Benimaru as he&rsquo;d recorded every bit of the battle under his watch and from his memory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are some interesting scenes in them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;S-stop! Please don&rsquo;t do this, Clayman-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s Clayman&rsquo;s subordinate screaming as his body turns into an incomplete version of Charybdis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;What a surprise, but I knew Yamza would betray&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Clayman&rsquo;s army is routed. The mission is a failure. We&rsquo;ve suffered a lot of loss&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Even Laplace went to persuade him, it&rsquo;s all Clayman&rsquo;s fault this time&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We have to report to that Lord&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In front of Geld and Phobio, the suspicious clowns conversed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are the members of Moderate Clown Troupe, Footman and Tear. It must be since they also mentioned Laplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I originally thought that Clayman was behind the scenes all this times but as it turns out someone else was behind Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could it be&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. These series of events are all related to him.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Of course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This mysterious man who has been pulling the strings in the dark, setting me against Hinata and manipulating Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why the timings were so precise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was battling the Western Saints Church, Clayman had the chance to instigate Farmus Kingdom and that led to the tragedy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could understand simply seeing me as an eye-sore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But you&rsquo;ve crossed the line this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I will take all of you down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t blame me. After all, this is the jungle for the survival of the fittest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s called proof, Clayman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I say with a victorious smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be honest, it&rsquo;s much easier to do things with evidence. But there are still plenty of ways to resolve things without it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, we could just beat the crap out of him in a fair fight and then find some reason to get ourselves by the blames just like what Clayman is trying to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not about right or wrong, but about our image.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now with real evidence presented, he won&rsquo;t have any comeback.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;S-stop it! What nonsense is this?! How dare you try to bluff your way out with forged, fake footage made by magic. Don&rsquo;t try such dirty tricks, you slime!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bluffing? That&rsquo;s not bluffing at all, baka~ We decimated your army. And you are next.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman looks at me angrily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;E-everyone don&rsquo;t get fooled by him! This slime called Rimuru is really good at bluffing. He unlocked the seal of Veldora and eliminated the Farmus army with him. Then he claims that it was his own power to show off, what a scumbag! No real Demon Lord would be fooled by this guy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman throws everything he has to continue his act.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How dare you try finding someone to back yourself up now, aren&rsquo;t you the real scum of the earth?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be really impressive if you do is just act all of this out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi, Clayman. Didn&rsquo;t you just say that this Rimuru provoked Farmus Kingdom? If it&rsquo;s true that Veldora has been revived, why would he bother to trouble himself by doing all this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s because&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question came from an unexpected place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dagruel speaks up and questions Clayman with much majesty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is troubled for a while and decides to go all out with his response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, then allow me to explain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Clayman begins to explain, exaggerating and overstating it once more, using body language to convey it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If one is to collect human souls, one will awake to become a True Demon Lord&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seems to have hidden this matter in hope of preventing the other Demon Lords to get the benefits of it first. Now that Dagruel has asked, he has to open up and state things clearly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;This reckless, lowly slime was lucky enough to evolve to the Demon Lord Breed. Then he went over the line to have human society investigate the truth. After which he presumptuously caused a war between human and monster. And orchestrated a massacre using Veldora who has been sealed and allowed it to rampage out in the world. Our reputation as Demon Lord will plummet as a result. That&rsquo;s why I think we must eliminate him, what do you all think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With his emphasized body language, Clayman attempts to persuade the other Demon Lords of his case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So what, you would need evidence for that. Can you even give us that? You&rsquo;re daydreaming if you think that would work. No one here would approve what you are proposing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman stares at me with hatred, but he can stare all he wants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m tired of his nonsense. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehh&hellip; Don&rsquo;t you look down on me, you slime, bluffing just because you have the power of the evil dragon! Likes of you could never become a Demon Lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s irrelevant whether or not I am a slime. Besides Veldora is my friend. But I have not come here to listen to your nonsense. You should just give up and just admit that those clowns followed </span><span class="c2 c16">your </span><span class="c1">instructions in reviving the Charybdis. The Majin called Phobio in those footages can testify that he&rsquo;s been encouraged by that clown &ldquo;Footman&rdquo;! Moreover, your subordinate just caused a havoc after transforming into Charybdis. This is all clear evidence. Call me a bluff if you want, but you can go to hell, thinking that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I kick off the chair next to me to get up and contend against Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I put forward my hand casually put it where my hand is about to touch at the round table. The gigantic round table disappears instantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is nothing surprising about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s simply consumed by my &ldquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I&rsquo;ve cleared out a large space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The kicked chair flew on behind Clayman and collides against the wall loudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Demon Lords don&rsquo;t seem to be moved by it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only one scared is Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone, how can you tolerate such violent behavior from this guy!? He&rsquo;s even ignoring our authority. We should punish him together!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Together he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As expected, this guy is real scum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stand up entirely and move towards the center of the empty round space surrounded by chairs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, I don&rsquo;t care whether I become Demon Lord or not. I just want to create a country satisfactory for myself. I need human help in that aspect, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve decided to protect the humans. If anyone dares to intrude, whether they be humans, Demon Lords or the Saints Church, they are all my enemies. For instance, you, Clayman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I take an even more avid approach compared to Clayman and announce my ideal in front of the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHAT&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As for violent behavior, you said, did you plan to attend the Walpurgis Banquet while trying to mind control others?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I fix my eyes on Clayman and ask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He must think I didn&rsquo;t notice. He was quite arrogant, thinking he could cast a psychic attack on me halfway through his speech.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He probably wanted to control me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it won&rsquo;t work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Simply because &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; is always protecting me. Attacks like that will always be nullified instantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But with that being said, I now have a justified approach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could argue that, in a sense, Clayman was the one who struck first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If any other Demon Lords dare to confront me on this, I&rsquo;ll see what to do with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I make up my mind to resort to violence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But after I said so with much resolve. Unexpectedly, it is not Clayman who responds, but the top seat and the dominator of the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. Here, everyone is equal, and everyone can express his opinion of others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The red-haired Demon Lord Guy says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looks rather intrigued, giving off a small smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But Guy, this guy is insulting the Demon Lords&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cut the crap. You don&rsquo;t see me eye to eye, so shouldn&rsquo;t it be a problem between us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Clayman. You are a Demon Lord as well. Then go and defeat this Majin by yourself. And you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy tells Clayman to shut up and looks towards me while saying:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you want to be a Demon Lord?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Since I&rsquo;ve already taken the position as the leader of the Jura Great Forest Alliance. The humans have seen me as a Demon Lord for a long time now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They won&rsquo;t care about the story; all they will care about is that I&rsquo;ve collaborated with the evil dragon in taking over the forest. That&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t deny even if people call me a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very well, everyone here shall be the witness. If you can beat Clayman here and now, we&rsquo;ll approve your becoming a Demon Lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy announces to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I can defeat Clayman, we can settle everything nicely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s just what I want.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman quickly regains his composure and begins to laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gogogo, my goodness. I plotted all this, so I won&rsquo;t get my hands dirty, yet things got even more complicated than I expected. How unwise I was.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman says so while laughing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is he accepting the reality?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman he laughs at me coldly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for you to shine, Milim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He says so calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The atmosphere immediately becomes much, much more tense; even the Demon Lords become nervous along with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although some of them retain their same, casual expression and posture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My eyes also fall on Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has kept shown his hand&mdash;Milim is under his control. It seems that this has made Clayman quite confident.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up to this point, Clayman would exploit her without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim is indeed being manipulated&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are truly amazing at running your mouth. With all these said, how could you still rely on other people in the end? Now you dare to involve Milim. I&rsquo;ll beat some sense into you then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I attempt to provoke Clayman with these words, but&hellip; Clayman is no fool, not foolish enough to fall for it anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How boring. It goes without saying that I will fight as well. Guy, do you have an objection?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not at all, Clayman. If Milim is willingly helping you, then I won&rsquo;t interfere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is no good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman alone is fine, but Milim is very strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy agrees without thinking, it would seem that I have to confront Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If my opponent is Milim, I won&rsquo;t be able to beat her with my current power level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides I want to find a way to save her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, I must save her!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, Milim, who seems to be frozen, seems to be holding her fist tight, looking no difference from a doll and raises her hands to do a victory pose&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;No, that was just an instant, maybe I&rsquo;ve been mistaken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seriously, what a poor thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m gonna save you soon, Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I swear to myself in heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right then. I was planning to save Milim anyway, I&rsquo;ll break your brainwashing technique if it takes everything I have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Surely you jest! And you will die trying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are the one who&rsquo;s going to die, Clayman. If it were against you alone, my subordinates will suffice. It would be bullying for me to fight you myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman&rsquo;s expression seems frozen by my words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s probably mad as he begins to dissipate black Youki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As expected from a Demon Lord. There is plenty of pressure in the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it feels pretty average.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, Clayman will probably show some openings because of his anger and anxiety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion is going to fight in my place, she&rsquo;s good at exploiting those traits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I signal with my eyes towards Shion and she takes action immediately. In a blink of an eye she closes in on her opponent and strikes towards Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She infuses her Youki into her fists and launches thirty something punches.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she turns back, looking delighted, and asks me: &ldquo;Is this okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oi, shouldn&rsquo;t you ask that before beating other people?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I only glanced at you once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Did you get it? Clayman has been provoked by my words, now take your chance!&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sent out such signal to her, but I didn&rsquo;t tell her to beat the enemy to a pulp in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then what&rsquo;s the point of me exposing enemies&rsquo; openings&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">*Sigh*, but what can you do when the man is already beaten.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman was launched flying due to the impact of the hits and fell in front of me. That is the middle ground of the empty round space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;B-bastard, you bastard&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman begins to shout out loud as he gets up from the ground. He is surprisingly durable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thick black Youki that wrapped around him suddenly thickens and heals all of his wounds instantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s much stronger regenerative ability compared to Orc Lord. But he is a Demon Lord, so abilities such as this should be normal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman seems to be targeting Shion as enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alright, things are going according to plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As you wish, I&rsquo;ll kill you all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By Clayman&rsquo;s order, the fox that ran to his feet begins to grow bigger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Warning. This is deduced to be the Nine-Head Beast Myuran mentioned.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh yeah, with that reminder, I do recall her mentioning this to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This fox indeed is no pet, but a powerful servant of his.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And another one of them emerges from the shadow of Clayman&rsquo;s black cape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem both of these are his servants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Back on our side, Shion is also preparing for battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ranga also begins to enlarge and prepares, falling into a battle stance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eh? Milim is also joining, we seem to be losing in terms of numbers&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No no no, it&rsquo;s no time to panic yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now Beretta could&mdash;Ah!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have all stepped into the circle that used to be the round table. This is a battle stage: once you&rsquo;ve stepped in, a barrier near the edge will completely cut you off from the outside. The space within also begins to expand, and the chairs outside of the circle now seem very far away. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to prevent the interference of other Demon Lords, a strong bound of barrier also seems to have been set up. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never mind, I was expecting this when I cleaned up the space for a stage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My helper Beretta has yet to enter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh no, I&rsquo;ve been tricked&mdash;As soon as the thought flashes, Clayman shouts loud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milim, kill that guy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He roars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim begins to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She begins to throw her iron fists at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The power of which are lethal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, my perception has been increased a million times by &ldquo;Thought Acceleration&rdquo;. With it I still have a chance to dodge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, I have a chance, nothing more than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The burning hard block scratches my face cheek.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The speed is incredibly fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; fully in use, I still can&rsquo;t dodge them perfectly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I attempt to counter, I will show openings and suffer a fatal blow. If that&rsquo;s the case, I can only try my best at keeping her occupied while trying to help her escape her brainwashed state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, I&rsquo;m using &ldquo;Magic Perception&rdquo; to show the situation around before me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Multitasking Rimuru is terrifying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now it&rsquo;s no time for joke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion is still fighting against Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, she&rsquo;s also fighting the black cape servant. It&rsquo;s hard to maintain an advantage while fighting two alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ranga is battling the Nine-Head Beast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I thought we had the upper hand, yet I see the Youko&rsquo;s three tails suddenly turn into two Majins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now it suddenly changed into a three on one. It&rsquo;s disadvantageous to Ranga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And lastly there&rsquo;s me, who needs to deal with Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve run out of options here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could only pray that I will survive long enough that my &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo; on Milim can be completed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m relying on them about what is coming after that!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With such feeling, our fight breaks out with us being in disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta takes action immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He ardently begged Ramiris to join the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris didn&rsquo;t refuse and ran to bother Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, Guy! I&rsquo;m on Rimuru&rsquo;s side and want to let my Beretta join the fight!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris begins to demand Guy not knowing her place, but Guy&rsquo;s response is very cold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is not buying it at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? This is a battle between Demon Lords. How could you let a mere servant join the fight. Besides, isn&rsquo;t it a fight between that slime and Clayman? Why is that any of your business?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so mean! Milim has also joined the battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, but that is fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is that supposed to mean? Why won&rsquo;t you allow me then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Annoying as hell&mdash;Guy thinks to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris was always an annoying fairy, and once she decides to be noisy she just won&rsquo;t stop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To this day Ramiris has never brought servants to the meeting. That&rsquo;s why Guy thought there must be some hidden motives why Ramiris has brought servants this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim also seems to be planning something, it will only make things more chaotic if Ramiris decides to join the battle. In order to prevent this from happening, Guy has intentionally separated the battle zone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you annoying, Milim is probably planning something on her own.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You say it as if I&rsquo;ve not come up with any genius plan!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it not that the case? Moreover&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he says so, Guy looks towards one of Ramiris&rsquo; servants, Beretta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Who&rsquo;s your servant loyal to? The other one&rsquo;s protecting you with all her heart, but this one really isn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s loyal to you on the surface, but is he completely loyal to you? Are you really fine with dealing with this type of unknown retainer?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy can tell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta is loyal to someone else besides Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris is an important friend of Guy&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s why he can&rsquo;t tolerate that her servant isn&rsquo;t completely loyal to his master.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are indeed right; I am comparing my master to someone else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta is not troubled hearing Guy&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His summoner is Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And his creator is Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet he also has another master, which is Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This Demon Lord is very optimistic, reckless everywhere she goes, curious like an infant and extremely timid. Beretta has grown a liking towards her and her personality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why he doesn&rsquo;t feel worn out by his job of being toyed around by her all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru wants him to protect Ramiris. He is also glad that he himself is able to serve Ramiris. So he doesn&rsquo;t feel conflicted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there is one point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta still wishes to repay Rimuru&rsquo;s kindness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is Rimuru who introduced him to Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was once of the Demon race. Rimuru was able to give him a new life and new duty&mdash;He wants to repay such kindness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Similar to my wish, Ramiris-sama also wants to save that Lord&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta asserts without restraint towards Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? You are not afraid of me and dare to talk straight to me. Interesting. Ramiris, is this guy speaking the truth?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy asks, but he realizes it&rsquo;s unnecessary as soon as he sees her expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm! Of course it&rsquo;s true! That&rsquo;s why Beretta, go in my place and save Rimuru!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehh&mdash;So this guy will carry out your wish. You&rsquo;ve recruited quite the servant, Ramiris.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t recruit him, I am his companion. Beretta, Treyni and Rimuru, too! And many, many, many more!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris says so with a joyful smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Never mind, I&rsquo;ll allow this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy doesn&rsquo;t know what Ramiris is trying to get out of this, but as long as she&rsquo;s happy it&rsquo;s fine. He does not object.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He puts forward his hand looking impatiently and opens a hole in the barrier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Many thanks, Primordial Red (Rouge).&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. Spare me the title. I&rsquo;ll allow you to call me Guy. But from now on, you can only recognize Ramiris as your master, do you understand?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Allowing him to call his name&mdash;To Guy, this means he has recognized Beretta&rsquo;s strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And right now, Guy wants Beretta to choose a master. If he doesn&rsquo;t, Guy plans to end him right there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Beretta agrees without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, Guy. I shall pledge my loyalty towards Ramiris. For that reason, please allow me help Rimuru-sama out this once.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy is a bit surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To the Demon race, their master must be strong enough. Yet Beretta doesn&rsquo;t seem to be interested in strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What an odd ideal. In other words, he is an outcast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Rimuru-sama has servants stronger than me to serve him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s the case, Guy thinks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he also begins to doubt. Beretta has openly admitted that someone is stronger than him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Besides, I really enjoy research. Everyday spent with Ramiris-sama researching is like a dream&mdash;Oh, apologies. Rimuru-sama also wishes for me to serve Ramiris-sama. There is no need for you to worry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing Beretta, Guy suddenly recalls a certain Demon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To pursue things that one desires and those only, that is the alternative definition for outcasts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From his type alone, it won&rsquo;t be anything strange to have given birth to a Demon with the personality similar to Beretta&mdash;But everyone knows that particular Demon do not create vessels often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, very few people know about him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have a question. Which branch (faction) are you from&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta turns his face up behind his mask, and a smile becomes visible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I am just a humble nobody, a Greater Demon. But, Demons from the same branch as mine are very rare.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rare system&mdash;Then it can be confirmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now Beretta&rsquo;s hair color has faded to silver, but its original color was probably&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. That&rsquo;s why you are not afraid of me. Your kind of Demon always do what your heart desires and put your personal feelings first. Does that mean you admit someone is stronger than you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy glances towards the battling Shion and Ranga and turns back to look at Beretta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion and Ranga are indeed strong. But Beretta is definitely not weaker.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I feel much honor receiving your praise, but my abilities are nothing to be mentioned. With that Lord serving Rimuru-sama, I won&rsquo;t have another chance to show my skills.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, I see. I understand how you feel. Go on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hole on the barrier is large enough for one person to pass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then excuse me for my leaving.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta bows elegantly before proceeding without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy smiles as he sees him off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has sensed what&rsquo;s weird.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He knows the one Beretta is talking about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">&mdash;Is that so? You are on the move too, Primordial Black (Noir)!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His old friend that parted way with him eons ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This newcomer has even recruited character like that. This slime battling Milim has suddenly become very intriguing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The outcast serves the outcast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">His name seems to be Rimuru. I&rsquo;ll remember it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With such thoughts, Guy observes the fight with delight. The result of which seems very obvious to him.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you ask me which part of this is bad, it would be Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Combating her is really strenuous, to the point that I&rsquo;ve even had to let go of my anger towards Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hasn&rsquo;t applied any combat style that Phobio hasn&rsquo;t seen yet (referring to vol 3 event), so she probably hasn&rsquo;t gone all out yet&hellip; But she is so overpowered to the point of unreasonable. I&rsquo;ve already been giving all I have.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; was able to display its power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be honest, I would be dead long ago if not because of the skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s about how I feel as I was busy fighting Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time, my subordinates are also fighting hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I originally thought that our number is down in this fight, however&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ranga has summoned two commander level vessels of Tempest Star Wolf, changing the three on one to three against three.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem that he could only summon three simultaneously. One of which has been summoned by Gobta so now he can&rsquo;t call for more reinforcements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that should be sufficient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nine-Head Beast has incredibly high amount of magicule storage, but it seems to be lacking in combat experience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ranga still have the upper hand when fighting it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, the two monsters summoned by Nine-Head Beast are surprisingly difficult to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They are White Ape and Moon Rabbit</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt41" id="ftnt_ref41">[41]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;according to results of my &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two are capable of conducting collaborated counter-attack with plenty high intelligence. It&rsquo;s very challenging to deal with. The Moon Rabbit is able to manipulate gravity to pressure the battle zone while the White Ape is flying all over the place while hitting down hard. The Nine-Head Beast on the other hand is responsible for delivering the fatal blow to enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This combat strategy is almost invincible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Ranga has seen through their tactic and disrupted the cooperative approach employed by the enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He could have used a more powerful attack to achieve victory, but he&rsquo;s afraid to affect Shion in that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is with the upper hand indeed, but he is able to deliver the final blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Shion&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is holding up with brute force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The black-cape is a delicate magic doll. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And honestly, it looks stronger than Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehehahahaha, how do you like my finest work Piorra? Isn&rsquo;t it dazzling?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is extremely confident, but not without his reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doll is undoubtedly powerful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, if you ask me whether it looks dazzling (pretty) or not, the answer it&rsquo;s no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because it is equipped with weapons all over its body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every item is a special grade weapon as well as its armor. Yet with too many of them stuck onto it, there isn&rsquo;t any sense of aesthetic at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fire, lightning, ice, heavy weight, resonance, as well as other attacks seem to be constantly poured out by it without an end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Shion doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind these attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Any enemy she encounters would have to deal with the troubling skill of &ldquo;Super Regeneration&rdquo;. Thanks to this skill, she can restore herself instantly no matter what type of attack she encounters to resolve the crisis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, due to the combined attack by Clayman and Piorra, she is unable to launch any attack. However, Shion&rsquo;s rage meter is also building up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be horrifying if all of her rage explodes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I thought so, someone entered to assist Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kept you waiting huh. Rimuru-sama, allow me to assist you all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh oh, it&rsquo;s Beretta!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t know how he got in, but Beretta was successful in entering this separated battle zone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been expecting you, Beretta!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How dare you interrupt our business&hellip; I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s gonna use these fools for blood sacrifice!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion is just being afraid of losing, they are just words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Be my guest. Beat the carp out of them!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Yes sir&mdash;!&rdquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that, the situation is proceeding as original plan.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our victory is imminent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although there were some unexpected interludes, but as how things have developed so far, we will definitely be the winner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If any problem&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s that Milim has yet to show any her true color so far.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as we rescue Milim, we would secure the win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I have no more worries and can focus myself entirely on Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The noises of my surrounding gradually disappear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My concentration is clear with Milim fixed in my eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The trajectory of her fists seems clearer now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I continue to concentrate my mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of the cells in my body are running at maximum proficiency to do the calculation. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would all be a waste if I lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I must find a way to remove the curse spell Clayman used to manipulate Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Come on, Raphael-san. Run &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo; at its full power!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You guys would probably say it&rsquo;s hypocritical that I just mocked other people for relying on others while I myself is relying on &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo;. You must have been mistaken; Raphael-san is my power after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am super reassured!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why, I&rsquo;m relying on you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo; result is&hellip; No data.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Huh? What now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ehhhh, what does that supposed to mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Does it mean that it didn&rsquo;t see through Clayman&rsquo;s curse?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;No curse spell was discovered. This&mdash;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oi oi oi, that&rsquo;s no casual matter that you can just get away with me calling you useless!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I thought I was unable to analyze because of my lack of focus, but then with all I have put into work now, I still can&rsquo;t break through it. Not only that, it didn&rsquo;t find any curse spell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raphael-san, you are surprisingly useless in this type of situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is bad, if this continues, I&rsquo;ll suffer a horrible death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My chances of victory against Milim in a toe-to-toe fight is truly low.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, then I don&rsquo;t have any other option. I have to keep Milim trapped with me before Shion and the rest beat Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to continue my confrontation with Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, my own ability has also improved greatly. Even though she has been manipulated and is not fighting with her true abilities, I still can put up a fight with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it&rsquo;s me in the past, I would have been beaten to the ground in less than a minute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet I&rsquo;ve been able to hold up the battle with all I have for dozens of minutes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Would it be possible for me to beat her out of her brainwash?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That thought cross my mind, but beating Milim is really against my personal principle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Proposal. Suggest to activate &ldquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rdquo; and attack by absorbing magicule.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh? Oh oh? I totally forgot that I could do that!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No time to lose then, let&rsquo;s try it out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll be the one to take damage from a frontal impact, so I need to use dissolving techniques in my offense. I&rsquo;ll use my force from the side to change trajectory of Milim&rsquo;s fists and kicks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then I&rsquo;ll used the interval for &ldquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rdquo; to absorb magicule. This seems to be very effective as Milim draws distance from me with annoyance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The damage caused was minimum, but it would suffice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Milim&rsquo;s attacks are all protected by her Dragon Aura, that&rsquo;s why the more I engage and absorb her dragon aura, the more stamina I can drain from Milim as it goes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s hope Shion would defeat Clayman soon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it&rsquo;s another issue whether I could win or not with this continues to repeat.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 652.50px; height: 954.35px;"><img alt="" src="images/image14.png" style="width: 652.50px; height: 954.35px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I truly wishes to win, I won&rsquo;t be able to reserve any of my power. But I may still lose even to this extent. And even if I win, I&rsquo;d be exposed of my powers in front of the other Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By that time, in terms of the overall situation, I would be the loser.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right considering my status, I can only continue on causing damage and wait for the cursed bond of Milim is removed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hope Shion would finish Clayman sooner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no way of knowing how much longer the attacks and defense on both sides would last.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or rather, I&rsquo;ve been in defense all these times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would be taken out if I has a miss. Under such serious circumstance, I was able to continuously dodge most of Milim&rsquo;s attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim&rsquo;s fist slashes over my right cheek with a low growl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My mind is not concentrated enough, and dodging has become impossible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she hits me head on, my body would shatter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I possess regenerative skill &ldquo;Infinite Regeneration&rdquo; that surpasses &ldquo;Super Regeneration&rdquo;, but using it too much would drain my magicule. I would still be able to revive after being shattering by her. But with repetition of this process, I&rsquo;ll be the first one to exhaust my stamina.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I must concentrate and concentrate more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I predict Milim&rsquo;s movement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The shape of her right fist suddenly changes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is a skill called &ldquo;Dragon Tooth&rdquo; that has been disguised as her fist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She threw it over my cheek just like before but unleashes her claw to slash my neck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is worthy of the name Dragon Tooth, my head would definitely be severed from my body. That&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t dodge this attack, but instead stop it from the side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim releases her Dragon Tooth while I move my left hand towards the outside to take the hit. I feel the burning sensation on my left hand. The intense energy exploded and my left hand which took on the attack has been gravely injured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what happens when I try to stop her attack alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only a madman would try to launch offense against her directly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The so-called power of an overlord is the ability to suppress opponents with just some power applied and form an instant kill skill. That is exactly what I&rsquo;ve been experiencing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, if I don&rsquo;t sacrifice my left hand, I would have suffered a fatal blow afterward. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s fine as it is. But Milim&rsquo;s reckless behavior is beginning to make me complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps my complaint has been answered as a heavenly opportunity appears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, Milim loses balance and throws out her iron fist with her left hand that has been at rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good chance!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Warning. It could be a trap&mdash;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time I made a sound of realization &ldquo;AHH!&rdquo; in my heart, it&rsquo;s all too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The calm analysis from &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; has been thrown behind my head as my attack has already been launched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was planning to grab onto her left hand and throw her out. Since Milim has lost balance, I thought I could pull an over-shoulder throw on her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if that was a trap set by Milim&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim&rsquo;s left hand suddenly paused as a smirk emerges on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s the expression when you succeed in pulling a trick.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">OHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOO&mdash;&mdash;!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now I am in a state of turning in Milim&rsquo;s view with both of my hands reaching out, trying to grab Milim&rsquo;s left hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can watch my own actions through third-person view by &ldquo;Magic Perception&rdquo;, what a posture full of openings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m done. GAME OVER.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Milim swings out her iron fist and is about to score a direct hit on my head&mdash;before she could hit, someone barged in between me and Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">DONG!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hear a sound of low blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Awoo! How can you suddenly hit people? Isn&rsquo;t that over the line?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A brown-skin blond man appears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He kinda looks like me&hellip; Eh, isn&rsquo;t this Veldora?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora is squatting down with his hands wrapped around his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks pretty painful. But he seems to only be slightly injured by the direct hit of Milim&rsquo;s iron fist, there isn&rsquo;t much to be worried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, Veldora, why are you here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took the chance and reposition myself and ask Veldora while being on guard against Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wooo, that was super embarrassing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter, did something happen to the town?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not really. It&rsquo;s because that Diablo guy has returned so the defense network has become stronger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the hell? Did you say that Diablo have come back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no way the plan to take over Farmus Kingdom is concluded that quickly&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never mind, right now the focus is on Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why did you come here for? You can screw off if you just came here to watch a show. Go back at this instant!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru, now you are just being mean&hellip; Don&rsquo;t worry, I was going to do some real business!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora hands out something seemingly with a sound effect of &ldquo;Chang&mdash;!&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the manga I prepared for him beforehand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora is holding the last volume.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is this for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t understand. As a result Veldora becomes indignant and begins to complain to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you play dumb now! The content doesn&rsquo;t match up with the cover! Are you trying to troll me by tantalizing me at such crucial (plot) point?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, AH&mdash;! I recall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was trying to prank him alright.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he acts nice then I&rsquo;ll give him the sequel. That&rsquo;s the prank with manga I wanted to try lecture him with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I accidentally left the entire manga series to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So did Veldora come all the way here to get the sequel&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All the way to this separated battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the addition of my ultimate skill &ldquo;Storm King Veldora&rdquo;, I would be able to summon him from &ldquo;Infinity Prison&rdquo;&hellip; But even without my call, Veldora came regardless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is another lesson for me today, but right now it matters not whether I&rsquo;ve learnt anything from it or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The town is guarded by Diablo now, since Veldora has come, I&rsquo;ll just use him to my advantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alight, before I give you the sequel, there is a request I want to make from you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? What is that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You go ahead and have some fun with Milim over there. But you must refrain from hurting her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milim? Oh, that&rsquo;s my brother&rsquo;s only daughter. It&rsquo;s my first time meeting her. I see she&rsquo;s still a child. Fine, I&rsquo;ll handle it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora agrees with alacrity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Does he want to read the sequel? Or does he have interest in Milim? Either is fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s only daughter&rdquo;&mdash;That line is somewhat discerning, but I&rsquo;ll include it in the meeting after this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim&rsquo;s eyes are carefully navigating our side, she also seems interested in Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes are glowing, so it should be fine now if I walk away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim vs Veldora, I wonder who is stronger. That&rsquo;s indeed intriguing, but at least Veldora is stronger than me, so he must be able to buy some time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t waste a good opportunity like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that I am free, I&rsquo;ve got to hurry and finish Clayman to end this fight once and for all.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now then&mdash;How did the situation develop when I was focused on dealing with Milim?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have very little worry for Veldora and Milim, and turned my eyes to Ranga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since he seems to have encountered the most challenge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ranga, are you alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh oh, Rimuru-sama. I am fine, just a bit troubled.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So there is indeed a situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was wondering why he seems to be restrained during his fight, it would seem that he has difficulty in using his skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the problem&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was about to ask Ranga when I discover the reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Help. Help me. Help me please!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s the weeping sounds of children. They are transmitted in forms of &ldquo;Thought&rdquo; from the Nine-Head Beast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">White Ape and Moon Rabbit were only trying to protect their scared master.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see, I will rescue you now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ranga, you focus on distracting the White Ape and the Moon Rabbit. Don&rsquo;t let them interfere with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ranga then focuses on pinning down the White Ape while the other two Tempest Wolves distract the Moon Rabbit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I instead move towards the Nine-Head Beast who&rsquo;s been demonstrating menace to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I approach the poor cub that&rsquo;s been controlled by Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Report. &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo; result shows&hellip;manipulation cursed spell. Remove spell? YES/NO&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time the curse spell is detected with ease and is successfully removed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be great if this was the same with the analysis on Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn&rsquo;t matter. As soon as I release the cursed bond, Nine-Head beast falls asleep out of exhaustion after a joyful howl. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s quite adorable with how much it resembles a smol animal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has three tails with blonde hair, the rest of its body resembles a cute little fox.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ranga on the side seems to spark a sense of competition upon seeing the scene. I mean, you also have cool and cute characters of your own. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Protect this child.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood, master.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I pat Ranga and hand over the little fox to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that settles with Ranga&rsquo;s opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I then turn to Beretta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has already finished his battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta seems delighted as he lies out all the special-grade weapons and armors in a line to polish them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi oi oi! What are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahh, Rimuru-sama is here. It&rsquo;s a shame that you didn&rsquo;t see me in action, but I&rsquo;ve prepared all these trophies for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta bows to me with respect while saying so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The trophies you mean&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The so-called finest work of Clayman, Piorra has been dismembered to the extent of miserable to look at. There also seem to be equipment that are gifts for Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have always guessed that Beretta is strong, but I didn&rsquo;t expect him to beat that arsenal looking Majin without a scratch&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And more importantly&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi, Beretta. This may sound pretty harsh, but you seem to have only picked up bad habits from Ramiris!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Woo!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta looks at me in shock, probably. His face is masked but I could tell from his aura.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have to give advice here. Or else Beretta will forever be tainted by Ramiris&rsquo; horrible habits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It may just be me thinking too much, but how do you plan to deal with all these trophies?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A-about that&hellip; I want to offer them to Rimuru-sama&hellip; I was wondering if by offering these things, you can then provide residence for me and Ramiris-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm? Providing residence&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris has indeed mentioned about wanting to move to our town, why is Beretta supporting her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why are you supporting the idea?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;It&rsquo;s because&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The content of Beretta&rsquo;s explanation is dumbfounding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just now he wanted to help us and was forced to pledge his loyalty to one master only by Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta mentioned then that he would be serving Ramiris full-heartedly after assisting me this time. But Beretta was still once a cunning Demon, so he has already come up with a backup plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Ramiris move to our town, he could then move along as well. If that&rsquo;s the case, he could then help us indirectly through Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These words are almost sophistry, yet he says it sounding very justified. His proud and smug look while saying so really resembles the style of a Demon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&hellip; Never mind, you truly are more and more like Ramiris!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a compliment, but I am still honored.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s not compliment at all!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seriously, it&rsquo;s only been a while since we last met yet he&rsquo;s become so much cheekier now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, that&rsquo;s quite the interesting growth style.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll discuss about this later. It won&rsquo;t be that easy to prepare a residence alone, I&rsquo;ll have to consider it more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes sir, I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Beretta accepted my proposition happily, so that concludes it for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll consider Beretta&rsquo;s proposition later. I turn around to look at the last person, Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right there, the result is about to be revealed.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is breathing heavily as he stares at Shion hatefully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem he has learnt how strong Shion is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be an understatement to say Clayman seems to have been getting draws from fighting Shion. That&rsquo;s because Shion has the incredible trump card of &ldquo;Super Regeneration&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their powers are on par yet Shion has the upper hand in terms of endurance. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The exchanges between the two seem to be equally matched, but Clayman already seemed tired as I was battling Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion would probably win even without my help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now Clayman must be anxious seeing Shion has the advantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that all you got? Aren&rsquo;t you too weak to call yourself a Demon Lord?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion sure is ruthless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s totaling despising Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;B-bastard, unforgivable! Go, Dancing Mannequin!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he finishes, Clayman releases five mannequins. They immediately turn into Majins and throw themselves towards Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every one of them is a Greater Majin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman has infused the souls of Majins he has collected with the mannequins in preparation of their immediate manipulation. They are his hidden combat forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s no time for him to reserve his forces, so he pulls out all his aces in a go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These forces are more than enough to defeat normal Majin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion pulls out her beloved odachi and slashes the five Majins in one hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How boring. You&rsquo;ve really got nothing interesting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She says so towards Clayman looking chilled as ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She sustained the battle without a scratch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion actually has more style of a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the contrary, Clayman begins to shiver and shouts with the expression of having been greatly shamed:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Q-quit joking around, you bastard! It&rsquo;s too early for you to get cocky! My Dancing Mannequins will restore themselves soon and attack you. Now we are doing things seriously!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is not being sour about losing, but there is really that kind of effect in play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion waits for it without a care, yet the Mannequins have no sign of getting up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is of course a reason for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-how can this&hellip; Why aren&rsquo;t they revived?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman mumbles to himself with anxiety in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His proud combat force has not gotten back to their feet, causing him to be confused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since that&rsquo;s the case, I shall explain things for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uhh&mdash;how troublesome, but I&rsquo;ll tell you. Shion&rsquo;s odachi can consume souls. Did you forget to apply defensive spells for the physical and spiritual resistance of your mannequins? If you are that crude in craftsmanship, of course they would get trashed in one slash.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s no point in hiding at this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was planning to eat Clayman anyway, so I&rsquo;ll tell what he wants to know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;T-this knife possesses spiritual attack!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing rare, even the humans are using them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-impossible! That&rsquo;s a rare power even among special-grade equipment!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah&mdash;right. They are knives made by my people anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve improved Shion&rsquo;s odachi greatly on basis of Hinata&rsquo;s sword. Now it can attack spiritual body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It isn&rsquo;t really consuming souls, but the knife is able to cause damage to spiritual life form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Depending on the power applied in her attack, those without resistive power would instantly die, nor does it have the limitation of seven hits. That&rsquo;s why there is no way to confirm whether the enemies are killed or not, but it won&rsquo;t be much of an issue considering Shion doesn&rsquo;t know how to hold back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, it is a combined heavy attack causing both physical and spiritual damages, so you won&rsquo;t even need seven hits to ensure the kill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, is that so? Then it would be &lsquo;Hercules&rsquo; Edge &middot; Ex&rsquo; </span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt42" id="ftnt_ref42">[42]</a></sup><span class="c1">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You didn&rsquo;t know&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Didn&rsquo;t I clarified when briefing with you? Never mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion really is too lazy to memorize such difficult mechanisms, so it was the right call to have improved its function.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go, gogogo, is that so? You are using the power of that knife to fight me. Then I should claim that annoying knife as well into my collection! Consume it, Superb Demon Lord Domination!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman seems to have misunderstood something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Creepy beams of black light begin to shoot out of Clayman&rsquo;s hands, and they wrap around Shion&rsquo;s body from bottom to top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion is doing nothing in response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ehh, you could have dodged that and then finish him off&hellip; Fine then, it doesn&rsquo;t seem necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman might have thought that Shion was too slow to react. He looks rather pleased at this sight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gogogogogo. You should be happy; this is the ultimate curse spell that can even control Demon Lords! It is quite the waste to use it against Majin like you, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;ll have to reorganize the Five Fingers anyway. Come be my subordinate and be of use to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is completely mistaken judging by his words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How pathetic, Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion is not rendered unable to move, it&rsquo;s simply that she doesn&rsquo;t want to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman has boasted this skill to the roof yet it has had no effect. But perhaps you guys (readers) don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s the case either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion has obtained the skill &ldquo;Perfect Memory&rdquo; that can store her memory in her astral body&mdash;In simpler terms, it is a special skill that can save memory even when the brain is damaged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as one retains his conscious soul and memory, he can be revived even when his body is completely damaged. She has become a special species. It won&rsquo;t be too much to call her a semi-spiritual life form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, she can think with her soul.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That means she has complete immunity against all mind control effects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Opponents against Shion have can&rsquo;t do anything with domination spells.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi, what are you trying to do with this? I don&rsquo;t even feel a thing, do I have to wait a little longer?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion asks impatiently as she has been wrapped around like a cocoon by the black silk. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve had this thought long ago&hellip; You should really change your pro-wrestler mindset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why would you intentionally fall into enemies&rsquo; trap in real battles&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether it is Shion, or Suphia or even Milim, I can&rsquo;t understand this mindset of a battle frenzy. Stop it, get some help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; explains that Shion is not affected by the skill, so it is unnecessary to be cautious against Clayman&rsquo;s secret technique.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-how could this be&hellip; Why is my Superb Demon Lord Denomination not working? Impossible, there is no such thing! That is the ultimate curse spell that can control even Demon lords!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is the spell that controlled the Nine-Head Beast. Indeed, it seems to be able to easily dominate Calamity-level beings, but shouldn&rsquo;t it be useless against Disaster-level Demon Lords?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This Clayman is too overconfident with his power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion then, probably bored of waiting, blows away the black cocoon in an instant with her Youki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How very boring. You don&rsquo;t deserve to be a Demon Lord when relying on such petit trickery.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion says so with much disdain in her tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing this, Clayman falls into panic. He freezes on the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;No, that&rsquo;s not true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion&rsquo;s words seem to have touch Clayman&rsquo;s nerve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gogogo, Gohahahaha&mdash;! How dare you say I don&rsquo;t deserve to be Demon Lord? Unforgivable, trash! I&rsquo;ll make you regret this; regret having forced me to use my real power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He begins to shake his shoulder and laughs out without any care. His laughter sounds desolate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He then begins to take off all his classy clothes, exposing his upper body. Clayman has secretly carried many gadgets and items, but he doesn&rsquo;t seem interested in using them and scattered them all over the place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as I thought that things are about to end, it turns out Clayman has kept a hand (four actually) up his sleeve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After exposing his upper body, two pairs of hands grow out of his back. Those hands look slim and long and are wrapped in black exoskeletons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s who he truly is&mdash;It is a completely different figure from his previous disguise, one that reeks an aura of insanity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, of course. Yes, Demon Lord. I am Demon Lord. That&rsquo;s why I care about how I fight. I send my enemies to their graves with elegance and grace. But that&rsquo;s enough. Enough. This feeling, I&rsquo;ve forgotten for too long&hellip; I&rsquo;ll crash you with my hands!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He roars with rage and reveals his true nature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is holding something, something precious looking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is a mask, a clown mask with the carving of a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He puts it on without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? Now you seem a bit more intrigued. You are beginning to impress me. I am Demon Lord Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s personal secretary Shion. Allow me to be your opponent!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion looks delighted and announces her name to Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman also&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Demon Lord&mdash;No, I am &lsquo;The Laughing Clown (Crazy Pierrot)&rsquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt43" id="ftnt_ref43">[43]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Clayman. I&rsquo;ll kill you, Majin Shion!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He responds by announcing his title.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s how they begin their fight at the same time.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman with his true self revealed is very strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As expected from a Demon Lord, he is approaching Shion with a strong mana. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His natural pair of hands are controlling those ominous black silk beams.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The upper pair of hands on his back hold an axe and a mace while the lower half holds a sword and a shield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is trying to give Shion a hard time with manipulation of both magical and physical attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Shion is stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She waves her odachi named &ldquo;Hercules&rsquo; Edge &middot; Ex&rdquo; to deflect Clayman&rsquo;s sword and smash through his shield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her straight swing from up to down also destroyed the defending axe and mace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All of this wild strength originates from Shion&rsquo;s unique skill</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt44" id="ftnt_ref44">[44]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;Demonification&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for her almost cheating effect of weapon destruction, it is probably due to &ldquo;Decisive Result&rdquo; and &ldquo;Optimal Action&rdquo; from (her skill) &ldquo;Chef&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, Clayman is no match against Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with his true strength, Clayman is still beaten to a pulp by Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two pairs of iron wrists crossed behind his back are defending against Shion&rsquo;s fists, yet those four hands have been broken. Shion was also able to score a punch right on Clayman&rsquo;s stomach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WOOOOOOOHHHHHHH&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman seems to be in great pain as he begins to foam from his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The result is set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I may sound like I&rsquo;m favoring my subordinate, but Shion has become super strong. She came back from death and obtained far greater strength than before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;GAPUUUUUUUUUU&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion gives Clayman another kick. He begins to spin on the ground with a depressed expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His mask is broken to reveal his bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Im&hellip;Impo&hellip;ssible&hellip;I-I don&rsquo;t believe. I&hellip;me&hellip;Demon Lord Clayman is&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He finally realizes the difference in strength with his opponent and couldn&rsquo;t accept such reality. Clayman seems out of his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, can I take his life?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion asks me now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">About that, though I still have some questions to ask, but I&rsquo;ve guessed about most of his answers. The only thing left is the identity of the man behind the scene, would he answer honestly though?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;D-damnit! Milim, what the hell is Milim doing? That type of trash, go ahead and defeat&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman seems to know his death is imminent and shout in panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the Milim in his words has been suppressed by Veldora. Suspecting at this point, Clayman looks at Veldora with eyes of witnessing unbelieving scenery&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-who are you&hellip;? W-What is this? What is with the incredible power&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that he has discovered that Veldora is no ordinary Majin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Although he may look human, he is actually Veldora. Didn&rsquo;t I just say we are friends?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is speechless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seems to be denying, but upon seeing how the opponent was able to put up a fight against Milim, he is forced to accept reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora has been fighting Milim until now with elegant fighting styles. In between there seem to be shouts of familiar technique names. Milim seems to be reacting quite surprisingly to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s making me question&mdash;whether she is really being manipulated?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&hellip;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have some doubts regarding Milim&rsquo;s reaction, but never mind, I&rsquo;ll leave her alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora seems to be having fun fighting in human form for the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is right then, Clayman gave up seeking help from Milim. In the midst of Chaos, he changes his plan to flee to the edge of the battle zone and begins to shout to the outside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;F-Frey! Frey, what are you doing? We are on the same boat here, come and help me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman begs for help with he can yet Frey&rsquo;s reaction is extremely cold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara, pardon me now, Clayman. I can&rsquo;t enter this &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; without Guy&rsquo;s permission. What a shame.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that, she gives such fake response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman smacks his lip unpleasantly and turns his head towards Milim again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His eyes twitch frequently as the last bit of sanity within him ceases to exist&mdash;he has gone completely mad. It would seem Clayman has come up with some bad idea again. With a crazy smile on his face, his eyes fall on Milim once more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Goha-GOHAHAHAHA! Milim, oh Milim! Hear my command and activate &lsquo;Frenzy Berserk&rsquo; ! Go and kill all of these people!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He spills out such frantic words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is no longer caring about his image, he only wishes to live.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh shit, now we are done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t just sit around and watch anymore. I need to join the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet it is then I heard some unbelievable words coming into my ears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why would I do that? Rimuru and them are all my friends!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I turn back in shock and see Milim smirking and chilling there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milim! Wait, aren&rsquo;t you being controlled&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHA&mdash;HAHAHA! You seem to have been fooled all this time, Rimuru! How could I be controlled by Clayman?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">N-NANI?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&hellip;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For some reason, &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; started to sound quite angry from just now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I&rsquo;ll ignore it for now, Milim is the focus here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, are you not controlled by Clayman?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eh&mdash;What in the world is going on? I unconsciously tried to double check. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, Milim only gives me a proud smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am not the only person who&rsquo;s confused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the Demon Lord also said in surprise: &ldquo;Eh? Wasn&rsquo;t she just hit, why didn&rsquo;t she react at all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person most surprised is no more than Clayman himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;R-right. &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo; gave me the &lsquo;Dominating Orb&rsquo;. It should make you listen to my every order&hellip; did you not kill Karion according to my order?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah&mdash;nice one Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is too shocked to the point the of not realizing what he is saying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now the credibility of my evidence footage has also increased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because not only did Clayman just confess to his crime accidentally, he also exposed that there is someone behind all these.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim responds to him with the following:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s it! I wanted to ask about it. Answer me, Clayman. Who exactly is &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She questions sharply without a care. She also completely ignores Clayman&rsquo;s question, that seems like what Milim would do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If this is the case, it would mean that Milim was never controlled in the first place, and instead has been suspicious towards Clayman from the start.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, why?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before my question could have been answered, another voice arrives to interrupt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi oi oi, who did you say has died?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the opposite side of the isolated battle zone, a low and charming voice raises its volume.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is from Demon Lord Frey&rsquo;s servant, the man with the giant eagle wings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hold on a second, could this be&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He really did wear such flawed disguise&mdash;! </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now wouldn&rsquo;t that make me the one who didn&rsquo;t realize about it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&hellip;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; seems dumbfounded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of that. Back then &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; seems to want to say something&hellip; No, I must be thinking too much. Yeah, I&rsquo;m definitely thinking too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s forget about this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I need to be more perceptive in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s how I would do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That man&mdash;Karion slowly takes off his mask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His incredible aura instantly leaks out in its full.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion activates his aura and restore his original appearance in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lion King (Beast Master)&rdquo; Karion &mdash; The real deal, there is no way around it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Glad to have you back safe and well, Karion-san.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Rimuru. I&rsquo;m not exactly safe and well, but that doesn&#39;t matter. Thanks for taking care of my subordinates.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are welcome.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion expresses thanks to me and gives off a smile to Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I can confirm that Milim was never controlled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, how could this&hellip; It would mean, did you really&hellip;? But Frey said&hellip; Oh, so Frey was in it too. Even you betrayed me&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that he has cleared up the story, Clayman stares his eyes at Frey like a madman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Frey doesn&rsquo;t seem to care one bit.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 646.50px; height: 890.28px;"><img alt="" src="images/image15.png" style="width: 646.50px; height: 890.28px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Considering the situation, rather to say she&rsquo;s betrayed Clayman, it&rsquo;s more like she&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara? Have you been mistaken all these time about me being your partner?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey says so coldly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, indeed. Women are horrifying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes indeed, Frey has been lying to Clayman from start to end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Q-quit&hellip;joking around! Y-you people&hellip; Unforgivable, I won&rsquo;t let you walk free!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, the howling of the sad clown echoes around the room&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shion, do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I give the order and Shion takes action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She has been like a starving hound under the order of &ldquo;Freeze!&rdquo;. Now she has grasped her knife tight to swing it at Clayman with all her strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is going to execute him with the slash of her odachi.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman applies all his defense, yet all three pairs of his hands are severed. He has sustained grave injuries after being slashed open sideway. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion&rsquo;s odachi can even destroy one&rsquo;s spirit. That slash put Clayman down to the ground without a sound afterward.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right, now Clayman is out of the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion is still alive, so my testimonies are all set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I won&rsquo;t be treated as enemy by the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is on the verge of dying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He isn&rsquo;t posing any threat and is impossible to come up with any plan to reverse his situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The evidences to his crime are all confirmed, now he can&rsquo;t walk free with excuses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because he has openly confessed in front of the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the Demon Lords witnessing all these, they will judge for themselves, yet Clayman has lost all credibility. Now there won&rsquo;t be any Demon Lord trying to defend him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;Barrier&rdquo; separating the battle zone has been deactivated. Frey walks towards us and then turns straight towards Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I trusted that you won&rsquo;t be manipulated, but I was still quite nervous, Milim. But you have followed through our &ldquo;promise&rdquo;, thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHAHAHA! Of course I will since we are friends. Right, Frey, have you kept good care of that thing and brought it here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I did, are you referring to this? Speaking of which, you are even immune towards the dominating orb, you are truly strong&hellip; &ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two continued to exchange as Frey takes out something from her pocket to hand to Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s the Dragon Knuckle I gifted her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim seems delighted and takes the thing as she couldn&rsquo;t wait to put them on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And a smile blooms on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim and Frey&rsquo;s interactions have all been observed by the Demon Lords. After seeing all these, they&rsquo;ve finally been brought updated to the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that was all an act.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-I saw through it from the start!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I guessed things should be.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how it was&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, I overheard many conversations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I shouldn&rsquo;t be the only one who was fooled by Milim, yet in the end everyone acts as if they&rsquo;ve known long ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just then, I heard a moan in pain near my foot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;F-from when? How long have you deceived me&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem he&rsquo;s still struggling to grasp his last breath. He couldn&rsquo;t believe this. It was unacceptable to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim reveals the cruel truth to Clayman on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, I worked really hard! I made a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; with Frey to pretend being tricked. And I put on the wristband to mislead you into thinking you&rsquo;ve controlled me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Q-quit joking around&hellip; That was the Dominating Orb infused with all of my mana&hellip;highest level&hellip;most powerful domination curse spell&hellip;! And how could you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm! I could resist most of those magics. I deactivated most of my barriers and force myself with my own will to give up resisting&hellip; I know you are cautious enough to not believe the curse spell has worked until you see it with your eyes. I was able to make it through in that way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-What did you&hellip;say? You&hellip;you let others intentionally cast a curse on you. And even with my highest-level magic item&hellip; my ultimate technique that can even dominate Demon Lords&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? But it would be impossible to dominate me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim raises her chest and brags looking all proud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously, you made me really worried. By the way, your acting was so poor with how you held your fist in the victory pose with smile on your face.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t blame me for that. I was really happy seeing Rimuru being angry for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey shrugs seeing Milim like this. Then she recalls something and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I was so nervous when Clayman beat Milim initially. If Milim had not endured, my home would definitely be destroyed. Your forbearance skill is top notch. That is commendable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She exposes this regarding the whole incident.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So Clayman has beaten Milim more than once. He has hit her more before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t believe such person even exist, is he trying to commit suicide?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm! Because I am already an adult. An adult who knows how to tolerate!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She emphasizes on the word adult, but she&rsquo;s still just a kid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way. Never mind, I won&rsquo;t go after you for it. Besides, did you really endure it just for our agreement? What was your real intention?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? Nothing really. I just recalled the weird things Clayman said before. He wanted to make Rimuru into an enemy of the humans and plan a war between human and monster. It won&rsquo;t be fun to let him succeed, that&rsquo;s why I had to interfere!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t expect that you would stand out like this for once&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHAHAHAHA! That&rsquo;s right! I am already an adult!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right right right. I&rsquo;ll take your words for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s how it was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim&rsquo;s sharp instinct has made her notice the people behind that manipulates Clayman. Did she pretend to be manipulated in order to find out the real identity of that person?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seems to also have made some sort of a deal with Frey; I suppose I&rsquo;ll let the whole deal of fooling me pass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From this I can conclude that Milim has never once been brainwashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not that the effect has been deactivated midway through, it has never worked in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of these have been an act. It&rsquo;s all because Milim was too good at her performance, we can crown her the best actress.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she even went to the extent of secretly eating pepper in private to maintain her emotionless expression. She has fooled everyone with her natural expression while enduring the horrible taste (of pepper). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora has seen through her with one glance and played along Milim. He says that he wanted to get familiar with his new body, so he had some fun fighting with Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora seems to have surprisingly high adaptability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Have you not noticed all these this whole time, Raphael-san?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&hellip;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that I think about it, it&rsquo;s been trying to say something all this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raphael-san said that there was no result, now that I think about it, it makes perfect sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since she was never under the control of any spell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I misunderstood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I need to listen more carefully to other people&rsquo;s explanation in the future. I&rsquo;d better form another habit of listening other people&rsquo;s words till they finish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I reflect secretly on the incident.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Karion comes and stands before Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, Milim, is it alright for me to ask you something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? Sure, ask away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim answers with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is in a good mood with her Dragon Knuckles back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a big deal but I want to confirm something&hellip; Were you really not controlled? Does that mean that you were having fun trolling me as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion is putting up a smile as veins pop on his forehead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm, of course he would mind that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Woo! A-about that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahh, don&rsquo;t be so nervous. It&rsquo;s okay. It was because I was too weak. But you did trash my country, was that your idea as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion didn&rsquo;t even try to hide his anger and asks Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For an instant, Milim panicked, but&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh! Karion, does such insignificant business really matter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She got mad at him instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing this, you know for sure it is Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Insignificant my ass! Seriously, if you had slipped your hands, I would have died!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh, annoying, you are so annoying! That&rsquo;s because I was acting too&mdash;no, because I was acting so hard to trick Clayman ? That&rsquo;s why it was all Clayman&rsquo;s fault!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi oi oi, don&rsquo;t push all the blame to Clayman now&hellip; Enough. You won&rsquo;t listen anyway if I complain to you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I feel much sympathy for Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Karion&rsquo;s manly face now shed with tears, I have the impulse to go comfort him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was tricked too, so I can understand how he feels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sad, Karion-san. The Beastketeers and the rest are all fine and was able to avenge you. They all worked very hard this time. So things are not all bad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh oh, Rimuru. Sorry I had to trouble you to comfort me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry. Besides, you can always rebuild your castle. In order to rebuild it, I&rsquo;ve taken captives of Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates and will let those Majins do the work for you guys.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah? Oi oi oi, is it true&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course it is. We also won&rsquo;t hold back any of our technical support. And assistance is only natural. That&rsquo;s why, let us work together to build a more prestigious, more comfortable kingdom!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have time on our side. I&rsquo;ve also got a bunch of money from Clayman. I was thinking to use it for future trading, right now it would be a good strategy to give out a few favors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was also thinking to build a good relationship through this operation with our neighboring Beastmen. Allow me to use this opportunity well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHA&mdash;HAHAHA! That&rsquo;s wonderful, Karion. I have also contributed to it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How did Milim contribute to it at all?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If anything, her contribution is to have wiped out the entire place clean without bricks and stone so the construction work could be conducted more easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My apologies for the trouble, but we are saved! Rimuru&mdash;I should call you Rimuru-san. I swear that us Beast Kingdom will maintain a friendly relationship with your country forever, and we will provide you with any assistance!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion was surprised and spoke with gratitude on his face. Then he turns back to Milim and warned her along: &ldquo;I hope you could reflect about all this.&rdquo; Milim seems to sense that things have been resolved smoothly and has turned back to her old self.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Should I call her a realist? Never mind, that&rsquo;s more like Milim anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyhow, Karion has regained his spirit, so I&rsquo;ll let things slide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, it would seem there are more people who are surprised by my words. The Demon Lords surrounding us are also surprised at my speech.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe there is something like this in life. You let those Majins live, aren&rsquo;t you just too naive&hellip; But it&rsquo;s an interesting thought, nonetheless. No wonder Noir decided to serve you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Red-Haired Guy says so delightfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Noir</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a></sup><span class="c1">? What the hell is that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never mind that, I would put aside it to check on Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Neh, Clayman. You have been arrogant against the weak and those who can&rsquo;t resist. I don&rsquo;t think you are qualified as a Demon Lord. I didn&rsquo;t interfere because Milim has endured this whole time&hellip; But even I am a little pissed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey lashes out at him coldly and says so. It means she doesn&rsquo;t plan on saving Clayman, the equivalent of giving him the death sentence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Even though this is the natural rule of the survival of the fittest, but Clayman, you really crossed the line this time. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of complaints now that my country has been destroyed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion as well, he is angry at the fact that his country has been bombarded. Even though the one who did it was Milim, he seems to be pushing the responsibility onto Clayman. He doesn&rsquo;t plan to forgive him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy is only watching the show from the side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rest of the Demon Lords as well, they aren&rsquo;t objecting the punishment towards Clayman. It would seem none of the Demon Lords are in favor of Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then the whole thing is now settled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What follows it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Clean up job&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman&rsquo;s death is near.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman knows he won&rsquo;t live for long and is troubled by thoughts of regret that have filled his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then he recalls his comrades&rsquo; words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those words swing around his heart like trotting lamps</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;You&rsquo;ve got to be careful&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Ah ah&hellip; Laplace, you were right&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He thought he was cautious enough already, yet he has been blinded by power all these times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has mistaken Milim&rsquo;s incredible power that he witnessed as something of his own. This has led to the situation now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Just as you thought, from the result now, I&rsquo;ve been played in Milim&rsquo;s palm this whole time. I thought I took every step with caution&hellip; Yet I was played by Milim. You guys gave me the seat of Demon Lord because of trust, yet I could only make it to today&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he ignored his friends&rsquo; advice, he was already destined to end up in this fate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such thoughts keep revolving in Clayman&rsquo;s head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Clayman, you are not as strong as us, don&rsquo;t you go act all stubborn on your own!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;He&mdash;Hehehe. Tear is right. Come and find us if you need help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Ah ah, Tear. Ah ah, Footman. Yeah. I forgot to&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has always placed his dignity with too much importance and never wanted to rely on his companions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, he has always relied on his companions, yet he threw that idea behind his head at such crucial point of time. That was really uncalled for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">I wanted to become strong just like you guys. Shouldn&rsquo;t it be natural to be stubborn and strike for it? Because I am a member of the Moderate Clown Troupe after all&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman hopes to receive recognition from his companions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hopes they would recognize his power, that&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t involve the Moderate Clown Troupe to his schemes. It was truly Clayman&rsquo;s miscalculation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it is all too late&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;He recalls the first time he met &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, are you Clayman?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who are you? How dare you call my name like that; do you have a death wish?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi oi oi, you don&rsquo;t have to raise your guard like that. I got here because of someone&rsquo;s recommendation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Recommendation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. The one recommending was your boss, Demon Lord Kazaream.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman was planning to kill this young man, yet he has called out a memorable name&mdash;Kazaream. That&rsquo;s when Clayman began to have interest in hearing the young man to speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then he learnt something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He learnt his ambition and his abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;That&rsquo;s how it is. I must control this world. Come and assist me in doing so, Clayman?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He-hehahahaha. Interesting, is this perhaps a request?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. A request for the &lsquo;Moderate Clown Troupe&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And the reward?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To revive Demon Lord Kazaream, how about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This reward is more than he could ask for, so there was no reason to turn it down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He knew what the young man is capable of and recognized the plan to be feasible. There was nothing to doubt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman made up his mind then to take on the contract.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know you will take it. Let us collaborate in taking this world into our pocket. When the time comes, we can all live in this world happily ever after!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo; wishing to turn the world into a game to enjoy its fun, Clayman believes such idea may come true one day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They must overcome layers of obstacles. But it is precisely because of that this task seemed so fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He thought so originally, yet now his misstep has costed the entire plan to foil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was rare already that the reward has been paid&mdash;Demon Lord Kazaream was successfully revived&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">My carelessness has led things to this point today. Then, I won&rsquo;t even have ground to excuse myself&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kazaream went through all the trouble to be revived, yet Clayman couldn&rsquo;t even find a chance to congratulate him now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is all his own doing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was ordered to stay put, yet Clayman has acted on his own and ignored the order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At last, he thought of that man&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The wise words from Clayman&rsquo;s respected and beloved Demon Lord Kazaream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Clayman. You and I are a lot like each other, so it&rsquo;s fine to set me as your model, but never ever inherit my shortcomings as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He should have thought about that long ago. That was the motto he deemed as truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Ah ah&hellip; Kazaream-sama&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ve forgotten your advice and made the fatal misstep&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, Clayman has taken the wrong move and made the worst choices.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like Demon Lord Kazaream, he has lost to a new Demon Lord, inherited his trait of doing stupid things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is karma.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is the miscalculation that Clayman hated the most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">I couldn&rsquo;t even save the army you lent me, I&rsquo;ve lost them because of my miscalculation&hellip; I can&rsquo;t die, not just yet. I won&rsquo;t forgive myself to die without any legacy like this&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As things have progressed, he at least needs to spread out the intelligences he gathered from his enemies. This has prompted an idea to rise in the heart of the desperate and almost given up Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;You the Undead Elf created through my body, but I&rsquo;ve done the most work on your head. Unlike Footman and Tear, you are not suitable for combat. However, you are the only one who would take the role of strategizing and commanding the army. That&rsquo;s why Clayman, you should be the Demon Lord&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has let down Demon Lord Kazaream&rsquo;s expectation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he didn&rsquo;t have enough power, he would only need to acquire it. Then, he would be on the same ground with Footman and Tear. No, he would surpass them in strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once Clayman who&rsquo;s quick in the head acquires power, he would excel more than them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c13">Right, that&rsquo;s it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I can&rsquo;t awake to become True Demon Lord. That&rsquo;s why, please grant me power. Grant me power&hellip; Grant me the invincible power&mdash;&mdash;!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Confirmed. Transforming souls to magicule&hellip;Successful. Beginning decomposition to produce vessel of flesh, reconstructing&mdash;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman didn&rsquo;t expect his wish to come true. Yet the &ldquo;Voice of the World&rdquo; has answered to Clayman&rsquo;s request.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under such desperate circumstance, Clayman&rsquo;s wishes came true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">God (Veldanava kek) has not forsaken me!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman has already answered himself in heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">&mdash;Go-gogogo&hellip; These people have always looked down on me, I&rsquo;ll have them pay for it. But, right now no matter how I need to get out&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though Clayman has weakened to the point of not capable of making sounds, his spirit still possesses a fighting will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is the bright flame that is the fire of life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even so&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Opposite to how he thinks, Clayman has remained calm and decided to retreat from the location first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are several ancient Demon Lords here, and among them Guy, Milim and Dagruel are the most difficult to deal with. He won&rsquo;t be able to best them after just awakening, so it&rsquo;s more important for him to act cautiously now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To report to &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo;&mdash;That&rsquo;s his priority.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has previously underestimated the power of the Slime, and his Majin subordinate alone was stronger than Clayman. Not only so, he has also forged a friendship with the revived Veldora. This along cannot be overlooked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It couldn&rsquo;t have been a coincidence that he was able to survive the duel with that Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He must throw away his own opinions and analyze calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why Clayman has decided to retreat with this information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has drafted his plan with the condition of retrieving this intel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would use all his power to launch a Giant Magic Missile and flee during the chaotic situation created by the magic missile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Must be careful about Guy, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy is not interested in the weak, that&rsquo;s why Clayman thinks he won&rsquo;t care about himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">&mdash;It&rsquo;s alright, I can make it out of here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman makes such judgement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would even benefit more if the missile is to affect the surrounding crowds&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With these thoughts, Clayman climbs up.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under the gazes of all the Demon Lords, I was probably the first one to notice his movement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since I have been keeping my guard and staring at Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Get away from there now, Shion!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She immediately reacts to my order and backs up to my side. Quickly afterward, the location Shion stood on was affected as a giant magicule storm begins to swirl around Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The storm has been absorbing more magicule from the surrounding towards Clayman. Had I given the order a little later, Shion would have suffered its damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look like he&rsquo;s getting serious now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama? What is going on&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion asks me immediately, but she seems reassured seeing I am composed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is nothing to be panicked about, but even though I won&rsquo;t panic&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Clayman has awakened. Just as I predicted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is really just as you have predicted, then I am reassured!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion completely trusts me, but I still feel somewhat uneased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything is moving according to the plan of &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is it really okay? It would be embarrassing if I lose at this point&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I initially saw Clayman, I saw a group of evil objects chasing behind his soul.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those things may be called the spirits of resentment. Clayman has killed many people to this day, those are the remains of their souls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They have not merged with Clayman. They won&rsquo;t ascend to heaven nor will they dissipate into the atmosphere. Even with Clayman killed, they would only disappear along with him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was thinking about how to utilize them when &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; proposed an attack plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is to push Clayman into a desperate spot and catalyze his awakening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Proposal. Utilize &ldquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rdquo; to &ldquo;Prey&rdquo; on Clayman&rsquo;s awaken power. This can make up for the consumed magicule.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; said it as if it&rsquo;s so easy, yet there are many problems hindering it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s uncertain whether Clayman would indeed awaken or not. But he would definitely become stronger after awakening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, about that? Would Clayman fall asleep as he begins to evolve into Demon Lord?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. Clayman&rsquo;s evolution was not achieved through proper procedures, he is able to achieve complete evolution. Thus, predict he will not enter a state of dormancy.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would seem that its prediction of Clayman&rsquo;s increase in strength would be limited. But regardless I would need to beat the awakened Clayman anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to the prediction of &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo;, no matter how strong is Clayman becomes, I would still easily defeat him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The strength of the body, acquired power, and possible acquired skills&mdash;With all of these taken into the simulation to produce prediction and with his threat level set to the highest, &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; still arrives at the result that I would be the winner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s no use worrying, I have to confront him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Besides, it is true as well that my magicule is about to drain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reload speed of my speed is super-fast as well and I can instantly replenish myself after a large-scale magic spell. But honestly, it&rsquo;s still a long way from filling my mana full.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so I&rsquo;ve still got more mana than that before my awakening, yet without my notice I&rsquo;ve been using up the fuel tank provided by Veldora. Of course then I would want to replenish my magicule.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, I want to demonstrate to the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am the newcomer; I have to win the throne of Demon Lord with my own strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can only gain the approval of the Demon Lords by demonstrating my power like this, so there may be less trouble in the future. In order to prevent any other Demon Lords to mess with me, it is best to have them be on guard against me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to prevent further trouble in the future, I&rsquo;ll use the awakened Clayman to demonstrate my strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With my power&mdash;Ultimate skill &ldquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi, Rimuru! Did you say Clayman has awakened? Although it&rsquo;s unbelievable, but that power is truly incredible. Let me to assist you now&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, Karion-san. I&rsquo;ll deal with this guy. I&rsquo;ve claimed myself to be a Demon Lord, I want to get my position with my own strength. I&rsquo;m going to eliminate this guy to gain the approval of everyone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With my words, Karion has to step back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose to him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He cheers for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I won&rsquo;t lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My only motivation now is to take down my enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, I am the angriest person here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Come on, Clayman. Let us see who&rsquo;s stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, Clayman climbs up as I walk in front him myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other Demon Lords seem to decide to continue to observe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone seems fine with me fighting alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right, they must have made no objection hoping to see my true strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim laughs delightfully while Ramiris doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about the situation. Both probably thinks I won&rsquo;t lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll consider them to be confident in me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shion, Ranga, step back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I wish you emerge victorious in your conquest, Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Demon Lords take a step back along with Shion and the rest. Now this won&rsquo;t affect the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing that there is only me left, Clayman shows a small smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe-HEHAHAHAHAHA&mdash;! See, I&rsquo;ve got the power! How dare you be so cocky you trash! Now, it&rsquo;s my turn. I&rsquo;m gonna crash you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His laughter turns into guffaw as he looks at me with disdain. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he&rsquo;s only putting on an act.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sad thing is, Clayman&rsquo;s actions have all been predicted by &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; mentioned, it has predicted the two possible actions Clayman may take.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would either charge at me to kill me without the fear of death, or he can pretend to look down on me with the hope of distracting me and escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is clearly the latter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why Clayman would probably take the actions of&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His words are full of frivolousness, yet his eyes show cautiousness. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is trying to find any of my opening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve decided to play along with him as his ploy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I just say? You have nowhere to run. I am stronger than you. Give up your struggle and tell me the identity of the person giving the command behind you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is me acting, but my truthful words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps because of my sincerity, Clayman took the bait without a doubt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, how arrogant of you indeed. Let me show you my power&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman continues his act smoothly and suddenly decides to take action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Believing that I&rsquo;ve let down my guard, he launches a Giant Magic Missile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He must have accumulated that during our conversation. He has infused all of his power after awakening and fire the incredibly powerful Giant Magic Missile at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman predicts that I would dodge it. He may even have made other predictions, believing I would use my attack to counter the magic missile, but he probably thinks that it is impossible to stop a magic missile that&rsquo;s suddenly launched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I dodge the attack, he would then activate the explosive missile mid-air. If I come up with a way to counter it, he would also be able to escape during the explosion of the magic missile&mdash;That&rsquo;s likely how Clayman has planned his great scheme.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">*smacks lips* What a shame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you that you are done. This type of attack is useless. Projectile attack won&rsquo;t hurt me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I activate &ldquo;Gluttonous King Beelzeebuth&rdquo; and &ldquo;Prey&rdquo; at Clayman&rsquo;s Gigantic Magic Missile alongside the surrounding space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that it won&rsquo;t even affect the surrounding. Clayman&rsquo;s plan has been completely destroyed by me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Nani!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is both shocked and confused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with the interval I snap my finger to produce a clear sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In an instant, a wall of &ldquo;Barrier&rdquo; emerges to separate me and Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is now an isolated battle zone. I borrowed it from Guy&rsquo;s construction spell to recreate one.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 645.77px; height: 906.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image16.png" style="width: 645.77px; height: 906.50px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How dare he steal my technique, what a shameless guy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy mumbles so while looking intrigued, it&rsquo;s great that he doesn&rsquo;t seem mad about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I can eat Clayman with much reassurance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My conscience would probably feel bad having such idea. With these ideas, I seem to be adapting a mindset more and more akin to the bad guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is it because I am a monster that I&rsquo;m not against eating Clayman?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or could it be because I&rsquo;ve become a Demon Lord?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never mind, anything goes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-What is this? What is happening&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman cannot hide his shock in mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The attack he prides on vanished in an instant, his mind probably couldn&rsquo;t even process that in time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I&rsquo;ve told you several times, you are done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When you tried to fight against me with your level of strength, the result has already been set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How much power do I have and how much does my opponent have, it is very important for one to recognize that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi, if you want to show your true power then be quick about it. I&rsquo;ll wait. Or perhaps, are you planning to fool around and flee away with that attack just now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I ask despite knowing the answer myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Humans are horrible. But since I&rsquo;m slime and not human, so it won&rsquo;t matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Compared to that, Clayman is still underestimating me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has kept guard against me, but it&rsquo;s not enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; predicted, Clayman&rsquo;s awakening is not that good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His magicule has increased by a lot, but that&rsquo;s about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hasn&rsquo;t mastered the mana to control the magicule nor did he acquire any applicable skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though he seems to have awakened, his condition compared to me is still earth and heaven.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can accelerate my perception speed a million times more with &ldquo;Thought Acceleration&rdquo; and the time seems to have frozen. I could also build my spell under this condition so any magic would be activated right after the thought of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although it would be very inefficient to be applied for Magic Missile that requires the gathering of Youki around me, that&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t utilize it under such circumstance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s unlike the construction of spell that relies on consciousness&mdash;that is information. The gathering of Youki would cost some time, but it is only natural.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, that&rsquo;s because I have &ldquo;Chant Exemption&rdquo; and &ldquo;All of All&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt47" id="ftnt_ref47">[47]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how long the magic would take to launch, the million-time extended body sensation of time would always help cast the magic instantly. After all, a second under the skill is equal to two hundred and seventy-seven hours.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how large the scale is the spell, it would not cost more than a day, so any spell I cast wouldn&rsquo;t cost more than zero point one second to come in effect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for normal magic, it would be a piece of cake to cast several spells at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why, if I am Clayman, I would have cast several different magics to cause chaos at the scene before utilizing the chance to escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman did not resort to this reflects that his power is insufficient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t even notice that I&rsquo;ve set up the isolated battle zone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that Clayman&rsquo;s escape route has been cut by me, he will have to defeat me before he could escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not sure if he has sensed the bad situation he is in, but his aura begins to alter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He-HEHEHE, a miserable slime, how arrogant. You are indeed strong, I&rsquo;ll admit it. But this is not all my power!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He charges towards me without a care&mdash;a change of plan to walk the other path we predicted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has given up escaping and decided to showcase his own abilities in front of the other Demon Lords. It&rsquo;s a gamble with a low rate of win. To the Demon Lords &ldquo;Power is everything.&rdquo;, it would be possible for them to forgive his crime if he is strong enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But first, he needs to defeat me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You seem quite confident in your control of Youki, but will you be able to take this? Eat this, my strongest ultimate! Dragon Pulse Death Canon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Clayman has spoken a lot to distract me while trying to manipulate the pulse of earth</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt48" id="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and surrounded network around me and release them all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Youki gathered around the ground with the addition of his own magicule allows the pulse of earth to be transformed into beams of disturbance effect to attack the enemy&mdash;This is the principle of Dragon Pulse Death Canon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whoever affected by the skill would have their sequence of magicule disturbed and cause internal damages. It is immune to physical defense and it may even shoot through and destroy &ldquo;Barrier&rdquo; that is formed by magicule. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is a surge of power that can be called the monster Buster, truly something worthy of the style of Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it won&rsquo;t work on me at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I shall consume them all, &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beams projected from Dragon Pulse Death Canon rises from the ground like a flying dragon. However, now these dragons seem to be howling in dismay before their death as they are being absorbed into a twisted space before they could even reach me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Impossible to escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The scenery is as if they have encountered the gravitational force of a black hole that even light cannot escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Clayman. You are weaker than me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I must break his psyche.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this way, he may give out the man behind the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fear is the best weapon to break one&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Impossible&hellip;How can this be possible&mdash;&mdash;! That was m-my ultimate technique!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not important whether it is your ultimate technique or not, because projectile attacks won&rsquo;t work on me. If he puts in more thoughts and attacks me head-on, it may be a different case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now do you know that you have no chance to win? Then I&rsquo;ll ask you something. Give me all the information you have and give me the names of your helpers. If you confess honestly, I&rsquo;ll give you a quicker death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;HEHAHAHAHA! I am an undead elf, I&rsquo;ll revive even if I am killed by you today, I&rsquo;ll just find another day to kill you&mdash;OUCH!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I start to hit him with my hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I continuously hit him hard without a word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time, I apply &ldquo;Thought Acceleration&rdquo; on Clayman and accelerated his mind a million times more. My &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; not only would contribute to me, it can also affect other people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In terms of the time in the real world, it has only been a few seconds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But to Clayman, his sensation has lasted for dozens of days, filled with the taste of fear and pain of being continuously beaten by others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He needs to remember this fear and pain with his soul.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few more seconds pass on&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman&rsquo;s hair has fallen off due to fear, his face turns to one that resembles a ghoul.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Clayman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I call him calmly. And Clayman suddenly shakes and his entire body freezes out of fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you one more time. Who leaked the message to you? What&rsquo;s his relationship with you? Tell me and I&rsquo;ll give you a quick one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although I&rsquo;ve asked, Clayman turns out to be more tenacious than I expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;D-don&rsquo;t underestimate me. I won&rsquo;t betray my companions, nor will I sell out my contractor. T-this is the iron law of &lsquo;Moderate Clown Troupe&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is that so? So even the villains have their principles and that is non-negotiable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so, then don&rsquo;t blame me. Yeah, I&rsquo;ll let you in on this, you are not going to revive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I say so to Clayman as if it&rsquo;s nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was shouting about getting revived, but it would be impossible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once you are eaten by my &ldquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rdquo;, you will end up in a worse fate than being trapped in the &ldquo;Infinity Prison&rdquo; that even Veldora can&rsquo;t escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-What? What the hell are you talking about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could it be that he has been so stubborn because he still has hope of being revived?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing my words, Clayman panicked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You just said it. Didn&rsquo;t you say undead elf would revive even after death. That&rsquo;s why you want me to kill you so you can escape by releasing your astral body. Am I right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This guy is really cunning, and it&rsquo;s impressive how he would resort to anything in order to achieve his goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman&rsquo;s face suddenly turns blue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;W-What are you saying?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He tries his hardest to play dumb, but that simply confirms my doubt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t even need &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo; to spot such a thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, Raphael-san is indeed strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, you can attach your astral body with the pulse of earth to preserve your consciousness and memory, am I right? That&rsquo;s why you won&rsquo;t really die even with your body destroyed. That&rsquo;s why you want to fake your death&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see, so that&rsquo;s how it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I directly read out the explanation of &ldquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rdquo;. Clayman begins to shiver as a result, it seems that I&rsquo;ve guessed right on the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-wait&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that I know the reason behind it, it&rsquo;s about time to finish this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, it seems I won&rsquo;t be able to get more information by questioning him. I&rsquo;m going to execute Clayman now. Is there any objection? If you want to object, I can take on you for a round!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I ignore Clayman who wants to say something and ask the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be problematic if someone objects, but there is probably none.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do what you wish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As expected, Guy spoke on behalf of everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other Demon Lords seem to be fine with it as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stop! Don&rsquo;t do this, STOP IT&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman begins to shout like a madman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has realized at this point that he can&rsquo;t escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a big mess for me, that pisses me off. Don&rsquo;t you think you are getting a quick death now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, I place my hand on Clayman&rsquo;s head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he is willing to give me the identity of the man behind all these, I was going to give him a quick one. But Clayman didn&rsquo;t talk. In the long term, I need that information, but I suppose it&rsquo;s fine if I don&rsquo;t get it now, I&rsquo;ll see to it in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps Clayman has hidden some clues in his castle. I&rsquo;ve heard from witness that &ldquo;Moderate Clown Troupes&rdquo; are not all Majins, they are clearly collaborating with humans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now I don&rsquo;t know whether it is Eastern Empire or the Western Nations. Either side is fine. Since they know my movement, they must also have eyes in the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Slowly and surely, I would catch on their tail. If I get testimony that cannot be verified from Clayman, it may do the opposite effect and mess with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why, Clayman&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;There&rsquo;s still a little more time before your soul is destroyed completely. Before that, you should take you time to reflect.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c26">NO! HEY, STOP IT! DON&rsquo;T DO THIS! STOP IT&mdash;! H-HELP ME, FOOTMAN! HELP ME, TEAR! I CAN&rsquo;T DIE YET. CAN&rsquo;T DIE HERE&mdash;&mdash;!</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman seems to still be looking for ways to escape, he looks rather embarrassing like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, I won&rsquo;t let him go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter what he does now, I won&rsquo;t be moved. Letting someone like him go would be burying seed of catastrophe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, thanks to you, I&rsquo;m not that naive anymore. I&rsquo;m not gonna lose my companion again because of my naive ideas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c26">P-PLEASE HELP ME, KAZARAEM-SAMA&mdash;</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman reaches towards his broken mask, hold onto it and pray&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shua&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman with his ugly shouting, his struggle and resistance suddenly disappear in front of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has been consumed by my &ldquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rdquo; with not even his soul remaining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is being transformed to pure magicule in my body. In the process, Clayman would taste the suffering pain as if he is in hell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether you are a filthy soul, evil soul or evil kind soul, none can avoid it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All are equal before death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that moment I suddenly hear&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Ah, Laplace. You were right. I crossed the line. I should have followed your advice and stayed put&hellip; You view was always right&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;I seem to have heard Clayman&rsquo;s voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is he confessing?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So even this type of man of extreme evil would also confess&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hope Clayman would more or less reflect himself with my gift of &ldquo;Death&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that, Clayman&rsquo;s ambition has been destroyed. And he has become my food.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 555.00px; height: 789.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image17.png" style="width: 555.00px; height: 789.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="id.z337ya"></a><h2 class="c15" id="h.3j2qqm3"><span class="c6 c2">Chapter 6</span></h2><p class="c19"><span class="c2 c7 c24">Eight-Star Demon Lords</span></p><hr><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as I finish consuming Clayman, the red-hair Demon Lord stands up from his seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He then begins to speak with much majesty. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nicely done. I will approve you to use the title of Demon Lord in the future. Any objection?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any objection. It looks like they&rsquo;ve all recognized me as a Demon Lord now. Now I can be reassured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Honestly, it would be a suicidal act to try taking the hostile stance against the rest of the Demon Lords around here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, those concerns seem to be unnecessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I disengaged from the battlefield and Ramiris approaches by flying to talk to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I knew Rimuru could do it when he gets serious! That&rsquo;s why I told you, I&rsquo;ll allow you to study under me in the future&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, I&rsquo;ll pass, you can find student somewhere else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why? Why does it matter? Just be my student (underling), pretty please.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris starts to complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, Milim responds to her proudly:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu! Rimuru is my besties. He doesn&rsquo;t seem willing to get along with you now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehh? You must be kidding, Oi! Rimuru, that isn&rsquo;t true, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHAHAHA! You&rsquo;ve been elbowed out by me, Ramiris!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you just say&mdash;! Then check this out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim&#39;s deliberate provoke was successful, leading Ramiris to throw a flying kick to Milim&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim laughs delightfully as she casually dodges the kick.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two seem surprisingly close.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without my notice, Veldora began to chat to Demon Lord Dagruel intimately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seems to be showing off by discussing about his current training of surpassing aura.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He even points at me while saying &ldquo;You see that, Dagruel? That&rsquo;s the best example.&rdquo;, looking all smug.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dagruel replies &ldquo;Indeed. It was only for a short while, but I felt it dearly. The burst of magicule is impactful. Yet he concealed it so perfectly.&rdquo;, as such, in agreement with Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora seemed to have acted as the live commentator for me during my battle against Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">please stop doing this and spare me the trouble. It is because I know you would have done such things that I wanted you to stay at home&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dino seems to have lost interest once the battle was over and says dizzily:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh well, that&rsquo;s cool I guess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He simply throws out a line like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This Demon Lord is quite hard to see through and I have no idea what&rsquo;s on his mind. But at least he seems to recognize me as well, that should do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon on the other hand acts as if it is none of his business. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, I&rsquo;m not interested in whoever becomes Demon Lord. You guys can do whatever you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What a cold guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey and Karion don&rsquo;t seem object either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Which means, there&rsquo;s only one person left&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, the previously silent Demon Lord Valentine takes a heavy step forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, a lowly slime wants to be Demon Lord. I would never agree to that&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Valentine looks down to me with arrogance and said so to me in a glaring tone like an emperor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems he&rsquo;s voted against me. However, by the system of majority votes, I&rsquo;m positive that most of the Demon Lords here have approved of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then there won&rsquo;t be a problem&mdash;I thought so and decide to ignore him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ga&mdash;HAHAHA. Silly brat, how dare you insult my friend? Oi, Milus</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt49" id="ftnt_ref49">[49]</a></sup><span class="c1">, your underling is quite rude to his superior, should I teach him a lesson for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora said so to Valentine&rsquo;s maid without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eh, OI! What are you doing, mister??</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean by that? I&rsquo;m just a loyal maid to Demon Lord Valentine-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice is cold, cold as her expression&mdash;as Milus responds to Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, you can&rsquo;t do that! Valentine&rsquo;s been hiding her true identity, Veldora, you shouldn&rsquo;t expose other people like that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eh, Milim-san? Aren&rsquo;t you the one who&rsquo;s exposing other people?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was already skeptical about it before and it would seem my guess was correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The beautiful girl wearing maid suit, Milus, is the real Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her sights alone now could kill. That is the type of stare Milus is giving Milim right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim seems to have realized and begins to awkwardly whisper, trying to muddle through.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 551.00px; height: 808.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image18.png" style="width: 551.00px; height: 808.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You aren&rsquo;t even whispering out any sounds. Plus, it&rsquo;s no use for you to do something like that now. Milus doesn&#39;t seem to be the joking type, you probably can&rsquo;t have her forgive you after doing something like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milus menacingly glares around her surroundings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes tell that she wishes to kill everyone present to dispose of the witnesses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seems like the aggressive and dangerous type. But luckily Milus decides to give up the idea so as to not make her a public enemy here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Gee, you blasted evil dragon, ruining my</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt50" id="ftnt_ref50">[50]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;work every single time&hellip; Also, did you even forget my real name? You sure are irritating.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milus&mdash;no, Demon Lord Valentine says so with her intimidating aura unleashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora sure is casual, even remembering other people&rsquo;s name wrong. That probably have provoked Valentine even more. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Enough. You may call me Valentine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Valentine announces so with much displeasure. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Immediately after, she releases an immense amount of magic and changes her appearance instantly. Her maid suit disappears, and instead it was replaced with a luxurious black gothic dress.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s magical dress change&mdash;The quick clothes change magic that Milim is also good at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And a girl with heavenly beauty appears before us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, of course. The real deal is indeed different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The male Valentine is rather strong too, but the difference between the two is heaven and earth. The Demon Lord with both beauty and power thus enters the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Roy, you can go back first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Valentine displays the style of a king and orders the current Demon Lord Valentine after her dress change. It would seem that the Demon Lord valentine here is called Roy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, Valentine-sama&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no point in keep acting now after we&rsquo;ve been exposed in front of so many people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Valentine asserts so while staring at Veldora. Veldora is looking all awkward and mumbling &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault, none of my business&hellip;&rdquo;and tries to avoid eye contact with Valentine. These are barely excuses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the one who started all this, Milim, has it out of her mind completely now. To Milim, that&rsquo;s likely just a past event. Her habit of doing whatever she wants really can&rsquo;t be changed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she probably knows better than anyone that Valentine, apart from her rage, has no intention to extend her complaints any further.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now she&rsquo;s changed her mood and gave some strict orders to Roy, who now is simply an underling:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Besides, there&rsquo;s something on my mind right now. That guy Clayman has laid eyes on you, and his vision was frozen for a second. This may have something to do with the pest that invaded our territory. Go back and inform everyone to stay on guard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She says so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to her, it would seem then Clayman has been meddling in other people&rsquo;s business all this time. No wonder he is disliked so much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps he&rsquo;s just trying to find out more about the unknown domain of Valentine, what a reckless guy. Such love for information collecting is playing with fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After his response, Roy leaves alone to return to his country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t disobey Valentine&rsquo;s order. This means that Roy has little reluctance for the seat of Demon Lord and was indeed just a body-double.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This also shows the authority wielded by the real Valentine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, Valentine returns to her Demon Lord throne once more. </span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now let&rsquo;s restore everything to normal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I take out the round table from &ldquo;Stomach&rdquo; and place it properly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the right call to absorb it to protect it from breaking. If we had broken out fighting without such preparation in the fighting area, it would definitely damage the table. It looks quite expensive, so I have no intention to compensate for breaking it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Demon Lords return to the round table while the two maids working for Guy begin to serve everyone with red tea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon, slanting his eyes at the scene suddenly speaks:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;ah, now I recall. The name Kazaream sounds awfully familiar. It was the Demon Lord that I killed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I almost spit out the red tea I just drank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could Leon just suddenly say that in monotone without a single bit of emotion?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you know him, Leon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How come YOU don&rsquo;t know about him, Milim-san?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rest of the Demon Lords have a similar reaction to hers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who&rsquo;s that supposed to be? The majority think so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Ramiris has completely forgotten about him. Don&rsquo;t you have any memory to those things? I want to tease her about that, but I digress out of pity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;So where did the name Kazaream come from?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&hellip; Answer. Clayman just called out to a number of people. One of the names was &ldquo;Kazaream&rdquo;.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh yeah! Now I recall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Which other name did he call out now&hellip; Just to clarify, I remember everything very clearly, please don&rsquo;t treat me as the likes of Milim and Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So what would be the relationship between this Kazaream and Clayman?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I attempted to ask and got an answer from Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kazaream was the &lsquo;Cursed King&rsquo;. Milim, didn&rsquo;t you and Kazaream recommend me to become a Demon Lord?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s that guy. I remember there was a &lsquo;Cursed King&rsquo;. Right, he&rsquo;s the Demon Lord that Leon killed.&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She can&rsquo;t remember the name but still recalls the title. That&rsquo;s somewhat acceptable, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s the only Demon Lord Leon has beaten. But in my view, she must have forgotten because it is unimportant&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, I remember Kazaream was an Undead Elf</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt51" id="ftnt_ref51">[51]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;just like Clayman. And it&rsquo;s the mutated species of elves that evolved through their own efforts. I used to have some connection with him in private and heard that Clayman took over Kazaream&rsquo;s territory. From that we can infer the two are connected secretly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion reminiscent of the past and turns to tell me that. It seems Karion thinks Kazaream is not as bad as Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wow, right, wait a second? I almost skipped through that, but since Kazaream is also undead elf&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Could it be that Kazaream is still alive? Did he pretend to be killed by Leon and in reality, have hidden himself somewhere else?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, that guy is capable of that indeed. Kazaream, he&rsquo;s a much more difficult guy to deal with than Clayman. He is a smart man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion agrees to my view, so I think it&rsquo;s likely the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You say it as if I had intentionally let him slip. Unbelievable. He used to proclaim so arrogantly that he will assist me to become a Demon Lord one day as long as I serve under his reign. I didn&rsquo;t even bother to refuse and simply took his place by defeating. Whether he&rsquo;s dead or alive now is none of my concern.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leon says so without any shame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suppose Leon just wanted to show his strength instead of actually killing Kazaream. That&rsquo;s why he doesn&rsquo;t care about his status now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi oi oi, Leon. It must be because this kind of attitude of yours that Clayman hated you so much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, I&rsquo;m not interested.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion decides to advise Leon but was met with a cold answer. But it probably would only trouble Leon more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of which, I didn&rsquo;t know Clayman was working against Leon as well, he sure had a lot of enemies. Is he really a smart guy? I become more and more skeptical. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if that&rsquo;s the case, I seem to have a rough idea of what Kazaream and Clayman&rsquo;s plan is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I heard that it&rsquo;s been around two hundred years since Leon become a Demon Lord, and apart from helping Karion and Clayman becoming Demon Lord, Kazaream likely wanted to have more companions within the Demon Lord rank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is probably for that reason that Clayman carried out the plan to turn orc lord into a Demon Lord. It is to have more people to help out and have more of a presence during the Banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This type of idea of creating big group of comrade seems to be quite scummy and isn&rsquo;t appropriate for a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it is indeed an effective plan, so I could understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Among Clayman&rsquo;s companions, there is an organization called &lsquo;The Moderate Clown Troupe&rsquo;. They seem to receive assistance from humans and it&rsquo;s likely the revived Kazaream has possessed onto some human.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I begin to explain my theory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having been defeated by Leon, Kazaream&rsquo;s body seemed to have been destroyed. This is why in order to revive himself, it must start with his astral body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that was the case, he would naturally want to possess onto other living being.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, if he had revived in the resident area of other Demon Lords, he would have been discovered immediately. Kazaream, who has yet to be discovered till this day, must have hid somewhere other than the domains of Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s the case. Leon&rsquo;s attack could even destroy spiritual body. It&rsquo;s rather commendable that Kazaream was even able to figure out a way to survive. Moreover, it would take several hundred years&rsquo; time for even us, the Demon race, to revive from our soul form. It&rsquo;s definitely worse for Undead Elf. So it&rsquo;s unlikely that he was able to revive himself with his own strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy surprisingly agrees to my view.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike spiritual life form such as Demon race, the Undead relies on flesh. This is why the revival of his astral body requires a lot of time. It&rsquo;s a miracle that he was even able to survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is Guy&rsquo;s explanation summarized.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, it&rsquo;s highly possible that someone has been assisting him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there isn&rsquo;t any reliable source of information regarding these connections behind the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyhow, we&rsquo;ll leave it like this for now. Regardless, we must assume now that Kazaream has been revived. Stay on alert. Clayman has been killed, so I would think he will probably hate me a lot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHAHAHAHA! Rimuru, you are quite strong, so don&rsquo;t worry about it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Idiot! Don&rsquo;t you know you will get defeated for being so careless!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim suddenly replies as I spoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a way I responded so to serve as a reminder for myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our grand victory today wiped out all of Clayman&rsquo;s forces, so I&rsquo;d think the enemies won&rsquo;t take any action any time soon. But I can&rsquo;t get careless now. It&rsquo;s fine if they go after me alone, but right now I have companions to take care of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I need to put more thoughts into defense in the future and draft some response strategies.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The short break ended with the meeting once again held.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman who was previously the host of meeting has now been forcefully retired. So Guy took his place and host the meeting. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Our topic of discussion today is the betrayal of Karion and the rise of the Rimuru guy over there. And all these issues have been resolved. Karion never betrayed us and Rimuru has shown power worthy of the role of Demon Lord. I think the meeting is done so far. But since it&rsquo;s a rather rare occasion, does anyone have any suggestion to make?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey begins to speak, seemingly awaiting that line.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Could you allow me to speak for a moment? Right now we are during the middle of our meeting, so I have a suggestion to make, or rather, a request to make, I suppose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fair enough, have at you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Guy has approved, Frey nods and proceeds:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From today onward, I&rsquo;ve decided to follow Milim&rsquo;s rule. Based on that, I would like to give out my seat as a Demon Lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such it&rsquo;s the big shocker she just tossed out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi oi oi, why are you saying this all of a sudden?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, Frey! How come I never heard you mention about this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;ve kept silent. But I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it for some time now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey squeezes her eyes and drifts afar as she speaks.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey recalls to herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was talking to Milim then. Their conversation made Frey determine to have faith in Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let me ask you this, Frey. Would you like to be my friend?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Why do you ask that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because I made a friend like Rimuru! Friends are really amazing; they help each other out all the time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well now, is that so? About that, Milim&hellip; If you are willing to help me, I would like to be your friend then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really! Then I will definitely agree to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haha, that&rsquo;s pleasing. However, I am rather cautious. So if you are willing to follow a &ldquo;promise&rdquo;, then I&rsquo;ll trust you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright I know! Then we can be friends together!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey doesn&rsquo;t trust Clayman, that&rsquo;s why she chose to believe Milim. She gets to keep herself safe while pretending to have accepted Clayman&rsquo;s advice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Milim didn&rsquo;t follow the promise, had she actually been manipulated&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although she feels unease, Frey decided to gamble on Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so in the end, it was her victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is the reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason why Frey decides to put her faith in Milim and follow her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This lone and arrogant Queen has not trusted anyone before, and this is the first time she entrusts herself to any individual.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey seems to have recalled something and had a chuckle about it. Then, she announces with determination:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyhow, there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons for why. But the most important one of them is that I feel like I am too weak to be a Demon Lord. After witnessing that battle just now, I was further convinced. If I am to fight against Clayman, I could barely manage to make it a draw in the end. Not to add that Clayman became awakened mid-fight, so there&rsquo;s no way I could have won&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But Frey, aren&rsquo;t you good at high-speed aerial combat? Is there really a need to look down on yourself like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dagruel tries to defend her, but Frey seems already determined.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m more advantageous in aerial combat. But that&rsquo;s no excuse for not being a Demon Lord. Moreover, I know it&rsquo;s not enough to just have some advantages&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon saying so, Frey peeks at me.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she proceeds with the words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;So, that&rsquo;s why I decided to work under Milim. Besides, Milim can&rsquo;t always act so stubborn, right? She needs to learn how to run her own territory now, shouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That means Frey isn&rsquo;t saying so just for her own sake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim is indeed a dangerous individual that can&rsquo;t be let loose on her own. There needs to be someone who can assist her and watch over her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey understands her short-coming. But in my view, she&rsquo;s not as weak as she describes. It can be said that she is a different type of strategist from Clayman, one whose ideas can&rsquo;t be seen through. It&rsquo;s quite terrifying when you think about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In anyhow, she is the typical type of person that let you go &ldquo;women are terrifying&rdquo;. I suppose that&rsquo;s why I feel she&rsquo;s particularly scary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what would really happen if that&rsquo;s the case (Frey serving Milim)?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she is no longer a Demon Lord but proceeds as a servant. Her combat ability is undoubtedly worthy of Milim. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no recognized nation under Milim&rsquo;s name, but would she now possess territory once Frey becomes her subordinate?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When the time comes for me to build an alliance with Milim&rsquo;s country, the engagement may be complicated with Frey&rsquo;s involvement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or rather, it would be more interesting that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, do you accept my proposition?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey looks towards Milim as she continues her speech.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;B-but I don&rsquo;t give out visas&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as she attempts to reject the proposition&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold your horses. I&rsquo;ve got something to say about this as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With such statement, Karion joins in their conversation,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I, too, has lost to Milim during a duel. I think life is all about being straightforward, so I want to surrender to her. In terms of our titles, the Demon Lords have the same place. It&rsquo;s a different case when fighting against a Chosen Hero, but now I&rsquo;ve lost to another Demon Lord, so I ought to step down. Which means there&rsquo;s no excuse for me to keep being a Demon Lord. That&rsquo;s why now I&rsquo;ll be Milim&rsquo;s subordinate from now on. Please take care of me, BOSS!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This one just decides to straight up ignore her personal will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I understand that power is everything to all the Demon Lords, but this is just&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim doesn&rsquo;t take any subordinate and so she won&rsquo;t get objection from them. But now suddenly two current Demon Lords fall under her reign, how does that even make any sense?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a second, Karion! The duel thing was all Clayman&rsquo;s doing! I was manipulated, I&rsquo;ve got nothing to do with that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s just quibble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t think excuse like that would work, Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other Demon Lords are also looking at her, dumbfounded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey now, stop lying. You did just say &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to manipulate me!&rdquo;, and you said it so confidently!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion&rsquo;s impersonation is really on point and was able to reenact Milim&rsquo;s words. I&rsquo;m surprised he turns out to be so talented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm? T-that, that was&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, don&rsquo;t mind that idiot who&rsquo;s all brawn and no brain, you will take me in right, Milim?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-you are saying that hoping to trick me, right? Becoming my minister or underling, and you won&rsquo;t talk to me like an equal again, right? And you won&rsquo;t play with me or do pranks with me either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey shakes her head hearing Milim&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. We get to be together forever in that way. And we get to do more fun things together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She begins to brainwash Milim with such things&mdash;Trying to instigate her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You see, it&rsquo;s this type of things that makes you cautious around her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Karion, he does have a strong personal style and cuts to the trace:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bottom line is, it&rsquo;s all because you&rsquo;ve trashed my kingdom to shreds! Rimuru-san promised to help us, but you&rsquo;d also have the duty to take care of us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t think that type of duty exists, but Milim seems to be clueless against this type of logic. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion, is surprisingly witty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim seems to have taken Karion&rsquo;s words for it and almost fainted. But then she bursts out as if she doesn&rsquo;t want to care about any of this anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So ANNOYING&mdash;! Alight, alright, whatever you guys want!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Smoke begins to flow out from Milim&rsquo;s head like the eruption of a volcano. Milim.exe has stopped working.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sasuga Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seems smart but never actually uses her brain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Karion, do you really wish to do that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ve thought through a lot already. I don&rsquo;t intend to retire from being the king of the beast kingdom. I merely wish to pursue Milim and build up a new system.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion gave a simple and clear answer to Guy&rsquo;s question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was rather fond of you. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll also awake given another couple hundred years and I was looking forward to it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy sighs through his nose and says so with disappointment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he immediately switches to a smile and announces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very well! From now on, Frey and Karion are no longer Demon Lords. You two can go server Milim as you desire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Guy&rsquo;s words out, the two are officially released from the duty of Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one present seem to object.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course, I&rsquo;m none the wiser.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, I&rsquo;ve officially been approved and inaugurated as Demon Lord. I eliminated another one alongside with the retirement of two other, who decided to be Milim&rsquo;s subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Ten Great Demon Lords are now Eight Great Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just as I thought the meeting is over, there seems to be another issue to resolve in the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I said it without much care and started the whole ordeal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh yeah, so it&rsquo;s not Ten Great Demon Lords anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This quickly sparked responses from all the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite annoying indeed. It&rsquo;s a matter of prestige, so we&rsquo;ve got to come up with a new title.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dagruel says so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eh? Is it really that important?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Glad that the banquet has yet to be dismissed. Now that all the Demon Lords are gathered, we may come up with some good ideas.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Valentine who doesn&rsquo;t take jokes lightly begins to follow with a serious expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oi oi oi, we don&rsquo;t need to be that cautious with something like titles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if we let it slide, the humans will definitely make up names for us by themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone drained our brain doing this last time. Every time we decide to change our name the number of members just keep fluctuating. And then several banquets just pass with no result&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ehhhh! Did you guys seriously hold the Banquet just for some boring trivia like that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I recall Ramiris was being exaggerated when she mentioned that the banquet is a special meeting that all Demon Lords must attend&hellip; that doesn&rsquo;t seem right or is it just simply a tea party in the beginning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I feel whatever changes would be okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, like the last title &lsquo;Ten Great Demon Lords&rsquo; was in the end how the humans call us. We wasted so much brain cells just trying to come up with a name. So leave me out of this one, I&rsquo;ve got no more strength to spare&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No no no, whether you can do it is a different thing. You are just too lazy to think at all.So stop saying that as if you&rsquo;ve gone through much serious contemplations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quiet, people. All you&rsquo;ve been doing is complaining. There isn&rsquo;t anything constructive at all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean by that Valentine. You sure talk the talk when you push all the work to Roy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Valentines says so which resonates with me, yet it was countered with a single line from Dino. Unlike Milim or Ramiris, this lazy bone here has sharp words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But why would it cost so much time just trying to come up with a name. Or rather, they seem all so pumped up by it, could the Demon Lords be really bored in life?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After asking around I learnt that it took them several years to settle for a name last time. But as they were halfway through, the humans began to call them &ldquo;Ten Great Demon Lords&rdquo;. Thus the Demon Lords in favor of naming drastically decrease. As long as they can come up with a good name, they seem to be fine with moderating the number of Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so they decided to use the title officially, but not everyone was fine with how it sounded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s one nonchalant info.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You guys need to calm down now. It is time like this we need to show some comradery to sail through difficult times together, unlike how we usually behave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy was straight to the point about their lack of unity in most days.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris begins to mumble to herself hearing Guy&rsquo;s word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, but&hellip; This time is, Eight Great&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though she says so, her mumbling dies down under the immense silent pressure exerted by the rest of the crowd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She then restarted with something else: &ldquo;Ah yes. What a great speech by Guy! Let&rsquo;s work hard together now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone seems to be against the title Eight Great Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this is not a symbol of unity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHAHAHA! I&rsquo;ll leave this task to you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired, time for bed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It didn&rsquo;t take long before the unfitting bunch starts to appear one by one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I should have guessed that, they are Demon Lords indeed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d say it would be an impossible mission to unite them all, and my guess was right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, someone suddenly appeared to break this awkward atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This brainlet of a man now stands right behind me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? If that&rsquo;s the issue, my friend Rimuru is pretty good at it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora who has started to feel bored and wanted to go back soon, said this out of nowhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">OH NOO, the Demon Lords&rsquo; eyes now have all fixated on.me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why don&rsquo;t you go read you damn manga instead of spilling nonsense here. But, could it be that he has finished all his manga? Even the last volume?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim has her eyes locked on Veldora, no, Veldora&rsquo;s mangas in his hands. Those eyes are sharper than those of eagles&rsquo; when locking on prey, causing me to feel a lot of unease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it&rsquo;s not the time to worry about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone agreeing with Veldora appears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speaking of that, he also named my Beretta super-fast!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now she&rsquo;s tossed me the hot potato with all that nonsense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This girl&hellip; She&rsquo;s getting more and more casual with me. It vaguely reflects a sense of dependence she&rsquo;s growing towards me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While I turn unconsciously, the rest of the Demon Lords are also looking at me with expectation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is bad. I&rsquo;ve been surrounded!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Demon Lords exchange looks, and Guy stands up to speak in everyone&rsquo;s name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru, the newly risen Demon Lord, today I shall grant you an epic special privilege.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, no thanks. I don&rsquo;t need that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I attempt to cut him up as soon as possible. However, my imaginations were too naive. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chong-dong! As I hear the loud noise, the giant round table that reflects with textures of obsidian and looks quite expensive is now severed in half with by someone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy ignores my rejection with a smile and continues:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course you need it, the privilege to create a new title for us. This is of great honor, you must really want to accept it, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He walks towards me casually and proclaims to me and fondles my cheek.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is this some sort of flighty display to ask for a favor?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he looks gentle like water, his tone sounds irrefusable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am speechless. Neither could I accept, nor could I reject, so I decide to exercise my rights to remain silence, however&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy starts to push against my cheek hard with his fingers, while biting my ears and whispers: &ldquo;By the way, aren&rsquo;t you the way causing our layoffs of members today? You will take responsibility and help think up a name now, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may seem to the rest is some lover wanting to get spoiled, but it&rsquo;s not the case at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a threat!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alas, I couldn&rsquo;t refuse anyway considering how everything went.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t believe how troublesome this has become.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, alright. Gosh. Then don&rsquo;t complain later that you don&rsquo;t like the name I make.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took the task with much unwillingness after giving up struggling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Demon Lords are all with smiling faces as if saying &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, now we are reassured.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some people even ask for more tea and decide to rest from then on. They always like to push their work to other people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fine then, I won&rsquo;t care about them either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are eight Demon Lords in total, so Eight Great Demon Lord is okay&hellip; But it seems a bit too straight forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whatever Ramiris was just about to say is probably Eight Great Demon Lords, so I&rsquo;d refrain from using that. After all, you could feel the immense pressure emitted from the rest of the group, telling her to stop. I definitely won&rsquo;t make it now if I get those threatening stares.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So &ldquo;Eight Great Demon Lords&rdquo; is a no go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of which, tonight is the new moon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The shining stars in the night sky are very pretty&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about &lsquo;Eight-Star Demon Lords&rsquo;(Octagram)? You can say it&rsquo;s an inspiration from Eight awn star&#12290;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, a period of silence dawns the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Demon Lords all begin to close their eyes and think over these words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, everyone opens up their eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That would be it, it sounds very nice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can definitely win with this name! A new age has arrived!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! I know Rimuru could do it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You sure know your stuff. As expected from candidate nominated by Veldora.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, sounds alright. Then I shall agree with you a little.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You got it in an instance! That&rsquo;s pretty cool. I don&rsquo;t know why we wasted so much time on this last time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;Hmm *</span><span class="c2 c16">Dino Approval Sound</span><span class="c1">*.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any objection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s great. And if anyone would like to object, I&rsquo;ll have him think of a name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although I don&rsquo;t know who Milim is trying to compete with or win. It&rsquo;s a bit concerning but I won&rsquo;t go after it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also Dino, I want to ask you what the blaze were you all discussing before&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some of the people here&rsquo;s reaction raises a lot of question for me, but I manage to play dumb like an adult to make it through.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the moment onward, the Demon Lords introduce themselves with a new title to be respected by the world.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The so called Octagram, Eight-Star Demon Lord&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demon &mdash;&rdquo;Lord of Darkness&rdquo;Guy Crimson</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dragonoid &mdash;&rdquo;Destroyer&rdquo;Milim Nava</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Fairy &mdash;&rdquo;Fairy of Labyrinth&rdquo;Ramiris</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt52" id="ftnt_ref52">[52]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Titan &mdash;&rdquo;Fury of Earth&rdquo;Dagruel</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt53" id="ftnt_ref53">[53]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vampire &mdash;&rdquo;Queen of Nightmare&rdquo;Valentine</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fallen Angel &mdash;&rdquo;Sleeping Ruler&rdquo;Dino</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ex-Human &mdash;&rdquo;Platinum Saber&rdquo;Leon Cromwell</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Monster &mdash;&rdquo;Newbie&rdquo;Rimuru Tempest</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt54" id="ftnt_ref54">[54]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash; In total, eight members as mentioned above.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From today onward, the new age of Demon Lords has arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But first, we need to divide territory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My domain would be the entirety of Jura Great Forest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s a nice treatment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, Milim got it better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The combined territory of Frey, Karion and Clayman is now under Milim&rsquo;s control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she only rules it in name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The inner work of the territory would be run by Karion, Frey and the Worshippers of Dragon who follow Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition, the previous territory belonged to Clayman now falls in the buffer zone with the territory of eastern empire. They must investigate how he has run it and built up defense line.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That seems to be a difficult and time, labor-consuming job. However, that would be Milim&rsquo;s worries. I&rsquo;d rather prioritize my works at hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rest of the Demon Lords&rsquo; territory remain the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some of which simply wanders around without territory, some of which hides their territory, or lives in a different continent. As such, no one really knows about other people&rsquo;s territory, and thus there&rsquo;s no notion of changing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These Demon Lords all act according to their wishes and have their own means of communication.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;Ring&rdquo; I received as the proof of being a Demon Lord, not only can it identify the person itself, it is able to make &ldquo;Cross-Spacetime Communication &ldquo;with other Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It even has the secret call function for individuals, and also the ability to make a group call. What a convenient magical item.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With this ring&mdash;Demon Lord&rsquo;s ring, you can even make call from &ldquo;Infinite Prison&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since it&rsquo;s so convenient, I would like to put it in &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo; and mass produce it. But that would be a secret.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Clayman&rsquo;s conspiracy&mdash;the series of unrest within the Jura Forest, these are all finally settled. I&rsquo;ve gained approval and become a new Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although Clayman&rsquo;s master&mdash;Kazaream does raise concern for me, the issues regarding the Demon Lords are at last resolved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;As such, I&rsquo;ve become a member of the Octagram.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 561.00px; height: 792.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image19.png" style="width: 561.00px; height: 792.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.1y810tw"><span class="c6 c2">Epilogue</span><a id="id.4i7ojhp"></a></h2><p class="c19"><span class="c24 c2 c7">The Holy Land</span></p><hr><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought I was dead for sure&mdash;bearing this in mind, Laplace tries to escape with everything he&rsquo;s got.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to the plan, once the banquet begins, he would attempt to invade the holy land. He was planning to go to infiltrate the &ldquo;Inner sanctum&rdquo; where he last encountered the demon lord. Laplace headed towards the interior of the holy church, however&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He encountered the person he least wanted to see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the strongest beauty &ldquo;Head of knights of the pope&rsquo;s Imperial guards&rdquo; and the commander of the Holy Knight Order, Hinata Sakaguchi.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">What the hell! How did this happen, this isn&rsquo;t going as he promised at all!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace complains in heart about his employer who&rsquo;s not present.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all the promise and meetings, the employer decided to take care of distracting Hinata by asking her out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ahaha, sorry, sorry! He seems to hear the casual apologies of his employer. This is clearly a hallucination, but Laplace is still pissed about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even so, this is no time to complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How dare you infiltrate such holy residence; you pests surely are annoying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace got scared almost to death hearing Hinata spitting out that line cold-bloodedly. He escaped without hesitation and was able to save his ass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could he be motivated at all to explore the &ldquo;Inner sanctum&rdquo;, the mission was a failure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, it&rsquo;s not Laplace&rsquo;s fault.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c16">And just when I thought demon lord Valentine is out&hellip; I won&rsquo;t stand a chance if that woman is guarding the place&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How the hell I am supposed to win against that type of monster&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace mumbles, he&rsquo;s already given up and decided to retreat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of which&hellip; Laplace thinks to himself&mdash; I&rsquo;ve been running away a lot lately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am good enough to be able to escape from Hinata&mdash;he wants to praise himself that, but he still feels rather conflicted. Lately his luck has been on the downside, so he&rsquo;d better not get cocky now and thinks he&rsquo;d be able to escape&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace&rsquo;s thoughts were paused at that moment when he senses a strong shockwave of magic while seeing a distortion of space outside in the surrounding of Ruberios. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehhh&hellip;no&hellip;way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m dead&mdash;Laplace wants to cry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whatever is causing the phenomenon is already far beyond the realm of higher majin, it&rsquo;s clearly a powerful individual on a different level. Moreover, Laplace is somewhat familiar with that wavelength. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Trash, how dare you show yourself before me again!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rage of Demon Lord Valentine burn, his furious shouts spread all around Laplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it! And now we get a demon lord!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the worst; Laplace wants to exclaim out loud for his misfortune. But right now, there&rsquo;s no time for such things. He again braces himself to escape with all he has.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh! You trashes are all the same. Why are you all so fond of running away?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;At that instant, Laplace is estranged by the words of Valentine. He stops his footstep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, it&rsquo;s none of your business, but I&rsquo;ll tell you anyway. Just now, Demon Lord Clayman is dead. That moronic, treacherous trash is just like you, running around with his tails tucked. He even cried embarrassingly in the end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Valentine spitted out the line, unimpressed and mockingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, why are you getting so pumped up about it? This is none of your business, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut your mouth! Oi, you said Clayman is dead, is it true?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ha&mdash;&mdash;HAHAHA! Trash, now you&rsquo;ve slipped up. Of course you are all in this together. Everything is as Ruminas-sama predicted!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace is frozen in shock watching Valentine laughed out loud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clayman is dead, he can&rsquo;t quite process that for the moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not exactly impossible to believe, but he&rsquo;s not willing to do that. To Laplace, Clayman may be a bit psycho at times, but he&rsquo;s still his companion who shares the same dream and ambition, more importantly, a good friend to Laplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you laughing at, you bastard!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Trash, who do you think&hellip; Guwu&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;YOU SONUVABITCH! STOP LAUGHING AT MY FRIEND!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beaten to death with bare hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would be the words most suited to describe the scene. Laplace&rsquo;s fists did not stop for an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wuu, don&rsquo;t get all cocky now, you trash!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Valentine&rsquo;s face started to turn red due to the anger and humiliation, shouting and staring at Laplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The opponent it&rsquo;s Valentine who possesses &ldquo;Ultraspeed regeneration&rdquo;, no matter how you beat me it won&rsquo;t work at all. The fools must be punished and killed. Valentine thinks to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He unconsciously rubs away the blood that has splashed out, no, he was turning the blood into a red mist of blood fog, spreading it to the surrounding&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go to hell, &lsquo;Blood Flash Shock Wave&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Being trapped in the inescapable blood barrier, the blood beam fired towards Laplace who is impossible to escape&mdash;Yet it didn&rsquo;t go as he wished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s futile, you are already dead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Wuu!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Valentine couldn&rsquo;t react in time. He, who possesses immense power is being played by such low life trash. He planned on using his strongest skill to take his life, yet strangely, his ability is not activated. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tonight is indeed the night of new moon; it is the day when Valentine has the least amount of power. But it matters very little when you&rsquo;ve reached a level such as demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps the weakening didn&rsquo;t really have an impact. Then, there is only one logical explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace is very strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That explanation is quite correct indeed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace is holding something in his hand, something that is still beating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Wuu!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, this is your heart (core) that I hold in my hand. You can&rsquo;t move now, can&rsquo;t even make a sound, right? This is all my work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He announces that cruelly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unknowingly, Valentine&rsquo;s body starts to tremble. Almost if&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Is, is this fear? Am I afraid?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are rather late to realize that. Yeah, I&rsquo;m pretty strong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Color begins to fade on Valentine&rsquo;s face, and he begins to show a desperate expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What Laplace is holding is indeed my heart&mdash;Valentine realizes that in shock and realizes his defeat. Seeing the expression on his opponent, Laplace begins to laugh hysterically and smashes the heart into bits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The victory has been settled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace won&rsquo;t stop laughing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Ah ah, Footman is gonna be pissed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He laughs as he kills off all the guards who discovered him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Ah ah, Tear is definitely gonna cry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He bears his head deep and attempts to escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;That&rsquo;s why, I&rsquo;m going to laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He thinks &ldquo;You are one big dumbass&rdquo;, this is Laplace&rsquo;s teasing of Clayman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because he thinks, that&rsquo;s the best way to send off &ldquo;The Laughing Clown&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He won&rsquo;t be angry and won&rsquo;t cry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He will laugh in place of his friend who can no longer laugh. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace laughs.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 610.94px; height: 862.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image19.png" style="width: 610.94px; height: 862.50px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 937.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image20.jpg" style="width: 602.00px; height: 937.33px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 929.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 602.00px; height: 929.33px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.2xcytpi"></a><h2 class="c15" id="h.1ci93xb"><span class="c6 c2">Author&rsquo;s afterword</span></h2><hr><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Long time no see!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s been five months since the last volume, and here I bring you the sixth volume of &lt;&lt;That time I got reincarnated as a slime&gt;&gt;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now it&rsquo;s afterword time as usual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time I again confront Editor I-san and had an intense war regarding whether I should write this or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I was writing the first volume, I-san was very gentle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you really dislike writing afterword, it&rsquo;s okay to skip it~!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so?

Eight pages, isn&rsquo;t that too many?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mean, afterword has reached eight pages, isn&rsquo;t that a bit much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So of course I would have concerns about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh well it can&rsquo;t be helped. Due to binding issue with the book, if we are to cut down blank pages, the entire afterword would be lost.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, then I should just skip it&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way, what do you mean by that? You have to write the afterword.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we agreed during volume 1 that it&rsquo;s not necessary, that kind and gentle Editor I-san is gone&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, I am quite fond of reading afterword of my novel I like, but whenever it is my turn to write, I am in the &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay to skip it&rdquo; faction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ability to think flexibly with accordance to different points of view is one of my special talent&mdash;but it can&rsquo;t work now&mdash;I tried to use this talent to convince I-san, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you write it even if we need to increase pages! What &ldquo;not writing afterword&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s not an option for you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After getting a scolding from the editor, my road to not writing afterword is blocked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I understand it won&rsquo;t matter even if I struggle more, so after countless negotiations I get to cut down some of the pages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh well, however.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s time for the clich&eacute; every time&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This time there may be a few more pages&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, just don&rsquo;t mind it and keep writing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with that little interjection, they still wanted me to write the afterword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve always concerned about the increase of pages, and as it turns out the worries were unnecessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The pages of the actual story have increased a lot and now the pages for afterword needs to increase as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Editor I-san is truly crazy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, when I hand in my first draft, here are I-san&rsquo;s thoughts:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;XX scene seems to have been cut, what happened there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s just that the pages involved are too many, so I had to cut it out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way you are serious about that?! We have to leave that scene in!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, but the rest of the content is not easily cut to fit it in&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously, don&rsquo;t worry over the cuts! Just write it. You can write as much as&lt;&lt;Slime&gt;&gt; if you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a conversation we had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end when I finished the first draft, the content has increased the most since I started with an addition of around ten thousand words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Due to the double line typesetting, it&rsquo;s rumored to be the light novel with the most words from GC series. And even the page number has jumped to number one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve made a new record!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Editor I-san says so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How ambitious is his?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all this trouble, volume six is finally out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The volume has packed with most content in Tensura series, I hope everyone would have a fun time reading it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now as followed I would like to do some discussion regarding the content of the volume.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I&rsquo;ve mentioned in volume 2, I always read afterwords when I read a book.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why there will be obvious spoiler, so you should prepare yourself before reading.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19 c8"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I&rsquo;ve mentioned in the afterword of volume 5, I&rsquo;ve added a lot of content this time as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can tell from the catalogue, Rimuru gets recognized in the volume and becomes a real Demon Lord. It&rsquo;s written up to the birth of &ldquo;Eight Star Demon Lords&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Based on the fourth arc &ldquo;Birth of Demon Lord&rdquo; from the Web version, I present the full story in volume 5 and volume 6.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the content from the web version of &ldquo;Birth of Demon Lord&rdquo; is not enough for fill the whole of volume 5, you can imagine that most of the content was added afterward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve also interacted with Editor I-san and so the content is just like what I&rsquo;ve mentioned in the afterword of volume 5.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ve worked hard on this in order to avoid being called that the effort in my work is all filler like Calpis</span><sup class="c2 c5"><a href="#ftnt55" id="ftnt_ref55">[55]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;diluted in water. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s about it regarding this volume&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As usual, there are many characters present this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would probably be easier for web version reader to remember them, but the light novel reader may have a hard time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that I think about it more carefully, this light novel has twice as many words as most standard light novel, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be that many characters being presented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone must want to see the illustrations, right&mdash;About that, I&rsquo;ll rely on Mitz Vah sensei&rsquo;s work!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ten Great Demon Lords&mdash;Eh? Why are there eleven people?
