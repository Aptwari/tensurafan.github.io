<h1 class="ch-number">Prologue</h1>
<h1 class="ch-name">The Golden Melancholy</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_27">It was a pure white mansion. There were blossoming flowers of all kinds in the garden. A young girl smiled as a young boy observed her.</p>
<p id="line_28">That was a happy time in the past, and the memory of it hadn’t faded one bit. His one goal in life had been to retrieve such happiness. Yet, it was a task harder than traveling to the moon.</p>
<p id="line_29">The mansion—the golden city that he had built. There was also a beautiful garden, like a paradise in heaven. It was far more luxurious and grandiose than the one in his memory. Yet the most important aspect, the key to his memory just somehow couldn’t be found.</p>
<p id="line_30">Even after he had become a force to be reckoned with in this world, he was unable to find his beloved young girl. And without her, he could never find his smile.</p>
<p id="line_31">All of this had been prepared for his beloved young girl.</p>
<p id="line_32">His name was Leon Cromwell. One of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, known as the “Platinum Saber.” And the girl that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon was seeking was—</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_33">This was the kingdom that Leon ruled—the Golden Valley El Dorado. The royal castle, in the shape of a spiral, towered at the center of the kingdom. The location was the meeting hall of the royal castle.</p>
<p id="line_34">Leon exuded an air of majesty on his throne as three suspicious individuals kneeled before him. They were garbed in all black and adorned with rain hats, a rather bizarre look. Their outfit looked the same as that of the weapon merchant Damrada. It went without saying that this was Laplace’s party.</p>
<p id="line_35">“—You again. Isn’t this the second time?”</p>
<p id="line_36">“Yes. To have the honor of being recognized by His Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon, we are most grateful. However, we regret to inform you that we will be suspending the transaction of the confidential merchandise this time.”</p>
<p id="line_37">It was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who answered Leon in a rather serious tone. It was an attempt to make them seem more appealing by letting the female <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> do the negotiating.</p>
<p id="line_38">This was also going to be their last engagement. They had decided to follow <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s plan and pause all activities in the Western Nations.</p>
<p id="line_39"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Misha" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of the ‘Cerberus’ organization would continue to act as a correspondent to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> family. While they proceeded with their prior transactions, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party would move their headquarters to the Eastern Empire.</p>
<p id="line_40">In addition, losing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also greatly reduced the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s strength.</p>
<p id="line_41">In truth, the supplier of their top-secret merchandise was the kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Siltrosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and right now the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> family didn’t possess enough power to conduct any more summonings.</p>
<p id="line_42">Moreover, now that Tempest had joined the Western States Council, the Western Nations would be under the influence of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Their surveillance would be tighter than ever.</p>
<p id="line_43">Laplace and the others all agreed that it was time to leave.</p>
<p id="line_44">“Ho, that’s quite bold of you. Unlike Damrada, you wish to raise the price with me so soon?”</p>
<p id="line_45">“No no no, you have misunderstood. As His Majesty Leon is probably aware, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has cemented his place in the Western Nations. He’s rather displeased with the summoning of otherworlders and strictly forbids it. We believe that it wouldn’t be easy to continue the trade under these circumstances,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> answered smoothly.</p>
<p id="line_46">Hearing this, Leon thought to himself—<em>as I suspected</em>.</p>
<p id="line_47">He had sent some of his men to blend in within the Western Nations, and they reported the same things. Leon himself thought that things would develop in that direction sooner or later.</p>
<p id="line_48">Honestly, there was too much uncertainty with this method. The rate of success was astronomically low. It was an approach that was unlikely to work from the start.</p>
<p id="line_49">After all, this was about summoning a specific individual to this world—</p>
<p id="line_50">He had ordered his subordinates to do the summoning countless times. It took more than thirty summoners working together in the span of seven days of rituals with detailed procedures to do the summoning to Leon’s specific criteria.</p>
<p id="line_51">Yet the rate of success was less than one percent. Moreover, it would take some time for the same person to conduct the summoning ritual again, and the number of times a person could attempt the ritual was also limited.</p>
<p id="line_52">From the start, the rate of success was close to zero.</p>
<p id="line_53">Even Leon himself had conducted many summons, yet they all ended in failure. His last summon called upon Shizue Izawa, and tomorrow, it would be sixty-six years since she was summoned. If he wanted to narrow down the conditions into the summoning rituals, the interval between summons would be even longer.</p>
<p id="line_54">The next summon was not worth looking forward to, either. That was why he devised the ‘Incomplete Summoning’ rituals. It was a young girl that Leon was looking for. That was why the incomplete summon, which had a higher chance of summoning children, should raise his rate of success, even though it would be barely noticeable in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p id="line_55">He planned to spread the method among the Western Nations, thereby increasing the chance of success by raising the number of summons attempted and thus gathering more children…</p>
<p id="line_56">—Yet to this day, it had been a complete failure.</p>
<p id="line_57">There was no other way, and he could not think of any other alternatives.</p>
<p id="line_58">That anxious uneasiness weighed heavily on his heart. Regardless, Leon spoke in his usual cold monotone: “—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> you say? We have not signed an agreement nor asked for any aid. But in the end, he became the hindrance. Still, that’s something that can’t be helped. However, what did you mean by our trade will be suspended? Even if the West has fallen, wouldn’t the East still be operating?”</p>
<p id="line_59">Leon’s sonorous voice echoed in the meeting hall. There was an intense pressure in his voice. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> couldn’t help but feel numb after being hit by his voice head-on.</p>
<p id="line_60">They were on different levels.</p>
<p id="line_61">A half-baked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would have problems just standing still in front of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Even for someone as strong as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it was difficult to deal with Leon.</p>
<p id="line_62">She was not alone here, however.</p>
<p id="line_63">“Allow me to explain,” Laplace interjected. “Things are heating up in the East, actually. They seem to be secretly preparing for war, so their mages are quite occupied. That’s why it’s not as easy to gather people needed for conducting rituals.”</p>
<p id="line_64">Leon squinted at Laplace after listening to what he had to say.</p>
<p id="line_65"><em>How annoying</em>, he thought to himself.</p>
<p id="line_66">He didn’t care about what happened between the Western Nations and the Eastern Empire; but if the war were to be lengthy, it would impact Leon’s goals. If this were to be the case, he would need to re-examine his plans.</p>
<p id="line_67">With that being said, these thoughts were all in Leon’s head. He was still sitting on his throne with a cold expression, silently glaring at Laplace.</p>
<p id="line_68">His gaze made Laplace rather uncomfortable.</p>
<p id="line_69"><em>This guy is definitely a pain in the ass to deal with. He’s nothing like the fake <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> I killed. The real deal really is different, no? Just like Boss said, it’s not gonna be easy to seek revenge against this guy directly…</em></p>
<p id="line_70">Due to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s orders, they had been keeping a low profile. So even with the person who killed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kazalim" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> standing in front of him, Laplace didn’t have the slightest intention to take on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. He was doing so to live up to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s trust. He wanted to do his job well.</p>
<p id="line_71">But, even if that were to be the case—with their archnemesis in front him, he could still try to measure his strength and find his weaknesses. Even in Laplace’s eyes, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. If he were to battle against him seriously… There was no telling who would come out on top. Perhaps he would win, perhaps he would lose. Even if the trio of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and Laplace were to cooperate in challenging him, the winner would still be up for debate.</p>
<p id="line_72">That was why Laplace had been entrusted with the job this time to try and negotiate with Leon. He had also guessed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s intentions for letting them handle this task.</p>
<p id="line_73"><em>Boss wanted us to take a look at this man. It’s important to learn about our enemies.

<p id="line_79"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought was difficult to deal with, was dead. And her source of power—Unique Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Greed" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’—also recognized <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as its new master.</p>
<p id="line_80">That had been <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s true goal. Laplace was shocked after hearing about this. You couldn’t just rob someone else’s Skill; but according to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he had thought that he might be able to.</p>
<p id="line_81"><em>How reckless. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sure was unlucky. Her opponent was our Boss, after all. She was too naive and too confident in her skills. The power of information definitely is amazing. This goes with Leon as well. That’s why even though I’m furious, I shouldn’t take this guy on when I don’t have a good shot at winning. That’s the smart thing to do,</em> Laplace concluded.</p>
<p id="line_82">Suspension of all engagement and focusing on expanding their influence as well as gathering intel—this plan remained the same. Now that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had achieved his goal, there was no reason for them to stay in the Western Nations.</p>
<p id="line_83">This was the reason why they wished to avoid provoking Leon and instead proposed to suspend their trade.</p>
<p id="line_84">It was no use yielding before Leon’s intimidation. Laplace decided to finish his sentence.</p>
<p id="line_85">“We are not saying that there will be no more dealings from now on. When we can conduct summoning rituals once more, we shall contact you, but please be patient until then. Furthermore, our information network spans the whole world. If there were to be any stray otherworlder children, could you permit us to take care of them first?”</p>
<p id="line_86">“—That can’t be helped then. I’ll let you handle that. But I have one question.”</p>
<p id="line_87">“What’s that?”</p>
<p id="line_88">“Why is your tongue so loose?”</p>
<p id="line_89">“Eh?” Laplace replied with confusion, confronted by Leon’s question.</p>
<p id="line_90">He was calling him loose-tongued, yet Laplace didn’t even know what he said wrong.</p>
<p id="line_91"><em>What did I let slip? Never mind that—if he wants to pick a fight, we’ll give him a fight all right.</em></p>
<p id="line_92">Laplace wasn’t nervous in the slightest. You gotta enjoy every situation you were in, or else you’d be a sore loser. Even if he failed, it was fine. He would just see what to do later on.</p>
<p id="line_93">He hid his killing intent and quickly made his resolve. Yet Leon followed up, ignoring Laplace’s conundrum: “Is it really fine for merchants who are sensitive to profits to reveal something as important as war so casually? If this were the previous handler Damrada, surely he wouldn’t have done something so foolish.”</p>
<p id="line_94">“T-that’s…”</p>
<p id="line_95">Now that he pointed it out, even Laplace thought he had a point; but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had ordered him to say this to decline Leon. Moreover, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had revealed other information to him. Now that Laplace recalled it, he began to connect the dots.</p>
<p id="line_96">What Leon would probably say next was—</p>
<p id="line_97">“Are you trying to hide something? You seemed to want to keep my focus on the war. In case you haven’t noticed, that’s a foolishly naive thought,” he threw his doubt at Laplace.</p>
<p id="line_98"><em>We’ve seen through everything.</em> Laplace finally regained his cool, but also felt annoyed at the same time.</p>
<p id="line_99"><em>Seriously, Boss has got me totally beat. He’s even foreseen how things would develop here.</em></p>
<p id="line_100">Leon overanalyzed Laplace’s words and twisted his meaning, thinking that he was hiding something. It was because the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> knew the great value of information that he misunderstood, thinking this was all Laplace’s tactic to distract Leon from other goals.</p>
<p id="line_101">That wasn’t the case at all in reality.</p>
<p id="line_102">Laplace and his companions were merely following <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s orders. They didn’t put much thought to it, but it wouldn’t be helpful to tell the truth now. Leon would probably think that he was just making up excuses. This was all part of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s cleverly crafted plans. In other words, there were great schemes behind what he had done.</p>
<p id="line_103">Naturally, Laplace needed to give a hint regarding their ace in the hole.</p>
<p id="line_104">“How impressive, as expected from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon-sama. Actually, this would be the last of the top-secret merchandise. There were five more. The children who were taken in by Shizue Izawa, to be more specific.”</p>
<p id="line_105">“—Umm.”</p>
<p id="line_106"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wanted to leak the information about the children under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s protection from the start. However, it would have raised Leon’s suspicion about their devious intent if they told him directly. Therefore, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had reminded Laplace time and time again that he should only bring up the children at the end.</p>
<p id="line_107">Depending on how the negotiation went, there was no telling how things would develop. Yet <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> saw through all of this with ease, which was why he was so terrifying.</p>
<p id="line_108">Apart from feeling terrified, Laplace continued to say the words he had been ordered to relay to Leon.</p>
<p id="line_109">“There were three boys and two girls. They were all otherworlders as ya’d ordered. But therein lies the problem: We can’t get them out.”</p>
<p id="line_110">“Shizue Izawa… Shizu, huh? In that case, they are in Tempest?”</p>
<p id="line_111">“Yes. It’s a real pity. We’re merchants too, so we don’t want to get ourselves in trouble. By the way, the children’s names were—”</p>
<p id="line_112">“Ken Misuru, Ryozeki, Gail Gibbs, Alison, Kroba Hale.”</p>
<p id="line_113">The one who spoke in Laplace’s place while he was trying to recall the names was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who had stayed quiet until now. The others figured that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wasn’t the best communicator, so they only let him memorize the names of the children.</p>
<p id="line_114">“Right, right. But since the merchandise can’t be obtained, surely <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon wouldn’t have any interest either,” Laplace uttered with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_115">Yet Leon still scowled.</p>
<p id="line_116">“Your pronunciation made it really hard to tell. Are you sure it is Kroba and not Chloe?”</p>
<p id="line_117"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> remained silent even though Leon asked in a rather annoyed tone. If he were to respond without thinking, Leon would probably be so infuriated as to pick a fight with him. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, by virtue of being here with his group, was putting everyone else in danger. It was the right choice to have had him remain silent; otherwise, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would, no doubt, have only further aggravated Leon.</p>
<p id="line_118"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> apologized in his place.</p>
<p id="line_119">“Please forgive us, His Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. The names of the otherworlders don’t translate well in our tongue. As a result, our pronunciations are not very accurate. Also, we heard that you didn’t particularly care about the names of the travelers. We truly apologize.” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> bowed after apologizing. Laplace and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also bowed dramatically to apologize.</p>
<p id="line_120">“Indeed, names do not matter. It is your miscalculation that the merchandise was taken, but it didn’t violate our contracts. The information about the upcoming war would suffice as your apology, I shall accept it.”</p>
<p id="line_121">Leon swallowed his emotions and announced with his usual attitude.</p>
<p id="line_122">And with that, the meeting concluded.</p>
<p id="line_123">Laplace and the others took the payment for the merchandise and safely left El Dorado.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_124">“All right, what to do next…” Leon muttered to himself after Laplace’s party had departed.</p>
<p id="line_125">The long hair by Leon’s nape gathered neatly together as if it had woven itself into a single brilliant strand of golden light. In sharp contrast to the radiance, his long and slanted eyes were a shade of melancholy.</p>
<p id="line_126">A knight stood ramrod straight next to Leon. He was the silver knight Alrose, one of Leon’s top lieutenants, as well as the person he would often confide in.</p>
<p id="line_127">“Should I eliminate those people just now? How dare they displease Leon-sama like that. I think there is no value in having them live.”</p>
<p id="line_128">Umm—that was the sound that Leon made as he was pondering Alrose’s words.</p>
<p id="line_129">Compared to their predecessor Damrada, those three were more than just suspicious. It was questionable whether they were really merchants at all. Frankly, Leon never trusted merchants from the start. He simply wanted to avoid antagonizing the secret organization ‘Cerberus.’</p>
<p id="line_130">Leon’s subordinates had integrated into human society as well, but they were nowhere near this enormous organization based in the ‘East’ that had even exerted influence on the ‘West.’</p>
<p id="line_131"><em>We should use them while they are still exploitable</em>—Leon judged calmly.</p>
<p id="line_132">Especially with the ordeal of finding ‘Otherworlders,’ as opposed to having <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> searching for them, it was more appropriate to have humans handle the work. In order to achieve his goal, assistance from humans was necessary.</p>
<p id="line_133">“Let them be. More importantly, the problem lies with the information those guys just leaked. If the Eastern Empire really were on the move, it would lead to a real world war. I’m not sure what the other <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s would do, but if the world went to chaos, there is no way that we would not be affected.”</p>
<p id="line_134">“It is as you say,” Alrose affirmed in agreement. “El Dorado is under Leon-sama’s protection, but other places may be subjected to the massive scale of war. We must arrange preparations for it.”</p>
<p id="line_135">Leon’s ruled territory, El Dorado, lay on a different continent across the sea. This continent was larger than the country of Australia on Earth. All of it was under Leon’s rule.</p>
<p id="line_136">There was a large active volcano in the center that erupted all year round. Yet the volcanic dust was blown away by magic-controlled wind and never once fell over the beautiful capital city. There were also all sorts of ore deposits near the volcano that could be processed into valuable magical metals. In addition, the high yield of gold made it possible for Leon to conduct secret trade with humans.</p>
<p id="line_137">The city was extremely prosperous. The kingdom was protected by magic. This was the golden valley of El Dorado under Leon’s rule.</p>
<p id="line_138">There was no way that this prosperous kingdom would be affected and subjected to the ugly wars of humans—this probably was not just Alrose’s wish, but the wishes of all of Leon’s subjects.</p>
<p id="line_139">“Then we should cast defensive magic for emergency use; enter a high alert state.”</p>
<p id="line_140">“Very well, we should do just that. But it is beyond my control.”</p>
<p id="line_141">“…? What is?”</p>
<p id="line_142">“The war. If many were to die, it may bring those troublesome creatures to the world. I recall that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yellow Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> slumbers within this land. But it probably wouldn’t be enough to grant it a new body…”</p>
<p id="line_143">Leon was truly annoyed by the idiocy that was being committed. He had no idea what the Eastern Empire was planning, but death always accompanied war. If large amounts of blood were spilled, the seas of blood would awaken <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It may just cause those dangerous <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to be awakened and rain catastrophe upon mankind.</p>
<p id="line_144">Leon had a very special standing in all this as an ex-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. To him, such a move was extremely foolish.</p>
<p id="line_145">However—</p>
<p id="line_146">Now that he had become a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he simply felt that it was rather saddening. Even though he pitied the humans outside, it wouldn’t really hurt him, regardless of what would happen to these outsiders.</p>
<p id="line_147">Leon had only one thing on his mind. He feared about the possibility that the girl he was finding might be harmed by this whole ordeal.</p>
<p id="line_148">“We shall let them witness our strength by that time!”</p>
<p id="line_149">“Very well. I look forward to your performance. In addition—”</p>
<p id="line_150">“Allow me to send members of the Blue Knight Order to his kingdom.”</p>
<p id="line_151">Leon nodded steadily to Alrose.</p>
<p id="line_152">There was no need to give orders in detail, Alrose knew what he meant and had put it into action.</p>
<p id="line_153">“I’ll leave it to you,” Leon declared, then calmly closed his eyes—</p>
<p id="line_154">As his subordinate left, the meeting hall fell back into silence.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_155">Leon’s slanted eyes opened and gazed into the empty space.</p>
<p id="line_156"><em>—Speaking of which, did he just say Kroba Hale? I shouldn’t expect much, but is it seriously that similar? Perhaps it’s a trap.</em></p>
<p id="line_157">No, it didn’t matter if it was a trap or not.</p>

<p id="line_163">“I see, it appears that everything has been going smoothly,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kagurazaka said happily after hearing the report.</p>
<p id="line_164">“Everything was just like the boss predicted! I was starting to suspect that Laplace had failed.”</p>
<p id="line_165">“Hehehe, Laplace is always cautious. But he’s not good with negotiations.”</p>
<p id="line_166">“Eh, hold on. I’m way better at that than ya guys!”</p>
<p id="line_167"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were tacit under these circumstances, to which Laplace voiced his complaint. It wasn’t actual complaining, but more like friendly banter between close friends.</p>
<p id="line_168">“Don’t be mad; it’s not that bad. I’m glad about the fact that you were all able to hold back when facing Leon,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> admitted.</p>
<p id="line_169">“Right. To be fair, I also prepared a mental note for myself in case you guys did lose control,” added <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, smirking as he finished.</p>
<p id="line_170">If that were to really happen, they would need to see how things developed. At most, they would only lose a way to communicate with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. Now that they’ve decided to no longer operate among the Western Nations, it was no longer that big an issue.</p>
<p id="line_171">“Yer truly ruthless. By the way, did ya have something planned when ya let me tell Leon about the kids?” Laplace asked, sounding resigned.</p>
<p id="line_172">“No, there was nothing too significant behind that. To be honest, Leon’s goal of gathering these incomplete summons was probably to expand his military force. On the other hand, I <em>am</em> concerned about whether or not he has some other intention,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> replied with a wry smile on his face.</p>
<p id="line_173">“So that’s why you revealed the truth and told him about the five children under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s protection…”</p>
<p id="line_174">“There’s more to it than that. After all, what Leon did with those children is only based on our assumptions. By design, incomplete summons—children—would inevitably die. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> saved those kids and granted them the power of spirits. Leon didn’t know about it. I’m more interested in what that guy will do now that he’s learned about the existence of those children who are supposed to die soon.”</p>
<p id="line_175">“I see. That is certainly intriguing. We can see the reason behind Leon’s actions by simply observing his reaction.”</p>
<p id="line_176">“That’s true. After all, there haven’t been that many clues, so we need a stimulant of some kind.”</p>
<p id="line_177">“Don’t we now? But for the most part, I just did it out of curiosity. I’m always very mindful of details.”</p>
<p id="line_178">After listening to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s explanation, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Laplace both understood what he meant. Indeed, perhaps just as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said, this was him erring on the side of caution. He wanted to explore Leon’s intentions, but more importantly, the deliberate leaking of information had some significant meaning behind it.</p>
<p id="line_179">What if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon decided to take action?</p>
<p id="line_180">Leon wouldn’t go to war with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> for the sake of adding a mere five soldiers. The risk of antagonizing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> far outweighed the benefits of his attempt at increasing military strength. Leon wasn’t stupid enough that he’d fail to realize this.</p>
<p id="line_181">Under normal circumstances, he would write off the loss of those kids, but if Leon took actions regardless of the cost—</p>
<p id="line_182">Then they could come to the definite conclusion: Leon had some other motive.</p>
<p id="line_183">“But—they’re just a couple of kids. I don’t think <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon will take any action,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> remarked.</p>
<p id="line_184">Laplace frowned. “Seriously? We even had to leak information about the war just so we could mention those kids. My nerves were killing me after he became suspicious. It took a lot of effort to work that out.”</p>
<p id="line_185">Things would undoubtedly get interesting if Leon were to respond. But the probability of that happening was very low.</p>

If you guys didn’t go in that direction, revealing the children’s information would just seem unnatural. Also, if you revealed it from the start, with your acting skills…”</p>
<p id="line_188"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> tried to play dumb.</p>
<p id="line_189">He didn’t plan on finishing his sentence. Laplace and the others knew all too well themselves with what he wanted to say.</p>
<p id="line_190"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> put it plainly for everyone. “While regretful, it’s something that can’t be helped. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s not good with making speeches, nor is his temper.

<p id="line_191">Laplace was left dumbfounded whereas <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked all pissed off.

<p id="line_192">“Boss, you can call me paranoid, but there’s something bugging me.”</p>
<p id="line_193">“Oh—what is it?”</p>
<p id="line_194">“Here’s the thing.

<p id="line_195">“What did Leon do?”</p>
<p id="line_196">“He kept asking about the names afterward.

<p id="line_197">“That man looked a bit sensitive; no doubt he cares about little details like that.”</p>
<p id="line_198">“Hehehe, that guy was really pissing me off. He was probably making fun of me for my pronunciation.”</p>

<p id="line_210">And if that honestly were the case, then maybe they wouldn’t have lost Clayman—she was infuriated by this knowledge.</p>
<p id="line_211">“Eh, EH!”</p>
<p id="line_212">Seeing that her words had inspired such an unexpected possibility, even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> couldn’t hide her surprise.

<p id="line_246">I’ve been busy every day now that I returned to the capital of Tempest, or more commonly known as ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’</p>
<p id="line_247">I knew for sure that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was dead.</p>
<p id="line_248">When the dust had settled, I ordered people to head down the ruins and investigate, yet no body or items of value were found.</p>
<p id="line_249">She probably died from the explosion when she self-detonated that engine reactor like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> claimed, or maybe it was all smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p id="line_250">Regardless, every problem had been resolved regarding the issue.</p>
<p id="line_251"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the princess of the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Siltrosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The princess attacked us in the ruins—if we were to publicly announce this bit of news, it would only make matters worse. That was why we secretly contacted the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Siltrosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and regarded the matter as an “accident” that unfortunately occurred.</p>
<p id="line_252">The fact that we were able to negotiate at all was because neither country wanted the incident to be in the public eye. We were both well aware of the ramifications, hence the open cooperation. There were always plenty of “accidents” when it came to royalty with deep, historical roots. We quickly reached an agreement and did not escalate further conflict.</p>
<p id="line_253">Their king and queen appeared to be very cruel and ruthless.</p>
<p id="line_254">With parents like that, it was no wonder <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wanted to rely on knowledge from her previous life.</p>
<p id="line_255"><em>If she had the chance to happily live out a brand-new life as a naive child, would she have turned out any differently?</em> With that being said, that was just an afterthought.</p>
<p id="line_256">Let us check on the Five Great Elders now.</p>
<p id="line_257">The head of the Five Great Elders, the one that instigated <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, was the leader of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> family, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I put myself on guard thinking that he would be plotting something, but it was surprisingly not the case. I suppose that was the right move. It would’ve been a public acknowledgement of their illegal doings had he acted in some way. As long as we also stay quiet, they wouldn’t be able to do anything.</p>
<p id="line_258">In fact, more than a month had passed since the incident. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had been completely quiet the entire time.</p>
<p id="line_259">This brief break still gave us plenty of time.</p>
<p id="line_260">We effectively utilized information collected by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to gain intelligence regarding the underbelly of the Western Nations. We realized that there was no bigger threat than the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> family.</p>
<p id="line_261">For instance, their friendly relationship with the mercenary band ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Apostles of Verte" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ but we also discovered several organizations that we had to keep our eyes on. However, it was still unclear as to whether my policies and interests had any direct conflict with them.</p>
<p id="line_262">Unless they openly declared a hostile attitude towards us, we had no reason to retaliate. I didn’t want to stir up trouble myself. For now, we only needed to observe their every move.</p>
<p id="line_263">Furthermore, we were on good terms with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. We also had the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as our benefactor. It wasn’t unreasonable to say that there shouldn’t be a single organization out there that would dare to oppose us. As a result, Tempest became the largest faction within the Western Council.</p>
<p id="line_264">It was now a peaceful early afternoon.</p>
<p id="line_265">As per usual, we organized a meeting among the executives.</p>
<p id="line_266">In a short period of time, we had virtually replaced the Five Great Elders. Probably that was why a whole new set of problems suddenly appeared, most likely a direct consequence of their absence.</p>
<p id="line_267">The Western Council undoubtedly played an important role in directing the decisions of the Western Nations.</p>
<p id="line_268">Inside the council, the councilors of each nation would cast their vote to decide whether a motion passed or not. The diplomatic weight of a nation’s words corresponded to the number of councilors they had. Since we learned about the weaknesses of each nation in the council, our councilor will have to take on the role of mediator.</p>
<p id="line_269">As our influence on the Western Nations gradually grew, complaints and petitions from other countries inevitably increased.</p>
<p id="line_270">It was like they were saying “It won’t cost you your life just by expressing your opinion,” which emboldened people to give us all sorts of requests.</p>
<p id="line_271">That was why conquering the world was nothing but a fool’s errand.</p>
<p id="line_272">Being a ruler was definitely not easy. It was no wonder why the other <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s weren’t interested in other people’s territories at all.</p>
<p id="line_273">If they accidentally received a tract of impoverished land, they would have to figure out a way to alleviate the local populace’s dissatisfaction. Reducing the wealth gap was easy to talk about in theory, but for the person actually handling the mess, it was a difficult job.</p>
<p id="line_274">Each region’s total capital was made up of their inherent resources and labor within. I believed the proper way to resolve the wealth gap issue was to cut down on costs, calculate the resulting profits, and redistribute them.</p>
<p id="line_275">On the other hand, we needed to be cautious with subsidizing local regions.</p>
<p id="line_276">If we didn’t handle the matter appropriately, it would become a breeding ground for grievances.</p>
<p id="line_277">Now that our nation was the largest faction in the council, we were expected to behave accordingly. While organizations that opposed us were being contained right now, it was only a matter of time before they began rising up again.</p>
<p id="line_278">Then there was the problem of who we should send to the council.</p>
<p id="line_279">This person needed to be socially adept and possess a certain degree of charisma.</p>
<p id="line_280">But at the same time, when conflicts arose, they also needed to be intimidating enough to keep others from talking back…</p>
<p id="line_281">“First things first, I want to apologize for having to turn down this task,” I announced.</p>
<p id="line_282"><em>After all, the early bird gets the worm.</em></p>
<p id="line_283">It was rare that I considered myself to be devious, but even I didn’t want to take the initiative on this hot mess.</p>
<p id="line_284"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> followed in my footsteps. “Me neither. The last meeting made me realize that my personality is not suited for trying to probe other people. When I am not on the battlefield where my martial prowess can be displayed, I won’t be of much use.”</p>
<p id="line_285">While he sounded too modest, what he said probably was genuine too. Indeed, those sly nobles would be too much of a hassle for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to handle.</p>
<p id="line_286">Likewise, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also rejected the job. “My duty is to collect information. As the ‘eyes and ears’ of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I’m afraid I can’t abandon my position right now.”</p>
<p id="line_287">Well, I somewhat guessed that already. I didn’t want to send <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as well.</p>
<p id="line_288"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wouldn’t do either.</p>
<p id="line_289">Although he had good morals and was a very reliable man, the current work assigned to him was more important.</p>
<p id="line_290">Due to the large number of construction projects that were lined up, he had no free time on his busy schedule. I figured that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be perfect at handling the councilors, but right now, I definitely had to remove him from the list of potential candidates.</p>
<p id="line_291"><em>In that case</em>…</p>
<p id="line_292">“W-will you be sending me?”</p>
<p id="line_293">At that moment, I glanced at the source of the question and saw <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who was attending the meeting with a serious expression on his face.</p>
<p id="line_294">He’s surprisingly self-aware, so he probably wouldn’t turn down such an important role.</p>
<p id="line_295">…No, I should say that I felt pretty uneasy, but I couldn’t think of any other suitable candidates.</p>
<p id="line_296">I already made <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> our military advisor and asked him to train our soldiers.</p>
<p id="line_297">As for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, while having her as our councilor was a possible solution, doing so would doubtlessly have a negative impact on the overall affairs of the country.</p>
<p id="line_298">Based on the same rationale, I naturally couldn’t send Rigurd and the other Goblin chiefs.</p>
<p id="line_299">As a newborn nation, we needed to draft our laws and negotiate with other governments. There were also other problems such as managing an increasing population. The chiefs would handle these challenges first, but without the support of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Rigurd, all of these affairs would sadly have to be put on hold.</p>
<p id="line_300">Even though they were the ones nurturing the next generation, there was always room for improvement and development.</p>
<p id="line_301">“I-I want to tame the wyverns that were captured and use them as mounts in order to strengthen our air force. This training would require a huge consumption of all sorts of potions, so I still want to continue collecting data…”</p>
<p id="line_302">Umm—that’s right.</p>
<p id="line_303">As the saying went, ‘the right person for the job,’ I believed that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s talents were a perfect match for what he had suggested.</p>
<p id="line_304">As opposed to forcing him to attend the council, I would rather have him focus on raising wyvern troops.</p>
<p id="line_305">“All right. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you should continue to handle the matter.”</p>
<p id="line_306">He gave an expression of relief. “Yes sir! Understood!”</p>
<p id="line_307">It’s no good forcing tasks down other people’s throats, which was why I thought this was the correct choice.</p>
<p id="line_308">But even so, the growth of our domain was too fast. It was a bad idea to expand our reach before we’ve even nurtured our talents, but the number of jobs we had to deal with was increasing at an unstoppable rate.</p>
<p id="line_309">It was very troubling.</p>
<p id="line_310"><em>It can’t be helped, I guess. Let’s try to think of other alternatives.</em></p>
<p id="line_311">—Just when I was starting to brainstorm.</p>
<p id="line_312">My gaze suddenly locked onto <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who was staring at me with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p id="line_314">“No!”</p>
<p id="line_315">I immediately cut <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> off.</p>

<p id="line_318"><em>Jeez,</em> I’m <em>the one who’s surprised by your reaction.</em></p>
<p id="line_319">“Let’s think of a scenario. This is only an example, but let’s say you’re a councilor. There’s a lascivious old man with a big belly in front of you. He’s a councilor, too. And then, that old man gently places his hand on your shoulder like he’s a very close friend. Now, how will you react?”</p>
<p id="line_320">“It’s obvious. I grab that man’s neck with my left hand, lift him up, and punch him without hesitation! I gotta hit him!!”</p>
<p id="line_321"><em>‘I gotta hit him!’ isn’t the answer!!</em></p>
<p id="line_322">That’s why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was out of the question.</p>

<p id="line_328">What I felt right then was definitely a bad feeling.</p>
<p id="line_329">But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had learned to brew a delicious cup of black tea. Because of that knowledge, I let my guard down.</p>
<p id="line_330">“O-oh. Thank you. Then let’s try it.”</p>
<p id="line_331">After saying that, I accepted it without much thought.</p>
<p id="line_332">It was a mistake.</p>
<p id="line_333">On the plate was a big chunk of what looked like a Konjac.</p>
<p id="line_334">I suddenly became grave.</p>
<p id="line_335"><em>Eh, what cake…?</em></p>
<p id="line_336">After looking at that object, I glanced around for help.</p>
<p id="line_337">Nobody was there. Did they all run away?</p>
<p id="line_338">No, Gobichi was lying down in the kitchen. He was definitely a victim.</p>
<p id="line_339">I realized that I had come in at the worst possible time, but it was already too late.</p>
<p id="line_340">“Oi…is this a cake?”</p>
<p id="line_341">“Yes! The taste was perfectly reproduced!”</p>
<p id="line_342"><em>The taste is perfect?</em></p>
<p id="line_343"><em>Doesn’t that just mean everything else is awful…?</em></p>
<p id="line_344"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was very confident. And looking at that pleased face only caused my uneasiness to increase. While regretting my own foolishness, I decided to take a bite. I took a spoonful and brought it in my mouth. I didn’t need to say much more about the results.</p>
<p id="line_345">I thought I was going to throw up.</p>
<p id="line_346">The texture was Konjac. But the taste was sweet cake.</p>
<p id="line_347">It had a gray color, and just like its appearance, it felt as if I was chewing on Konjac.</p>
<p id="line_348">It was then that I realized how important visual information was with a cake.</p>
<p id="line_349">No, it wasn’t something limited only to cakes. With cooking, appearance was also essential to enjoyment. Even if the ingredients are served as is, they do not look delicious.</p>
<p id="line_350">“How is it? Doesn’t it taste good?”</p>
<p id="line_351">I was annoyed looking at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s proud face, as if she wanted to declare, “It’s perfect, right?”</p>
<p id="line_352">From the beginning, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t know the basics.</p>
<p id="line_353">The very first step—“What is cooking”—she had made zero progress on this rudimentary stage.</p>
<p id="line_354">“Sit down. Sit there for a moment. I have to scold you a bit!”</p>

She was taken aback and didn’t know what to do, but I didn’t care and started lecturing her.</p>
<p id="line_357">For about thirty minutes, and in earnest.</p>
<p id="line_358">I talked to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> about what cooking really was so she could understand.

<p class="space-break" id="line_359">—Something like that happened.</p>
<p id="line_360">Then, I remembered something after I scolded <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

It was hard to improve yourself like that.</p>
<p id="line_362">We needed someone to act as a chaperone for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_363">As a result, there was no way I could appoint <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as a councilor. If she were to cause a problem at the council, it could harm the friendly relationship we just established with humanity.

<p id="line_364">For example, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_365">“I think <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would do well,” I mumbled, sharing my true feelings.</p>
<p id="line_366">When that happened, the executives all together nodded.</p>
<p id="line_367">“Hmm, if it is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono, then I feel relieved.”</p>
<p id="line_368">“I’m sure he would be able to convince those nobles into doing whatever we want.”</p>

<p id="line_372">“With his wits and resourcefulness, I think we would be able to progress things the way <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama wants.”</p>
<p id="line_373">“Although I feel upset, Second Secretary (<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>) is excellent.

<p id="line_374">Everyone seemed to approve of appointing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as our councilor. It felt like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had some kind of ulterior motive, yet there was no doubt that she recognized <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s talent.</p>
<p id="line_375">There were no opposing opinions.</p>
<p id="line_376">Since there weren’t really any other good ideas, for this case, we concluded with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> being the leading candidate.</p>

<p id="line_379">We decided to postpone our meeting.</p>
<p id="line_380">No, until someone was selected, attending the council would have to be my job. I wanted to make a final ruling on a replacement, and so I hoped <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would return soon.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_381">It was an urgent matter, but <em>I</em> was the one who was seriously troubled by all this. The outcome depended on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s return, which meant the meeting had a rather unnoteworthy end.</p>
<p id="line_382">Peace was the best. Having no problems was a good thing. Being able to enjoy your free time was awesome.</p>
<p id="line_383">Therefore, I decided to go look for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And thanks to recently having some free time, I found something that had been weighing on my mind.</p>
<p id="line_384">I went into the workshop and called for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_385">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-kun! Are you free right now?”</p>
<p id="line_386">I greeted the disciples, who were bowing to show their respect when they saw me, with a wave and went inside the back room. There, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had several swords laid out, deep in thought about something.</p>
<p id="line_387">“Ohh, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama? You came at a good time. I have something to report.”</p>
<p id="line_388">“Hmm, something to report to me? What happened?”</p>
<p id="line_389">If it was something he needed to inform me about, perhaps he completed a new piece of work. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had been bringing my ideas to fruition, often developing them together with Kaijin, so I thought maybe he made another useful thing.</p>
<p id="line_390">My assumption turned out to be true.</p>
<p id="line_391">“It’s about the weapon mechanism you requested a while ago. It’s finally complete!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> exclaimed, pointing at the assortment of differently shaped swords that were spread out in front of me.</p>
<p id="line_392">Seeing his happy expression, I could immediately tell that this was something truly astonishing.</p>
<p id="line_393">But what was it that I requested?</p>
<p id="line_394">There were so many spur-of-the-moment ideas I told him about that I couldn’t pinpoint which exact one he was referring to.</p>
<p id="line_395">Whatever the case may be, I’d probably find out more if I appraised it.</p>
<p id="line_396">«Answer. Weapon: broadsword—the classification is unique-grade.»</p>
<p id="line_397"><em>Ohhh, it’s unique-grade.</em></p>
<p id="line_398">This was crafted by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as well, so it must be of excellent quality. However, I doubted that was the only reason why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had such a proud expression on his face. With his level of skill, he could have easily made several unique-grade items in the span of a single month. If <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was forging a normal sword, then he only needed a day to finish it.</p>
<p id="line_399">The average quality was unique-grade, and even if it was a failure, it still fell under the category of being one of the best rare-grade items. If he invested a lot of effort, it would require about two or three days, but in those cases, the classification was guaranteed to be at least unique-grade. I think he’s still far away from being able to complete a legendary-grade item, but since it was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I believed he would eventually accomplish it.</p>
<p id="line_400">Furthermore, if skilled masters kept constantly using the weapons crafted by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I had a hunch that they could evolve to become legendary-grade.</p>
<p id="line_401">It was crucial to start the process off right by carefully selecting materials, like utilizing high purity magisteel. The weapons comprehend and evolve alongside the user’s will, so I thought it wouldn’t be long before we saw the birth of a legendary-grade weapon that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> made. Therefore, I figured that there was no reason for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to go out of his way to show me a unique-grade weapon, but…</p>
<p id="line_402">I inspected that broadsword a little more carefully.</p>
<p id="line_403">A distinctive feature were the small holes—three of them, to be precise—the size of a marble located at the base of the blade.</p>
<p id="line_404">Apart from that, there was nothing else that caught my eye.</p>
<p id="line_405">Of course, the quality was fairly satisfactory for a sword. It was a different story had this been the work of a disciple, yet compared to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s other works, it didn’t seem very remarkable. It felt a little weird saying this, but it was an extremely ordinary-looking unique-grade weapon.</p>
<p id="line_406">It didn’t appear to really have any special ‘Engraving Magic’ either… Wait, could this be?</p>
<p id="line_407">“What is this? Although unique-grade is certainly remarkable, it isn’t rare for you to get that classification, right?” I asked, feigning confusion while I hid my inner agitation.</p>
<p id="line_408">“Have you forgotten by any chance? Ufufufu, this is an unbelievable thing. At a quick glance, it looks like an ordinary weapon and doesn’t have any magical effects. Yet, it has an incredible characteristic.”</p>
<p id="line_409">Even with my—or rather, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s—‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ I couldn’t detect anything unusual at all. If this really was what I thought it was, then the possibilities could be truly promising.</p>
<p id="line_410">In front of me, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who could hardly contain his excitement, brought out some kind of glowing ball. He then casually fitted it into a random slot.</p>
<p id="line_411">“You place the ball like this into the hole on the slotted sword. If you do that—”</p>
<p id="line_412">«Report. Weapon: broadsword has changed into Magic Weapon: broadsword.»</p>
<p id="line_413"><em>Ah, I knew it!!</em></p>
<p id="line_414">An ordinary weapon had changed into a magic weapon. In other words, it meant that the idea I had been fantasizing about had ultimately come to fruition.</p>
<p id="line_415">“Woooah!! Is it finally complete?”</p>
<p id="line_416">“Ufufu, as expected of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, you’ve realized it too?

<p id="line_417"><em>That’s right. I’ve definitely brought up that idea in the past.</em></p>
<p id="line_418">I knew that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had been steadily researching, but the thought of him succeeding this quickly never crossed my mind.</p>

<p id="line_420">He was a reserved man who didn’t feel the need to boast about his accomplishments; his work was more than sufficient enough to eloquently describe his prowess. He was a true example of a master craftsman.</p>
<p id="line_421">“He-hey, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-chan!

<p id="line_423">“Mufufufu, I did it!”</p>
<p id="line_424">He had a smug look.</p>
<p id="line_425">But it wasn’t often you saw a smug face as handsome as his. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s smugness annoyed me, but unlike her, I honestly wanted to praise <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_426">There were several ways of crafting magic gear.</p>
<p id="line_427">I could utilize the ‘Synthesis and Separation’ of ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ to affix magical effects to equipment. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could do the same thing; on the other hand, Kaijin and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciples were not capable of such an overpowered skill.</p>
<p id="line_428"><em>Then, you may ask, what will they do to achieve the same effect?</em></p>
<p id="line_429">Normally speaking, they would achieve the same result by having an engraving mage cast ‘Engraving Magic.’ Dold was a skillful user of said magic and could easily cast it onto weapons.</p>
<p id="line_430">Engraved magic gear could be infused with mana, and once infused, it was possible to execute certain magic. However, there was a limit to the number of varying magics that could be enchanted. At most, only two types of different magic could be enchanted. Moreover, it was impossible to remove the engraving after enchanting.</p>
<p id="line_431">I figured that I had mentioned this plenty of times, but there was another method, and that was through the evolution of weapons. The weapons could be given special properties through the user’s mana.</p>
<p id="line_432">It wasn’t an easy thing to achieve, and it usually took an exceptionally long time. However, the growth of the weapons would often develop unexpected power. Thus, this could be one of our research projects to see if there was a more efficient way to cause weapon evolutions.</p>
<p id="line_433">We had acquired a large amount of unique-grade equipment from the ancient ruins of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Amalita" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and supplied part of them as research material. Research like that would not yield results so easily, so we would have to be persistent on the matter.</p>
<p id="line_434">Next, let’s check out some of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s work.</p>
<p id="line_435">These were some products that subverted conventional concepts.</p>
<p id="line_436">Kaijin, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I had been drinking one time when an idea suddenly came to us.</p>
<p id="line_437">We would use magisteel, since it was a great conductor of mana, to craft hardened weapons. In addition, we also planned to prepare an item that can be used as a ‘Core’ to cast magic. That way, we might be able to create magic gear that didn’t have fixed magic anchored in them.</p>
<p id="line_438">For instance, what would happen if we fitted a sword with spirit magic stones?</p>
<p id="line_439">The answer was…the same effect as the slotted swords—those weapons with holes in the base of their blade. And, the slotted swords weren’t going to use magic stones, but rather jewels that had much higher purity.</p>
<p id="line_440">“So, is it close to what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama had envisioned? As you can see, I’ve managed to craft these slotted weapons. Kaijin-san also discovered a way of condensing magicule concentration in order to craft high-purity magic crystals!”</p>
<p id="line_441"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sure had a lot to show off.</p>
<p id="line_442">It looked like Kaijin really took part in the research effort. While <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> crafted the weapons, Kaijin crafted the marbles. It was no wonder how they were able to successfully create something this wonderful since the two of them had joined hands.</p>
<p id="line_443">“Regarding the magic stones that provide these properties, we’ve named them ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Spirit Core" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ We’ve also been calling them ‘Magic Marble.’ When <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was out catching wyverns, Vesta-san, who was taking a break from work, also joined us. I heard that those two were already researching the power core of the ‘Spirit Magic Core.’ Basically, they already possessed the technology to enchant magic stones with the earth, water, fire, and wind spirits,” explained <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_444">I recalled Ramiris mentioning that the ‘Spirit Magic Core’ was meant to ensure all the spirits were activated at the same time. Kaijin and the others were doing similar research in the past, so crafting a single-spirit magic stone was a piece of cake for them.</p>
<p id="line_445">All he had to do was adjust the size and power output of the magic marbles. With the properties of the magic power imbued in them, they became ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Spirit Core" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s,’ which could be classified into four elements—earth, water, fire, or wind.</p>
<p id="line_446">Naturally, the energy of these cores would run out. Once the magic contained within was depleted, they would be no different than purely decorative marbles. However, they could be recycled for repeated use.</p>
<p id="line_447">“Can we replenish their energy?” I asked.</p>
<p id="line_448">“We can. Although, we will need to find skillful mages to infuse our magic in it. It’s not something an amateur can handle.”</p>
<p id="line_449">“I see. Perhaps we could create some new jobs by assigning some workshops to specifically infuse magic for other people, too.”</p>
<p id="line_450">“That’s right. I think it will be a good idea to prepare as many magic marbles as possible. That way, we could also start trading these marbles.”</p>
<p id="line_451">That was indeed the case.</p>
<p id="line_452">I was planning to mix these magic marbles into the items dropped by the labyrinth <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. With that being said, these marbles could be a sort of new commodity on their own as well.</p>
<p id="line_453">Yet, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wasn’t finished. “Nonetheless, it’s best that we be cautious. These magic marbles are still in the experimental stage, and their properties could change depending on their combinations.”</p>
<p id="line_454">“Combinations?”</p>
<p id="line_455">What did he mean?</p>
<p id="line_456"><em>‘Their properties could change’…could it be?!</em></p>
<p id="line_457">“Please take a look at this. There are three empty slots on this blade.”</p>
<p id="line_458"><em>I knew it!</em></p>
<p id="line_459">“In other words, if you put two magic marbles with different spirits in them, you would get some unexpected properties?”</p>
<p id="line_460">“That’s right!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> agreed with my speculation.</p>
<p id="line_461">Then that would complicate things.</p>
<p id="line_462">We would have to experiment more to verify these properties. Such innovative technology should not be published without a second thought.</p>
<p id="line_463">«Negative. All information used in the labyrinth can be managed.»</p>
<p id="line_464"><em>Oh, oh oh.</em></p>
<p id="line_465"><em>I see how it is now.</em></p>
<p id="line_466">This way, we could save the time and effort of experimenting, and in addition, it would eliminate any possible security issues since it was within the labyrinth. Now that I thought about it, the best approach was if we asked the labyrinth challengers for help in order to get a large pool of verified data.</p>
<p id="line_467">Even if they managed to find some incredible discoveries, the only people capable of recreating this technology were probably from our nation. While I still had my reservations about our technology being leaked, since we planned to commercialize it, then it was only a matter of time. And if that was the case, then the smarter move was to at least carry out the experiment in a venue that we could overlook.</p>
<p id="line_468">“Right, so what kind of dangers are you expecting?”</p>
<p id="line_469">“It depends on the number of holes to the number of inserted magic marbles. It’s fine if there is only one slot. However, if you put a wind spirit next to a fire spirit, the overall magic power intensifies. In contrast, a water spirit combined with a fire spirit reduces power. Even so, one water spirit marble paired with two fire spirit marbles results in a dramatic spike in power. This is not power increasing by a factor of three we are talking about here, but a spike ten times more powerful than the original. That’s why I figured we should collect more test results. I’ve discussed the matter with Kaijin-san too.”</p>
<p id="line_470">By the looks of things, there were plenty of hazardous combinations. Magic marbles genuinely required some experimentation. It would be a huge project.</p>
<p id="line_471">I should listen to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei’s suggestion and carry out the research in the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_472">“Is three the maximum number of slots a weapon can carry?”</p>
<p id="line_473">“Yes. Regardless of how hard we tried, we could only support up to three for now.”</p>
<p id="line_474">Moreover, the chances of successfully punching three holes was apparently one in one hundred. It was only when <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> devoted his entire strength and swung his whole body that the potential of forging a three-holed weapon appeared.</p>
<p id="line_475">Naturally, it was next to impossible for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciples to craft slotted weapons. Just four of his best students managed to craft a single slotted weapon.</p>
<p id="line_476">By the way, even Kaijin was limited to a two-holed weapon. This goes to show how immensely difficult it was to successfully create these slotted weapons.</p>
<p id="line_477">“Right now, we can only craft three-holed weapons. Despite that, with the right combination of magic marbles, they can give off the same power as a legendary-grade weapon,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> proudly revealed.</p>
<p id="line_478">Under normal circumstances, magic swords were already extremely precious and treasured items. If their properties could be altered at will, such an invention would undoubtedly defy all common sense. If you could switch up the properties of your magic weapon depending on your enemies’ weaknesses—then they had honestly crafted something incredible.</p>
<p id="line_479">Its value was priceless. Just like what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> mentioned, these weapons could rival legendary-grade weapons. Furthermore, with the right combinations, some might really give off the power of legendary-grade weapons. This was truly unbelievable. I gave my sincere praise from the bottom of my heart to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others.</p>
<p id="line_480">After discussing the matter with him, we decided to prioritize dispatching the completed slotted weapons to the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_481">We also intended to manufacture a large quantity of one-time use magic marbles and scatter them within the labyrinth’s treasure chests. In addition, once <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciples learned how to craft slotted weapons, then they would be incorporated as rewards for defeating the labyrinth bosses, too.</p>
<p id="line_482">It wasn’t easy making three-holed weapons; however, it might be doable if we loosened the requirements on quality control. We could achieve this by reducing their durability and lowering the weapon grades.</p>
<p id="line_483">“Would that work?”</p>
<p id="line_484">“I believe it would. Although, it will definitely be fragile, so I don’t recommend using it in actual battles…”</p>
<p id="line_485"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t seem to agree, as he answered rather timidly.</p>
<p id="line_486">With that being said, I believed that they would at least be able to endure our experiments.</p>
<p id="line_487">In my opinion, we merely needed to verify the various combinations of magic marbles. That was why I had hoped <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and his disciples could mass produce two or more holed weapons and distribute them to the labyrinth challengers.</p>
<p id="line_488">Moreover, those challengers were no fools. Only amateurs would rely solely on unfamiliar and mysterious weapons that they found. There would not be a problem as long as the challengers were able to tell the difference between their main weapons and disposable weapons and use them accordingly. In teams that lacked a mage, these weapons could be a real treasure, which was why they were an important experimental case to study.</p>
<p id="line_489">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, that’s one evil expression you are making.”</p>
<p id="line_490">“Hahaha, you are overthinking things, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-kun!”</p>
<p id="line_491">“Then I shall hurry and teach my disciples the techniques.”</p>
<p id="line_492">After saying so, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> agreed to my request on increasing the quantity.</p>
<p id="line_493">The plan was quickly finalized now that he had voiced his support.</p>
<p id="line_494">Even though the project would consume quite a bit of magisteel, it could be considered a form of training for his disciples. We would be able to test out these potentially battleworthy products.</p>
<p id="line_495">I decided to make these weapons the official equipment for centurions and higher-ranked officers. By considering their weaknesses and issuing the correct combination of marbles, their combat abilities could be raised.</p>
<p id="line_496">“I’ll be counting on you then!”</p>
<p id="line_497">“Understood!”</p>
<p id="line_498">And so, I left the matter in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s care.</p>

<p id="line_506">My sword wasn’t bent nor shattered, and was completely familiar with my mana.</p>

<p id="line_518">“T-this…what in the world is this? I can’t even analyze it…”</p>
<p id="line_519">“I think it is called something like hihiirokane?”</p>
<p id="line_520">“Hihiirokane? D-does something like that really exist? It’s said to be a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> metal that possesses immutable properties. I honestly thought it was something of a fairy tale…”</p>
<p id="line_521"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was no longer just excited. He was stunned speechless.</p>
<p id="line_522">I figured that this change would be powerful, but it seemed to have exceeded my expectations. Afterward, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I studied the now hihiirokane-comprised straight sword together.</p>
<p id="line_523">In the end, we discovered that this sword would only respond to my mana.</p>
<p id="line_524">Even if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> infused his mana with it, the blade would remain jet black, and the metallic reaction at that point was still magisteel. However, it had indeed transformed into authentic hihiirokane.</p>
<p id="line_525">This hihiirokane seemed capable of resisting the wavelengths of every single physical property. Normally, it wouldn’t even reflect light because it simply cancelled out the wavelengths within the visible light spectrum, which probably explained why the blade was pitch black. It could mask its unique properties from others as well—even from my ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ How impressive.</p>
<p id="line_526">Only when I imbued it with my mana and entered a state of combat would this sword begin to give off a rainbow-colored shine.</p>
<p id="line_527">Even though it might be too eye-catching to unsheathe in a public area, as long as I didn’t infuse it with my mana, it should masquerade as an innocuous sword well enough. Moreover, it was also far sturdier than most average weapons, or should I say, its immutable properties meant that “It could not be destroyed.” Even when it was damaged, it could be repaired by saturating it with mana.</p>
<p id="line_528">I was curious about what would happen if two hihiirokane weapons clashed with one another, but I suppose it was no use thinking about something impossible like that.</p>
<p id="line_529">There was only one thing I could say for certain right now: this straight sword was worthy of being my weapon, and that it had evolved to outshine the sturdiness of any other sword in the world. With this sword complementing my ‘Absolute Defense,’ I could afford to be a bit reckless at times.</p>
<p id="line_530">In addition—</p>
<p id="line_531">This sword was not complete just yet.</p>
<p id="line_532">In order to engrave it with a magic marble—magic crystals of different spirit properties—I planned on drilling a hole at the base of the blade so that said marble could be inserted.</p>
<p id="line_533">I was looking forward to the day that this sword could be finally considered complete. It was already quite impressive, but I couldn’t help but feel excited at the thought of its great potential.</p>
<p id="line_534">“This sword is really something else. Despite the fact that I was the one who made it, the state it is in now is something I could have never imagined…”</p>
<p id="line_535">“No no no, that’s not true at all. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is super amazing!”</p>
<p id="line_536">“Thanks for the compliment. I am truly happy to hear <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s praise like that!”</p>
<p id="line_537">The special properties of this sword were only possible because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, while undeniably modest, was the one that made it. That much was certain.</p>
<p id="line_538">“Even so, I believe that this sword can triumph <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s saber.”</p>
<p id="line_539">My sword was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s greatest masterpiece, so wouldn’t it be at least the equivalent of a legendary-grade?</p>
<p id="line_540">I had spoken based on this thought.</p>
<p id="line_541"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s answer to my comment was quite unexpected. “Are you referring to the legendary-grade Moonlight Saber? Hmm… Actually, this should be stronger. Perhaps this sword could possibly be a lead-in to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> weapon witnessed by Veldora-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_542"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—that was a phrase synonymous with the word “ultimate” and “supreme.” There was no such equipment for sale on the market. There was no such record of it in legends and folktales. However, something like that definitely existed.</p>
<p id="line_543">For instance, Milim’s magic sword, Tenma, was certainly one of them. She had shown it to me before. At the time, even ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ failed to yield any results. According to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, the quality of Tenma was above that of the Moonlight Saber. This sword had become a precious item like Tenma—I couldn’t help but imagine that it had also reached the ultimate realm of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_544">According to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it appeared that my sword, at its present state, was at the level equal to higher-end legendary-grade weapons. In a way, there was a lot to look forward to as it had the potential of reaching <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> quality one day.</p>
<p id="line_545">We were both mesmerized by the sword for some time.</p>
<p id="line_546">“Ah ah, it’s such a cool sword—”</p>
<p id="line_547">“Indeed. Such beautiful blade patterns are truly a rare sight.”</p>
<p id="line_548">The immutable hihiirokane gleamed brightly, adding a beautiful color to the Hamon—demonstrating the very essence of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s skilled techniques.</p>
<p id="line_549">We both couldn’t contain our excitement while observing the almost art-like patterns of the blade. Its beauty was irresistible; it was the best sword I had ever laid eyes on. And it would also continue to evolve. It wasn’t that far of an exaggeration to say that I had already acquired a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> weapon.</p>
<p id="line_550">This unexpected discovery made me very happy.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_551">I heard a flurry of panicked footsteps coming my way.</p>
<p id="line_552">The person heading for the front of my office had no intention of stopping and immediately burst through the door without so much as a polite knock.</p>
<p id="line_553">I could tell that it was Milim.</p>
<p id="line_554">Had anyone else been so rude, they would have met Rigurd’s iron fists. If it were Veldora or Ramiris, they would have been punished by having their desserts confiscated. But Milim was a special case, so let’s not pursue the matter with her.</p>
<p id="line_555">After all—</p>
<p id="line_556">“R-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! It’s hatching, it’s gonna hatch!”</p>
<p id="line_557">—It was because Milim had been holding onto an egg this whole time.</p>
<p id="line_558">She had refused to go back to her home country, insisting on staying in our nation. She was worried that something might happen to the egg and felt that it would be safer keeping it near me.</p>
<p id="line_559">Milim looked panicked.</p>
<p id="line_560">Judging by her demeanor, I assumed that the egg was probably hatching soon. Milim’s old friend, Gaia, lived in the egg—the ‘Avatar Core’ was flickering on and off.</p>
<p id="line_561">It was only a matter of time.</p>
<p id="line_562">Gaia, a new <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, was about to be born.</p>
<p id="line_563">“Gyuuiii!”</p>
<p id="line_564">A tiny chibi dragon broke from its shell.</p>
<p id="line_565">Its length was around fifty centimeters. It was hard to believe, given its tiny size, that this used to be the Chaos Dragon.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/{: this.app.otherConfigs.coloredIllustrations ? 'colored_illustrations/image1.png' : 'illustrations/image1.jpeg' :}|{otherConfigs.coloredIllustrations}|"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_566"></p>
<p id="line_567">“—Are you Gaia?”</p>
<p id="line_568">“Gyuu, Gyuu!”</p>
<p id="line_569">The young girl and the tiny dragon hugged each other tightly.</p>
<p id="line_570">It was very moving seeing the two reunited.</p>
<p id="line_571">Gaia managed to hatch not long after Milim barged in. With the safety of her friend assured, Milim was now at ease. Yet, when I thought that this meant she was returning home, it turned out not to be the case.</p>
<p id="line_572">“Come on, let’s take Gaia out on an adventure!” Milim proposed excitedly.</p>
<p id="line_573">—No, I expected her to say something like this.</p>
<p id="line_574">Naturally, my answer was—</p>
<p id="line_575">“I mean, Frey-san must be quite worried about you, right?”</p>
<p id="line_576">Frey-san had become Milim’s guardian. If I played with Milim without giving her prior notice, she would undoubtedly get angry. It would be a different story had Gaia not been born, but seeing how energetic and healthy it was, Milim now had to go back and take care of the work she had been putting off.</p>
<p id="line_577">“WAHAHAHA, there’s nothing to worry about!”</p>
<p id="line_578"><em>Nothing to worry about?</em></p>
<p id="line_579"><em><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> did give Milim some of his wise advice.</em></p>
<p id="line_580"><em>Yet his advice has been completely ignored!</em></p>
<p id="line_581"><em>Just kidding.</em></p>
<p id="line_582"><em>I mean, since Milim suggested it, I guess I don’t object.</em></p>
<p id="line_583">I had been busy dealing with the aftermath of the whole incident with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and I’ve only recently started to take a break. It wasn’t a bad idea to have some fun with my friends after working all this time.</p>
<p id="line_584">“Besides, it’s actually a necessity! Dragons are apex predators and will only eat what they hunt. Even babies are the same, so we need to teach Gaia how to hunt,” Milim smugly added.</p>
<p id="line_585">I heard that dragons don’t go hungry very easily, and how they could survive on water and magicules alone. The downside was that they wouldn’t grow. If we wanted it to grow bigger and stronger, appropriate workout and hunting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as meals were absolutely essential.</p>
<p id="line_586">That was why Milim sought to adventure with Gaia. My initial impression was that she just wanted to run away from Frey’s clutches, but it turns out that she had actually thought things through a lot.</p>
<p id="line_587">“Right, then I know the perfect place for that.”</p>
<p id="line_588">“Uh! Is it the labyrinth?”</p>
<p id="line_589">“Umm, that’s right!”</p>
<p id="line_590">And so, we initiated our plan to nurture Gaia.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_591">Now that the issue was settled, let’s gather everyone here as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="line_592">I called Veldora and Ramiris, telling them that we were challenging the labyrinth once more. This time around, we would bring Gaia along and form a party of five. Even a newborn like Gaia was safe inside the labyrinth. Compared to bringing him on an adventure in the outside world, full of unknown variables, the labyrinth was unquestionably less risky.</p>
<p id="line_593">“GAHAHAHA! We are actually quite busy right now, but because it’s you guys asking for the favor, we will have to give you our full assistance!”</p>
<p id="line_594">“Umm umm, you guys can rest assured now that we are here. Have faith that Gaia will grow just fine under our care.”</p>
<p id="line_595">I suddenly felt uneasy.</p>
<p id="line_596"><em>—No, it’s all right. I gotta have faith in them.</em></p>
<p id="line_597">Veldora and Ramiris had been maturing, so they should be able to read the atmosphere and act accordingly. Even Milim knew that this was not playtime but educating Gaia. Surely, they wouldn’t be selfish and do whatever they wanted.</p>
<p id="line_598">“Well then, let’s go!”</p>
<p id="line_599">At my command, everyone possessed their <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> avatar.</p>
<p id="line_600">Our adventure had begun.</p>
<p id="line_601">We went to power level Gaia.</p>
<p id="line_602">Me, Veldora, Ramiris and Milim.</p>
<p id="line_603">Besides the four of us, there was Gaia, who was capable of flying, following me. Gaia was a dragon. It was originally the Chaos Dragon that possessed the power to destroy the world.</p>
<p id="line_604">It shouldn’t be weak at all.</p>
<p id="line_605">And just as I suspected, it was indeed a dignified and very strong creature. It only took a few fights for Gaia to calibrate and get the hang of fighting. Furthermore, it had a wide-ranging dragon breath attack that could take out a whole group of enemies.</p>
<p id="line_606">‘Chaotic Breath’—a highly concentrated miasma with a curse that corroded any substance it touched. Its effect was similar to the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Corrosion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ of my ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gluttonous King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Beelzebuth" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ and its power was so strong that most <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> couldn’t defend against it. In addition, Gaia possessed the ‘Earth’ spirit, a power carved in its ‘Soul’ since birth, which enabled it to control gravity.</p>
<p id="line_607">Had the unsealed and freed Chaos Dragon retained intelligence—the mere thought of that possibility terrified me. With abilities like ‘Curse Breath’ and super-gravitational waves being thrown around, the number of casualties would have definitely been much greater.</p>
<p id="line_608">But that was all in the past now.</p>
<p id="line_609">Nowadays, Gaia was Milim’s cute pet and our reliable companion.</p>
<p id="line_610">We shouldn’t be wary of it.</p>
<p id="line_611">It was then that a Blood boar appeared.</p>
<p id="line_612">Blood boars resided in the area near the thirtieth floor and were a rank B <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with strong legs. Its head and shoulders were protected by thick bones and muscles, while its skin was harder than steel. With a total body length over two meters, it would charge into its enemies with a speed of around fifty kilometers per hour. No one would be able to withstand that type of attack.</p>
<p id="line_613">If you encounter it in a narrow passage, the blood boar was an unavoidable dangerous enemy. Yet, even a dangerous <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> like that was no match for our team.</p>
<p id="line_614">Gaia’s ability to control gravity meant that the blood boar’s charge was unexpectedly dulled. Seizing this opportunity, Milim landed a fatal strike and ended the blood boar’s life.</p>
<p id="line_615">The blood boar, feared for its ability to end up drenched with the blood of its enemies, had become a staple in Gaia’s diet. With the outcome of today’s hunt, I looked forward to Gaia’s growth in the future.</p>
<p id="line_616">As you can see, our team cooperated very well with each other.</p>
<p id="line_617">Gaia also had a skill called ‘Gravity Barrier,’ which was expected to reduce the effects of a physical attack. This, combined with my magic barrier, gave us additional protection against enemies’ magical attacks as well.</p>
<p id="line_618">We learned all sorts of coordinated team attacks in the following days, and Gaia quickly became an integral member of our party. After that, we continued gaining actual fighting experience while at the same time, securing food for Gaia. Eventually, we made our way down to the forty-ninth floor.</p>
<p id="line_619">Thus, the level boss of the fiftieth floor, who was quite the challenge for us last time, was defeated.</p>
<p id="line_620">“GA-HAHAHA! <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> can no longer stand against us!”</p>
<p id="line_621">“That’s right, that’s right! <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is not that strong after all!”</p>
<p id="line_622">“WAHAHAHA! That felt great!”</p>
<p id="line_623">“Gyuu!”</p>
<p id="line_624">These guys sure were excited.</p>
<p id="line_625"><em>Eh? What do you mean we’re having too much fun?</em></p>
<p id="line_626"><em>Nonsense, all this hard work is for Gaia’s sake.</em></p>
<p id="line_627"><em>I mean, maybe a little.</em></p>
<p id="line_628">We were more or less enjoying ourselves during the process, but it was for Gaia’s benefit as well.</p>
<p id="line_629">With this elegant-sounding reason, we returned to town from the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_630">“Looks like you all had a lot of fun.”</p>
<p id="line_631">A smiling Frey-san was waiting for us, with veins visibly popping across her forehead and a spine-chilling atmosphere surrounding her.</p>
<p id="line_632">“Eh, EHHH! F-Frey! I-It’s not like that. There’s a very important reason behind this—!”</p>
<p id="line_633">I felt a sudden sense of déjà vu.</p>
<p id="line_634">Why?</p>
<p id="line_635">What happened next was predictable too, as if I had somehow seen it before.</p>
<p id="line_636">“Didn’t you promise me that you’d return once Gaia hatched?”</p>
<p id="line_637">“I-It’s not like that. Gaia needed me!”</p>
<p id="line_638">“Yes, that’s right, but was that enough to break our promise?”</p>
<p id="line_639">“B-but it needed education…”</p>
<p id="line_640">“Just like how Gaia requires education, I think you could use some education too.”</p>
<p id="line_641">“…?!”</p>
<p id="line_642">This battle was settled.</p>
<p id="line_643">Milim couldn’t seem to persuade Frey. Regardless of how desperately Milim tried to deny it, Frey was unmoved.</p>
<p id="line_644">I, of course, didn’t want to step on the tiger’s tail. And to be fair, Frey was being reasonable anyway. In the end, Milim tried to resist like a spoiled child, crying and causing a scene. However, she stood no chance against Frey’s unfazed smile, and thus Milim was taken away, defeated.</p>
<p id="line_645">All right then.</p>
<p id="line_646">It was Milim’s fault to begin with, so it couldn’t be helped. If she had at least contacted Frey first, then she wouldn’t have been so angry, but it was too late now.</p>
<p id="line_647">“I’LL BE BACK!”</p>
<p id="line_648">Milim left after saying this, though I didn’t think there’d be a third time…</p>
<p id="line_649">Even though she hadn’t been given a curfew yet, and I was sure she’d be able to get permission to come visit me regularly, I believed that kind of privilege was in jeopardy at this point. Frey knew that it’d be dangerous if she didn’t at least give Milim some time off, and that was why she had been generous with her. However, I didn’t know what would happen if Milim kept running away from her responsibilities.</p>
<p id="line_650">But that was someone else’s business, which I preferred to stay away from and rather observe. Although it would probably still be best if she could teach Milim about ReCoCo (report, communicate, and consult).</p>
<p id="line_651">While thinking so, I saw Milim off.</p>
<p id="line_652">I was keeping Gaia by my side for the time being. There was an unlimited number of Resurrection Bracelets in the labyrinth for it to use, as well as plenty of food to eat. In addition, we even switched our avatars to automatic mode and let them explore with Gaia together. It was a fantastic way of allowing Gaia to keep on training.</p>
<p id="line_653">It was still too early for Milim to directly coach it. I anticipated that we’d let him grow its strength to a certain extent before handing it to Milim.</p>
<p id="line_654">And so, we had a new companion in the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_655">—On a side note:</p>
<p id="line_656">Eventually, five unique <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> found roaming the labyrinth were deemed as special level bosses, and struck fear into people’s hearts. There were rumors among the challengers—these bosses appeared to have two levels of strength. While they were already terrifying in their normal state, they became extraordinarily powerful in their second state. To put it simply, we were puppeteering what were viewed as uncontrollable, nightmarish fiends.</p>
<p id="line_657">But we only learned that later on.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_658">I was afraid of what would happen to me if we secretly played while Milim was absent.</p>
<p id="line_659">That was because once the automatic mode of our avatars were deactivated, their growth would sell us out to Milim. And even if there wasn’t much growth, Milim’s keen instincts would probably expose us regardless. Therefore, it was best that we avoid such a dangerous act.</p>
<p id="line_660">So, I would like to introduce you to my serious work.</p>
<p id="line_661">Since we would be dealing with the Western Nations, we had to outline laws as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="line_662">As the ruling <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of the Jura-Tempest Federation, I held the final say on all matters. While most of my work could be handled by people like Rigurd to some extent, the important decisions had to be reviewed by me personally.</p>
<p id="line_663">I had a great deal of authority.</p>
<p id="line_664">To put it bluntly, I could manipulate the judicial, legislative, and executive powers at will. This was because I held the absolute right to control these three powers—and so, I held absolute power over the nation.</p>
<p id="line_665">I was even overseeing military command, which could be considered the cornerstone of this nation. I could march our army with a single order. The appointment of any officers had to be approved by me as well.</p>
<p id="line_666">The word “Federation” was purely superficial; in truth, this was no different than a dictatorship run by me.</p>
<p id="line_667">But in reality, I just tossed all my work to other people.</p>
<p id="line_668">Administrative matters were handled entirely by Rigurd, while in terms of the military, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was acting on my behalf and held full control over it.</p>
<p id="line_669">We were currently recruiting talents to serve as their aides.</p>
<p id="line_670">Rigurd was learning about the separation of powers, whereas the former goblins chiefs, Rugurd, Regurd and Rogurd were acting as the head of the Judicial, Legislative and Executive branches, respectively. Nevertheless, there was a slight problem here—separation of powers could not be maintained without some kind of oversight.</p>
<p id="line_671">Similar to Japan’s parliamentary cabinet system, the boundary between the legislative and executive was blurred. It was difficult foreseeing what correct measures I had to take in order to improve this problem.</p>
<p id="line_672">Anyway, we began setting up the Legislative branch.</p>
<p id="line_673">Regarding that, our nation settled on creating a Senate and a House of Representatives. Senators from the Senate would be appointed by me while the representatives from the House of Representatives would be elected through public elections.</p>
<p id="line_674">The senators would not change. They would be allowed to continue serving forever unless they fell from grace by getting in any kind of trouble.</p>
<p id="line_675">On the other hand, the representatives from the House of Representatives would be elected by the public. Holding an election wouldn’t be easy. It was going to require a lot of trial and error.</p>
<p id="line_676">The Legislative branch would only be in charge of drafting laws.</p>
<p id="line_677">Then, the Executive branch would be in charge of carrying out the charted laws and see to it that the nation operated accordingly. I wanted to have someone talented in order to solidify our Executive branch.</p>
<p id="line_678">Using the Japanese bureaucracy as an example, even with the prime ministers constantly changing over and over, the nation still functioned very solidly.</p>
<p id="line_679">Although there have been more and more problems in recent years…</p>
<p id="line_680">Anyhow, we must be practical and push forward our policies gradually. We needed someone who possessed tenacity and diligence so that they wouldn’t give up so easily during the execution of our laws. However, long-term plans tended to waste unnecessary resources, and perhaps officials might be bribed to do bad things, so I wanted to prevent this kind of thing from happening by closely monitoring them.</p>
<p id="line_681">As for the first wave of officials to take office in the Executive branch, I intended to select them from the pool of goblin tribe chiefs in Tempest. The elders, on the other hand, were to be elected by proxy.</p>
<p id="line_682">In this regard, I believed it would eventually turn into a meritocracy. We were still in the process of reconciling the stakes and rivalries of each tribe, but I hoped that in the future, we would be able to unite together as one. Although it would also take time for us to do so, I wanted our nation to pursue a policy of peaceful reconciliation.</p>
<p id="line_683">Leaving that aside, there was a problem here.</p>
<p id="line_684">Those who were good at governmental duties tended to be mostly weaker races, whereas those who were at the top of the militant races were not good with the paperwork.</p>
<p id="line_685">This was a troubling issue.</p>
<p id="line_686">Should we focus on the strength within the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> world, or focus on the coexistence with humanity, knowledge, and coordination? It was quite the conundrum.</p>
<p id="line_687">No matter how strong some people were, I wasn’t going to tolerate criminals; this was already well known to us. In addition, the military honestly had bragging rights to the sheer power they possessed. However, that didn’t mean they could interfere with the country’s operating policy. Depending on the future policies, I was afraid that it might cause discontentment.</p>
<p id="line_688">Legislation, at its core, was gathering the opinions of the people, drafting them into law, and having it approved by the Executive.</p>
<p id="line_689">However, at the Executive level, even the weak could control power by using their wits, and the strong could be deprived of their rights.</p>
<p id="line_690">Wouldn’t some people have a problem with that? This was to be expected at this stage.</p>
<p id="line_691">After all, the Executive played an important role.</p>
<p id="line_692">The Executive branch had the responsibility of managing the national budget, and the vast amount of wealth amassed in Tempest would be put to use by public officials. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was our top financial functionary, but he alone could not uncover every single case of corruption and fraud.</p>
<p id="line_693">Moreover, the division of territories also fell under Executive control. I expected that appointments would be made to develop regions at the appropriate time, but that plan might also become a point of contention. To prevent this from happening, all decrees would be issued in my name.</p>
<p id="line_694">Finally, there was the Judicial Branch.</p>
<p id="line_695">The most important work of the Judicial Branch was to try people who had been arrested and charged with a crime.</p>
<p id="line_696">Police power was vested in the Executive Branch; yet, the power of arrest was not limited to only the Executive, but also to the Legislative and Judicial Branches. The purpose was, of course, mutual oversight.</p>
<p id="line_697">The judiciary was responsible for sanctioning persons that were under arrest.</p>
<p id="line_698">It was the Judicial Branch that required the highest regard for impartiality, and to protect the order of law without being swayed by the opinions of the people. Relying on the law to punish without mercy—that was surprisingly difficult.</p>
<p id="line_699">I was also troubled by the question of how to guarantee a fair and just trial.</p>
<p id="line_700">In any case, in order to implement the separation of powers once and for all, I was learning alongside Rigurd. The people’s voices must be heard, and legislation must be discussed and enacted together. It was essential to establish a transparent political system.</p>
<p id="line_701">In terms of administration, Rigurd and other talented people were currently being selected as officials and were training to become bureaucrats. In order to strengthen the authority of the central government, it was necessary to create a law enforcement agency as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="line_702">The military, under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s direct control, and the intelligence agency “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dark Shadow" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>” led by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, would answer only to my commands. In order to prevent chaos in the chain of command, it was decided that they would not listen to any orders from the Executive Branch. Therefore, I was planning to appoint someone quite powerful as the head of the Public Prosecutor’s Office.</p>
<p id="line_703">There was another thing.</p>
<p id="line_704">The judiciary also had problems.</p>
<p id="line_705">Conducting trials could easily stoke violence and resentment on all sides. This demanded not only smarts, but a certain amount of adroitness to get the job done.</p>
<p id="line_706">Of course, judges needed protection, but that thought alone was disturbing.</p>
<p id="line_707">Purposefully attacking a judge for the sake of revenge was absolutely intolerable, and was grounds for an immediate death sentence. However, we couldn’t rule out the possibility of someone being aware of the consequences and still committing a crime like that.</p>
<p id="line_708">Unlike humans, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were tough. No matter how discrete the security was, officials were susceptible to ambushes. That was why we wanted our judge to have some personal physical strength.</p>
<p id="line_709">“Uh—in that case, relying on Rugurd alone is rather concerning,” I admitted.</p>
<p id="line_710">Rigurd agreed with my view. “Right. Even though he is my close lieutenant, he’s not as strong as a centurion. If we switched to Rogurd however, he wouldn’t lose to any average youngsters…”</p>
<p id="line_711">Rugurd had a deep and ruthless side, but could deliver an honest verdict. Good for a judge, but not powerful enough to protect himself when things went wrong.</p>
<p id="line_712">Rogurd was a strong man, and can take on a thousand captains one-on-one. However, he was spearheading all the ministries and departments in the Executive Branch in place of Rigurd, and therefore it would be difficult for him to transfer over to the Judicial Branch.</p>
<p id="line_713">I pondered for a bit. “I would like to set up a prosecutor’s office within the Executive Branch. If it’s a domestic crime, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the security force will be able to stop it, but when it comes to cracking down on executives and lawmakers, it’s too much of a burden for those guys, isn’t it?”</p>
<p id="line_714">“Indeed, you’re right. All sorts of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, even named <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, may come to our nation. In addition, people confident of their own strength from various countries will also gather here due to the influence of the opening ceremony. It’s not surprising that there’s going to be a lot of commotion.”</p>
<p id="line_715">While most of the effects of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were positive, due to a certain event that occurred, it’s also begun to attract strong characters. In a way, it was what we wanted, but some fools simply couldn’t be satisfied by the labyrinth, they had to go to town and make a mess.</p>
<p id="line_716">With <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s return, the security force had been strengthened significantly. But Rigurd didn’t think that was enough.</p>
<p id="line_717">“There are still A-ranked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, aren’t there?” I asked.</p>
<p id="line_718">“Yes, although the numbers are small. They haven’t shown any outward signs for wanting to rampage, but I thought it would be prudent to stay vigilant.”</p>
<p id="line_719">Just like Rigurd said, preparedness was very important.</p>
<p id="line_720">There was a huge difference in the fighting abilities between each individual, so it was smarter to be proactive rather than reactive when dealing with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s.</p>
<p id="line_721">“Hmm, the Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Judicial Branch. There’s also the matter of sending someone to be our diplomat in the Western Council. At the moment, we all have our own jobs to do, so it doesn’t seem like a good idea to make any personnel changes…”</p>
<p id="line_722">“It would be more confusing.”</p>
<p id="line_723">Hmm…that was going to be a headache.</p>
<p id="line_724">The system was being established, the laws were beginning to be enacted, but the necessary resources for actually executing them was still in its infancy. There were many vacant positions that needed to be filled.</p>
<p id="line_725">That was the downside of rapid growth, and it was something we could not avoid. I could only sigh at our lack of manpower…</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_726">It was no use ruminating over not having enough personnel.</p>
<p id="line_727">I decided to lighten my mood by inspecting the construction sites.</p>
<p id="line_728"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was building a new capital on the ruins of Beast Kingdom <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Eurazania" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_729">The construction was going smoothly and the foundation work had been laid out. We laid the foundation all the way down to bedrock, and magical high-strength concrete foundations connected by steel and rebar proved to be an excellent base. By using stones with mana as the building material, not only were they sturdy, they would give off an unique magic wavelength that repelled low level spells.</p>
<p id="line_730">The downside was that we could not use magic to reduce its weight during transportation, but the positives outshined that, so I suppose it was good enough. By the time this giant castle was completed, not only would it be capable of defending against an outside attack, it would also block magic being used inside as well.</p>
<p id="line_731">We were even able to create magic rocks that were several hundred times harder than concrete. After polishing it, a towering pillar rose from the center, supported by the foundation, and seemed to almost reach the sky. Using the pillar as support, the outer walls were being erected next.</p>
<p id="line_732">I should mention that the scale of this project was simply enormous. The pillar alone was a spectacle. Below, people were bustling around like busy ants. It was certainly a strange sight to behold, but it was also evidence of just how massive the building was.</p>
<p id="line_733">“Ah, it’s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama.

<p id="line_734">Not wanting to bother everyone working, I came here using ‘Teleport’ from my ‘Spatial Domination.’ But it appeared that I was discovered by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the end.</p>

<p id="line_738">He wouldn’t be reacting this way had the operation not gone smoothly.</p>
<p id="line_739">The cheerful atmosphere at the site was what made the work enjoyable.</p>
<p id="line_740">“No no no, I really mean it. You guys seem to be doing a lot better than I anticipated. Will you guys be finishing soon?”</p>
<p id="line_741">“Indeed. It is thanks to everyone getting along so well.”</p>
<p id="line_742">According to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he thought a lot by himself after his talk with me.

If it was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they probably would’ve lost their nerve and killed the misspoken <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Once again, I was reminded of how kind-hearted <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> truly was.</p>
<p id="line_749">And just like that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> managed to unravel the minds of the captives.</p>
<p id="line_750">He would also invite them out for drinks every week and treat them to delicious meals. Nowadays, they had been completely won over by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s masculinity and were willingly assisting us.</p>
<p id="line_751">More importantly—they felt that they could be of help to other people; having their efforts recognized must have filled them with pride. Not only were they laboring hard to be freed of their captive status, they were also experiencing the fun of working. This was far more efficient than forcing them to work. In some sense, our effective approach was to be expected. And so, these higher <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s’ support became a great help to us.</p>
<p id="line_752">We resolved the lack of manpower issue while at the same time, work became more efficient. Naturally, with this improved efficiency, construction was progressing far better than I hoped.</p>
<p id="line_753">In fact, in contrast to the progress of construction sites in my previous world, it was quite shockingly fast. Honestly, the two could not even be compared in the first place. And keep in mind that construction was proceeding entirely by hand, since heavy machinery didn’t exist.</p>
<p id="line_754">People might be dubious at this comparison, but when they see the construction in person, surely these doubts would be blown away.</p>
<p id="line_755">After all, these <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s could not be seen as natural or human.</p>
<p id="line_756">Some were able to lift up several tons worth of material by themselves.</p>
<p id="line_757">Some could obliterate junk and rocks in the way with their bare hands.</p>
<p id="line_758">Of course, some of them could fly, so their safety standard for working several stories in the air was different than humans.</p>
<p id="line_759"><em>No wonder they’re so fast</em>—I nodded with a serious look on my face.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_760">There were construction projects at several other locations as well.</p>
<p id="line_761">If this was war time, it was a bad idea fighting on several battlefields at the same time, but with construction, it was a different story. Construction could be carried out with different phases of planning to maximize efficiency. Furthermore, this was a fantastic training opportunity for our field engineers, which was why we arranged field officers to lead each team and let them give orders at their discretion.</p>
<p id="line_762">To be more specific, there were four locations with construction occurring—the outskirts of Dwargon, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Eurazania" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_763">The one near Dwargon had already been connected with a highway, with inns lining it. The goal of the current project was to widen the road and lay down tracks, specifically for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. We also hired adventurers as paid labor. Because of the job offer, it had quite the surge of popularity. The site was full of energy.</p>
<p id="line_764">On the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> side, it was just like Dwargon’s route. The difference was that the one in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was already broad enough, so we could start laying down rails directly. It wouldn’t take too long before it was finished.</p>
<p id="line_765">The one leading to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Eurazania" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was next. For now, we had everyone working on jobs such as widening the road while preserving the natural environment. The wood cut down from the process would be transported to the new but still under construction capital. That was why we had been making arrangements so that the supplies could be shipped out at a faster pace.</p>
<p id="line_766">The road leading to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, on the other hand, was not progressing so smoothly. We initially began with cutting down forests, but it was taking more time than expected. The main workforce there consisted of high orcs. They could use ‘Stomach’ to transport material. As they were the most skillful of workers, the task of widening the road should have posed no problems.</p>
<p id="line_767">However, they were also required to transport the wood they had cut down. This type of work required more manpower, which would only be sufficient by the time the operation in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Eurazania" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was complete and the two construction crews rendezvoused.</p>
<p id="line_768">First, our workers needed to be able to traverse the forest. After which, we planned to gradually build and then pave the road. We would only start drilling the tunnels and laying down tracks after everything was complete.</p>
<p id="line_769">This was the current situation on our four main fronts.</p>
<p id="line_770">Some people were against the idea of running the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to the Armed Nation of Dwargon. They claimed that predicting the movements of the Eastern Empire was impossible, and that there was a possibility of information leakage.</p>
<p id="line_771">Furthermore, they were afraid that the Eastern Empire would steal the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and repurpose it for military invasion. In that way, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> tracks we went through all the trouble of laying down could turn out to be a double-edged sword.</p>
<p id="line_772">Others were also worried that the route was going to be sabotaged.</p>
<p id="line_773">Some even suggested that “We should build a fortress to face the Empire.”</p>
<p id="line_774">The inn town near Ameld river had a large residential area. They were arguing to settle at the location and turn the town to a strategic fortress city. I had considered the proposal, but ultimately decided against it. I thought it was meaningless.</p>
<p id="line_775">Right now, we still had no idea what the Eastern Empire would do. The thought of adding more to our growing pile of work definitely put me off. Even though we had more manpower these days, there were still a ton of things that needed to be done.</p>
<p id="line_776">However, this did not mean that we were being careless.</p>
<p id="line_777">It wasn’t that we were sitting idly by with the assumption that the Eastern Empire wouldn’t launch a preemptive strike, but rather that if the other side did seriously attack us, then we would simply do our best to crush our enemies. I did not want to continue dealing with them with a facade, and it was incredibly foolish maintaining a high level of vigilance all the time.</p>
<p id="line_778">It depended on how the Empire came at us, but we intended to meet their challenge with full strength and force a short yet decisive victory. Among our ranks, some of our lieutenants also agreed to this more direct approach.</p>
<p id="line_779">By the time the war began, the train tracks, among other things, that we spent so much time putting down would likely be destroyed. However, even if that turned out to be the case, we could always construct them again. We should not delay the progress of our development just because we were afraid of something that might happen in the future.</p>
<p id="line_780">The same goes for the angels’ invasion.</p>
<p id="line_781">No matter who our opponent was, we would not back down.</p>
<p id="line_782">We will roll with the punches when the time comes.</p>
<p id="line_783">We would simply have to rebuild what was ruined.</p>
<p id="line_784">While it was crucial to think about how to protect these things, people were more important, not objects. As long as we protected the craftsman, then everything would turn out fine.</p>
<p id="line_785">With this resolve in mind, the construction and development of the projects were carried out at an incredible pace, thanks to sheer determination and planning.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_786">The last location I visited was the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmenas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_787">Following our agreement, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> found some workers to handle the preparation duties tied to the opening of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. We received reports that they had completed both selecting an initial route for laying track and the subsequent site surveys.</p>
<p id="line_788">This was progressing faster than I had anticipated too.</p>
<p id="line_789">I thought they would only handle the matter after the farming season, yet <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—or rather, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myuran" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—seemed to prioritize the train tracks.</p>
<p id="line_790">“It’s only rational. If the agricultural products of our nation can be exported to other nations, then that means the foreign currencies earned will enrich our nation. I’m well aware of this. In addition, it’ll make it easier for ration support to arrive should there ever be a famine. When this wonderful <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is complete, I will not allow our nation to be ill-prepared and lack the necessary infrastructure,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myuran" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> declared with a smile, clearly more concerned than I was.</p>
<p id="line_791">Despite the fact that she was now the queen of the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmenas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, she still very much cared about the nation’s policies.</p>
<p id="line_792">“Hahaha, I am honestly useless these days. Rommel was good at these things, so I sent him to supervise the field operation.”</p>
<p id="line_793">With a wry smile, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> introduced me to a man named Rommel.</p>
<p id="line_794">I recalled seeing him before in the past. He was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s mage companion during his time as an adventurer.</p>
<p id="line_795">Rommel nervously reported the current situation to me.</p>
<p id="line_796">Scrolling on a precision map that was the equivalent of national secret, he pointed out specific locations to pass the road and rails through. The map also clearly indicated the results of each detailed survey, just as I had instructed.</p>
<p id="line_797">We all agreed that I would finalize the measurement in the end, which was why I headed immediately to the construction site.</p>
<p id="line_798">I then used the rest of the day to double check all the information.</p>
<p id="line_799">“While there is still room for improvement, everything seems to be in order. Did you assign someone to keep records of each region?”</p>
<p id="line_800">“Yes, everything has been completed according to your arrangement.”</p>
<p id="line_801">“Then, please inform the person in charge that they need to resurvey this section here, here and here again.”</p>
<p id="line_802">It looked like they were doing a good job nurturing new talents. The accuracy of the schematic that had been drafted was within the margin of error I had permitted. While some teams seemed to have exceeded this margin, it showed that they had been undoubtedly studying very carefully. Although I asked them to reevaluate their surveys, they should be able to find the mistakes themselves. While it might be harsh, we couldn’t let this go that quickly.</p>
<p id="line_803">It would be meaningless if I were the one finishing all the work since I had incredible precision. I hoped to encourage the new talents by having them finish all the procedures by their own hand. Considering their present skill level, this minor investigation shouldn’t take long.</p>
<p id="line_804">We might even begin the construction early, so I’d have to inform Kaijin and the others to prepare the automatic, barrier-producing magic generators beforehand. They had a proven track record. Thanks to the magic generators, the roads connecting our nation and the Kingdom of Blumund were safe and sound. The stone tablet would also glow after reacting with magicules, meaning they could be used as landmarks in the dark. Both travelers visiting Tempest and the patrolling soldiers gave high praises to the invention. Here in the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmenas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the magicule concentration was lower than that of the Great Jura Forest, but I still planned to deploy some generators here.</p>
<p id="line_805">That day, I received a grand welcoming ceremony by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others.</p>
<p id="line_806">“To be honest, I never expected you to come here by yourself. Young Master is just as easy-going as usual.

<p id="line_807">But he was mistaken.</p>
<p id="line_808">I was not by myself; I brought Ranga with me.</p>
<p id="line_809">“Ranga is here too.”</p>
<p id="line_810">“Do you require my service? Master!”</p>
<p id="line_811">Responding to my words, Ranga extended his head from my shadow.</p>
<p id="line_812">“WOAH! So you were there, gave me a good scare…”</p>
<p id="line_813">“Of course. Even though there shouldn’t be anyone bold enough to challenge a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, protecting my master is my duty as a subordinate. Please have this understanding when you act as the ruler of a nation.”</p>
<p id="line_814">“I’ll pass. When Edgar can stand by himself, I’m getting rid of this boring king role.”</p>
<p id="line_815">Edgar was the son of the former king <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Edmalis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He seemed to be a pretty clever lad and his royal bloodline was irrefutable. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought his usurping the crown did not have a justified enough cause and wanted to have a proper member of the royal family act as the heir to the throne.</p>
<p id="line_816">However, Edgar, the person in question—</p>
<p id="line_817">“Your Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, please don’t speak of nonsense like that!

My dream is to serve that person in the future, so please don’t say something that could be taken for unnecessary dispute!”</p>
<p id="line_818">He didn’t seem to want to be king as he rejected <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words.</p>
<p id="line_819">As opposed to that—</p>

<p id="line_832">“By the way, regarding <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grucius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he seems to have been hit rather hard by this news. He hasn’t been himself ever since…” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> mentioned sadly.</p>
<p id="line_833">No wonder.</p>
<p id="line_834">I had been planning to ask why I hadn’t seen <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grucius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> since my arrival.</p>
<p id="line_835"><em>It’s all right, I’m sure he’ll find his other half.</em></p>
<p id="line_836">But that was not something I would know.</p>
<p id="line_837">I couldn’t get a girlfriend for the longest time myself, so this was a problem <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grucius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had to solve himself.</p>
<p id="line_838">“I’m sorry to hear that. With <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grucius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in that state, are you sure the knight order is fine?” I questioned.</p>
<p id="line_839">Likely due to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s interfering, the thriving insurgency had been pacified, so I figured there shouldn’t be anything to worry about. However, it was still concerning to have the commander of the knight order acting like this, which was why I was afraid there might be problems.</p>
<p id="line_840">“It’s all right, my companions were within the order too. More importantly, Uncle Razen is amazing. Just like what a living legend is supposed to be, he’s something else.”</p>
<p id="line_841"><em>Oh yeah.</em></p>
<p id="line_842">This nation still had Razen.</p>
<p id="line_843">I heard that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> took him as his servant. He seemed to be working pretty hard for the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmenas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I mean, after all, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> made a pact with him using the Unique Skill ‘Tempter,’ so we shouldn’t have to worry about him betraying us.</p>
<p id="line_844">“Speaking of this Razen-sama, he’s been energetically overseeing the domestic situation. He would regularly contact us with magic and even assisted us in eliminating dangerous elements across the kingdom!” Edgar revealed with shimmering eyes that only a young boy could have. Apparently, Razen was very popular in this nation.</p>
<p id="line_845">I had received all sorts of reports about him and thought that this Razen was only involved with immoral and dirty business, but perhaps from the perspective of someone trying to protect his nation, he probably was a very outstanding person.</p>
<p id="line_846">I didn’t intend to pick a problem with him and instead listened very carefully to what Edgar had to say. With a change of perspective, how you viewed certain things began to change as well.</p>
<p id="line_847">As the saying goes, history is written by the victors, and the losers lose everything.</p>
<p id="line_848">In the eyes of this nation’s citizens, King <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Edmalis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Razen were the righteous ones. Had we been defeated during our war with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> army, we would likely have been known in history as an evil and vicious band of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_849">I didn’t intend to belittle my opponents with illegitimate means like that, but that was merely because there was no need to do so.</p>
<p id="line_850">With that in mind, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s rejuvenation of this nation was a huge success. He managed to retain the exceptional individuals from the old systems among his rank and as a result, kept the public outcry to a minimum and continued to rule the nation. In addition, they also managed to manipulate information such that harmful comments against our nation were kept from spreading, and instead, we were now considered a friendly country.</p>
<p id="line_851">At this rate, human prejudice towards <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would likely soon fade away. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sure was impressive. He was able to understand human nature well enough to bring me the outcome I wished. Everything was proceeding according to plan.</p>
<p id="line_852">Feeling satisfied, I chatted with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others for the rest of the day.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_853">During my absence, Ramiris and Veldora seemed to be hard at work too.</p>
<p id="line_854">After having inspected all the major construction sites and returning home, the two came out to welcome me.</p>
<p id="line_855"><em>Is there a problem? Or do they have something to show off?</em></p>
<p id="line_856">It was the latter.</p>
<p id="line_857">“Great news, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! The prototype is finally finished. If the test run is successful, we begin producing actual models en mass!”</p>
<p id="line_858">“Umm umm, I’m very confident this time, come check it out!”</p>
<p id="line_859">Urged by the two, I followed them as they hurried along.</p>
<p id="line_860">Right now there were several research facilities within Tempest. The one open to the general public was the smithing workshop used by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and his disciples.</p>
<p id="line_861">The technology there couldn’t be pirated or immediately learned.</p>
<p id="line_862">While the special weapons I asked them to craft were mainly kept secret, other armaments and gear were displayed to the public for advertisement purposes. And by using methods such as displaying newly crafted items, we hoped to build brands around <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Garm, respectively.</p>
<p id="line_863">However, what came next was the real deal.</p>
<p id="line_864">These research facilities had their location kept strictly confidential from the public. We wanted to construct these institutions in locations that were difficult for any average person to enter, but at the same time, could defend easily. Based on these criteria, we ultimately decided to build them inside the underground labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_865">At one hundredth floor stood the research facility for me, Veldora and Ramiris’s personal usage. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was appointed as the director of our nation’s official research institute. In addition, a forest was already growing on the ninety-fifth floor, and so a large research facility was established there as well. Since all of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> refugees had already left for their home country, it was an empty, spacious area that we promptly utilized.</p>
<p id="line_866">Alchemists from Dwargon, magic researchers from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Vampiric researchers from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who allegedly had been bored out of their minds, all gathered here in our country, and thus required a large-scale research facility. The researchers sent by these nations were experts in all kinds of different fields.</p>
<p id="line_867">The alchemists from the Armed Nation of Dwargon were experts in spirit engineering. The ‘Magic Armored Soldier’ scheme that Kaijin and Vesta were once involved in was essentially an inquiry into that type of research.</p>
<p id="line_868">In this world, people believed that natural phenomena were directly related to the power of spirits. There was a total of five traditional spirits: earth, water, fire, wind, and space. Furthermore, there were also the three greater spirits of light, dark and time. The science that utilizes phenomena caused by these spirits, and the subsequent technology related to them, was known as spirit engineering.</p>
<p id="line_869">It was one of the most well-known fields of research in this world.</p>
<p id="line_870">The magic researchers from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, on the other hand, studied the more secretive field of ‘Magic Science.’ It was a realm that only those who had mastered magic could reach. It was said that the basic theories were first proposed by a genius elven researcher, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Emperor Elmesia’s mother. There seemed to be fewer and fewer people who were able to inherit the knowledge contained within this field.</p>
<p id="line_871">To what extent could the world be changed by manipulating the laws of magic?</p>
<p id="line_872">I heard that even philosophy was considered to be a part of this field’s study.</p>
<p id="line_873">I felt that it was something <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would love to look into.</p>
<p id="line_874">The fundamental theory of ‘Magic Science’ seemed to infer that by forcefully altering phenomena, spirit engineering can be developed. The difficult part was that the theories could only be understood by mages that have mastered elemental magic. However, the practicality of this unique theory was also obvious. It was no wonder why Sorcerer’s Dynasty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> declared it to be a national secret and forbade anyone from leaking it to other nations.</p>
<p id="line_875">The last batch of researchers were vampiric. I took them in as a result of my agreement with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. They were called ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Surmounter" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s,’ a group of strong people, each equivalent to a Calamity-class threat. The problem was they were all oddballs, but luckily there weren’t a lot of them. At first, I thought they’d be a headache for me if they were to start causing trouble, but I quickly realized that I was worrying too much.</p>
<p id="line_876">“Yo—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama! Moi is most interested in fun stuff!”</p>
<p id="line_877">The leader of the group was a very bright and easygoing guy that quickly broke the ice. They were simply people that wanted to explore and learn new things. They didn’t mind if their colleagues were humans, elves, or dwarves. Their priority was to sate their curiosity.</p>
<p id="line_878">Although, there were indeed some arrogant individuals.</p>
<p id="line_879">However—</p>
<p id="line_880">Veldora and Ramiris were the ones supervising things. Even though Ramiris herself was not that menacing, her assistant Beretta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san would not sit still to any rudeness directed at their master.</p>
<p id="line_881">The arrogant ones’ demise was truly tragic.</p>
<p id="line_882">“Oi, where’s my tea?” a certain annoying dragon demanded.</p>
<p id="line_883">“Yes—right away…!”</p>
<p id="line_884">“Ahh, what a rough day. My shoulders are so stiff,” a certain annoying fairy sighed.</p>
<p id="line_885">“Please allow me to give you a massage…!”</p>
<p id="line_886"><em>What are these ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Surmounter" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s’ even…</em></p>
<p id="line_887">“Oh, these stupid idiots, you’re useless!” the leader of the vampires lamented, but at least he didn’t complain about this to Veldora or Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_888">And so, they had a surprisingly smooth time integrating with everyone.</p>
<p id="line_889">What they were researching was even more interesting. The vampires’ research was the polar opposite of ‘Magic Science.’ <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> labeled their research as “useless,” but I disagreed.</p>
<p id="line_890">The research the vampires were undertaking was exactly the same as ‘Engineering Physics’ back on Earth. It was devoid of any magical components and instead tried to discover the laws of the natural world. By jotting down detailed records of natural phenomena, they would then turn them into physical laws. This was the essence of their study.</p>
<p id="line_891">They always wound up obtaining the same outcome, regardless of who the researcher was at the time.</p>
<p id="line_892">In some sense, it was to be expected, but there were also many variants due to the many magical phenomena in this world. In a way, this field of study could be considered unorthodox.</p>
<p id="line_893"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t seem to like it, but I believed it was quite interesting.</p>
<p id="line_894">To be honest, the recording of data was a means to kill time to the vampires, but this huge collection of data was significant. If we were to use this data as a foundation, we could investigate the influence of magic on the world much more easily.</p>
<p id="line_895">A breakthrough in science often came from the accumulation of small, minor discoveries over time. Therefore, what they were researching should not be underestimated.</p>
<p id="line_896">And so, we managed to bring scholars of varying fields to our nation.</p>
<p id="line_897">The knowledge they carried over was immeasurable, and the research findings as a result of this academic exchange would prove to be invaluable. We needed to ensure the personal safety of every researcher, in addition to keeping the outcome of their research confidential. That was the duty our nation had to uphold.</p>
<p id="line_898">The researchers working here were wearing specially-designed bracelets. It was a fine gadget that Ramiris made, which removed the numerical limit on the traditional Resurrection Bracelet. It also included functions such as communication and teleportation within the labyrinth, though the preset teleportation destinations were only the surface and the research facility.</p>
<p id="line_899">Since the researchers had to keep all sorts of secrets, we had to inconvenience them on some matters. Based on these considerations, we gave away these items for free.</p>
<p id="line_900">They could only access the predesignated locations and couldn’t move between floors or teleport to other areas. Moreover, once they teleported, relevant data about the user would be recorded to prevent any information leak.</p>
<p id="line_901">Although, they still had other means to move around; for instance, asking the dryads to help teleport them. In that regard, they needed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s direct approval. All in all, there shouldn’t be any way to conduct espionage activities within the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_902">Technically speaking, however, the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Surmounter" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s’ might have other methods of breaking these restrictions, but doing so could be dangerous for them. Even I had no idea the exact types of traps that were set in the labyrinth, so it wouldn’t be easy for these vampires to try and break through them.</p>
<p id="line_903">Furthermore, all of their activities were being monitored, so if they were up to some dishonest activities, we could immediately pursue them. And if they got stuck in parts of the labyrinth, we could easily apprehend them.</p>
<p id="line_904">There were reasons for such strict regulations.</p>
<p id="line_905">I had been informed that highly developed civilizations tend to attract attacks from the angels—and that was the main reason why we had prepared so thoroughly.</p>
<p id="line_906">In that regard alone, there was no safer place than Ramiris’s labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_907">Inside there—specifically, the ninety-fifth floor of the labyrinth—it should be possible to stop even the angels’ invasion. Ramiris bragged that if anything were to happen, she could switch the floors instantly, exchanging floor ninety-five for floor ninety-nine.</p>
<p id="line_908">This deep city within the labyrinth was likely the safest place in all of Tempest.</p>
<p id="line_909">In order to prevent secrets from leaking, this place was completely isolated. On top of that, the labyrinth also provided the perfect environment for the welfare of the staff, including health care, so the labyrinth was a great living environment too.</p>
<p id="line_910">The ninety-fifth floor had some of the most luxurious service facilities in our nation, so I figured that would be enough to satisfy the researchers.</p>
<p id="line_911">By the way—</p>
<p id="line_912">While the sealed cave was considered as a major research site in the past, it had been shut down. The prolonged planting of hipokute herbs caused the concentration of magicules to drop drastically within the cave. Therefore, even though the concentration was still relatively high, the product yield would naturally not be as ideal. That was why we decided to move the hipokute plantation to a different location.</p>
<p id="line_913">With that being said, we had already planned to transform the flower field on floor ninety-three to a special zone for growing hipokute herbs. We would merely increase the magicule concentration on the floor in order to mutate the weeds.</p>
<p id="line_914"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others’ research facility was moved underground to the hundredth floor too, since one of the reasons why the plantation moved was for conveniences’ sake.</p>
<p id="line_915">The sealed cave was excavated all the way to the back of the mountain and became a residence for the wyverns. Since that was considered a military secret, we had completely shut down the location, preventing any ordinary citizens from entering. All vital research would be conducted within the labyrinth in the future.</p>
<p id="line_916">As I suspected, the two were bringing me to the ninety-fifth floor’s research facility.</p>
<p id="line_917">The fact that we weren’t heading to their private chambers appeared to suggest we were reviewing the results from our joint research agreement. They did mention a prototype, so it seemed that the research was going smoothly.</p>
<p id="line_918">It looked like our key item would be ready just in time for the railroad tracks to open.</p>
<p id="line_919">The ninety-fifth floor, which I hadn’t visited in a while, had gradually become a forest-type city before I knew it.</p>
<p id="line_920">In this beautifully maintained park, the cityscape seemed to mesh perfectly with the surrounding trees.</p>
<p id="line_921">I always wondered how they managed to erect such a large city, but considering some of the elves had once lived in the forest, this was probably the manifestation of their wisdom.</p>
<p id="line_922">The treants seemed to have also helped build this wonderful place.</p>
<p id="line_923">Naturally, the challengers who only briefly visited the labyrinth were barred from entering this hidden town. Only those who had challenged the labyrinth under official rules earned the right to enter the city.</p>
<p id="line_924">I stopped by the elven cabaret quite often myself, but I seldom visited them in the morning. That’s why I didn’t expect this place to change so much.</p>
<p id="line_925">I had been leaving everything in Veldora and Ramiris’s hands, and this result was very interesting. The other floors seemed to have undergone drastic changes too. I couldn’t help but anticipate a more casual trip to the labyrinth in the future.</p>
<p id="line_926">With that in mind, I continued to follow the two.</p>
<p id="line_927">Soon, I laid eyes on the research facility in the center of the park. The building was constructed from reinforced concrete, so it was rather jarring. There were also many large buildings adjacent to the main facility. We also had a dormitory for the foreign researchers to sleep in. For some reason, these supposedly brand-new buildings built under my supervision looked a bit ancient. However, it did give off a rather unique air, so I guess that was okay.</p>
<p id="line_928">“It’s so quaint with all these trees nearby,” Ramiris gushed.</p>
<p id="line_929">“Right? A research facility obviously needs an aura of mystery!” Veldora declared proudly.</p>
<p id="line_930"><em>What ‘aura of mystery’ are you talking about? They’re like a bunch of kids joyfully building their secret base. Where did you learn all this bizarre stuff?</em></p>
<p id="line_931">“Everyone’s getting along well, we were even thinking about forming a secret society!”</p>
<p id="line_932"><em>Secret society?</em></p>
<p id="line_933"><em>What the hell have you guys been doing here?!</em></p>
<p id="line_934">“Hehehe, wasn’t <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> the first one to reveal everyone’s research results? Some people originally wanted to steal other nations’ technology, but because of what you did, they were finally able to turn back on the right path.”</p>
<p id="line_935">I never expected this.</p>
<p id="line_936">There were huge barriers between nations, and researchers from different countries were no different, since they all had contrasting opinions. Each had their home nations’ best interests in mind, and some planned to absorb the technology of others while keeping their own hidden.</p>
<p id="line_937">I figured this joint research wasn’t going to work if that happened, and so I decided to expose everyone’s technology in one go.</p>
<p id="line_938">In the eyes of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei, there was no such thing as “secret technology.” I summarized everything so that it was easy to understand, like some kind of official manual, and handed everyone a copy. I had generously used up all the expensive paper that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> helped prepare for me. Although it was a little wasteful, I deemed it a necessary loss.</p>
<p id="line_939">As opposed to parchment, I wanted to record information on paper that was made from plant fibers. The paper given to me by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> appeared to be manufactured by the Empire, though its quality was almost the same as paper produced on Earth. I was sure everyone saw my seriousness after using all this valuable paper. After the incident, the researchers became very open with one another. Everyone was cooperating out of pure desire to fulfill their intellectual curiosity.</p>
<p id="line_940">“Ohh, you compiled confidential information from every nation involved and made it into a data book so everyone could read it, didn’t you? Even though people were very vocal about it at the time, I thought it would lead to new technologies being developed.”</p>
<p id="line_941">“Umm umm, we share just this thought with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! We later held a recognition-of-service party and everyone found a kindred spirit in each other,” added Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_942">Consequently, researchers gave up on trying to hide their technological secrets and began cooperating with each other; strangely enough, an unusual sense of solidarity quickly developed within the research facility. It seemed that everyone was no longer just thinking about their home nation. Even the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Surmounter" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ vampires had become companions that considered themselves to be our equal.</p>
<p id="line_943">Things were getting interesting.</p>
<p id="line_944">This was good.</p>
<p id="line_945">Yet despite this fantastic outcome, there was a problem.</p>
<p id="line_946">The researchers gradually formed the structure of a community, which was led by Veldora and Ramiris. That might be the reason why an independent organization was formed.</p>
<p id="line_947">That’s right.</p>
<p id="line_948">It was like some sort of evil secret society, where everyone could enjoy researching the things they truly liked. It was quite the mysterious environment. Ramiris was especially interested in the various fields of research. She eventually became the group’s mascot and idol. Veldora, on the other hand, became the evil ringleader.</p>
<p id="line_949"><em>These guys seriously did this while I was gone…</em> With that being said, I figured if I were here, they would probably do something <em>even more</em> outrageous.</p>
<p id="line_950"><em>—No, that can’t be true.</em></p>
<p id="line_951">With that thought in mind, I continued my conversation with them.</p>
<p id="line_952">“So that’s why the place now looks like this.”</p>
<p id="line_953">“How about it? Isn’t it cool, having an evil secret base?”</p>
<p id="line_954"><em>Ah, just as I suspected. It really is a secret base.</em></p>
<p id="line_955">Veldora’s source of information was mainly reproduced from my memories. That explained why the research facility looked the way it did, straight from manga and other sources. As a result, my intuition regarding the reasons behind his actions was often the right answer.</p>
<p id="line_956">“Tsk, you guys sure were having fun by yourselves.”</p>
<p id="line_957">“GAHAHAHA! It’s nothing really. What comes next is the important part. We will need your wisdom in the future.”</p>
<p id="line_958">“That’s right, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! You always give us a scare. Now it’s our turn to surprise you. Take a look at our research first before you share your opinion.”</p>
<p id="line_959">Hearing the accidental slip of my genuine thoughts, Veldora laughed out loud while Ramiris tried to comfort me.</p>
<p id="line_960">I shouldn’t sulk after what she said.</p>
<p id="line_961">I regained my composure and followed the two into the facility.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_962">A group of men clad in white coats were working tirelessly.</p>
<p id="line_963">And in front of me was a moving miniature train.</p>
<p id="line_964">This was what you called a “model train,” though it was still large enough for an adult to ride on it.</p>
<p id="line_965">“Yo, Young Master! Did that surprise you?”</p>
<p id="line_966">It was none other than Kaijin. He was acting chief director, and he had on a rather unfitting white lab coat.</p>
<p id="line_967">The hall was roughly the same size as a university auditorium, and the ground was marked with railways, making it impossible for people to stand around.</p>
<p id="line_968"><em>There’s models of mountains, valleys, and tunnels here were…made for aerodynamic analysis?</em></p>
<p id="line_969">“Indeed. As expected from Young Master to have seen through their purposes right away. Honestly, the impressive thing here is all of the talented researchers that have gathered in our nation. They managed to build such an amazing facility with ease.”</p>
<p id="line_970">Indeed, Kaijin had a point.</p>
<p id="line_971">It was thanks to the engineers’ collaboration that this groundbreaking facility had been created.</p>
<p id="line_972">This three-dimensional model was created using magic. Kaijin made the masterpiece of a prototype train, currently running along on the track, and it was one of his best works yet.</p>
<p id="line_973">“What’s powering this train?”</p>
<p id="line_974">I could have deciphered it using <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei’s ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ but I asked about it on purpose.</p>
<p id="line_975">“Steam,” Kaijin replied with a grin.</p>
<p id="line_976">I nodded in response. It was just as I thought.</p>
<p id="line_977">Right now, horses provided the physical power for trains operating within our nation. These horses would pull the carriages as they slid along the track. Naturally, the total load capacity was about the same as horse-drawn carriages. Although it improved stability and helped reduce traffic, overall efficiency hadn’t improved a significant amount.</p>
<p id="line_978">There had been proposals for either golems or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to drag trains around, but these proposals ultimately could not solve the root of the problem.</p>
<p id="line_979">The key was to develop a locomotive.</p>
<p id="line_980">And its primary source of power was the steam engine.</p>
<p id="line_981">Of course, it wouldn’t use old world technology like burning coal. Rather, we tried to create an engine that utilized both the strengths of magic and science.</p>
<p id="line_982">This was why we named it the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_983">The concept behind the magic engine was using magic to convert magicules into an energy source, which then provided the combustion energy that gave rise to steam—this was the basic magical mechanism. Perhaps this prototype could be called the ‘Spirit Magic Core.’ Even though it was a simple design, it still required sophisticated magical technology.</p>
<p id="line_984">The laws that magic obeyed were drastically different than those that governed the natural world. It was difficult trying to observe any patterns from the former, due to its ability to grant effects purely by imagination.</p>
<p id="line_985">For instance, let’s say there was a lit candle inside a transparent glass container. The enclosed space would quickly consume oxygen and produce a high concentration of carbon dioxide. However, if the fire were made by magic, it would continue to burn regardless. As long as the mage’s mana and the necessary magicules were still there, the magical fire wouldn’t disappear. Naturally, the mage’s mana had a finite limit, so the fire couldn’t burn forever.</p>
<p id="line_986">Through this experiment, we could see that magical flame was governed by laws different from that of the chemical reaction behind combustion. Therefore, even if you tried to apply the same phenomenon for another purpose, the reality was that it wouldn’t work. Consequently, hardly anyone correlated magic to the laws of physics in this world.</p>
<p id="line_987">With that being said, the magic here purely referred to elemental magic.</p>
<p id="line_988">Spirit magic, which could be cast by borrowing the power of spirits, would not be manipulated by a mage’s imagination. In other words, it was a magic that delivered the power of a spirit—a being whose existence was based on natural phenomena—in its original, purest form.</p>
<p id="line_989">This meant that the fire caused by spirit magic would consume oxygen and generate carbon dioxide.</p>
<p id="line_990">By the way, during my battle with Ifrit in the past, ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Great Sage" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ had warned me about causing a steam explosion. The reason why it could have potentially worked was because Ifrit’s flames obeyed the same properties as fire in the natural world. Had it been elemental magic, which alters the laws of physics using magicules, my strategy undoubtedly wouldn’t have worked.</p>
<p id="line_991">This was the same reason why I could use spirit magic while inside the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Purification Barrier" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’</p>
<p id="line_992">There was one more thing.</p>
<p id="line_993">In order to illuminate the cave inside, I once used ‘Engraving Magic’ to heat up metal, yet the light generated proved insufficient. Thus, I had Dold work on it and he changed it to another spell. Apparently, he devised a method of directly converting magicules into light by applying elemental magic.</p>
<p id="line_994">Thanks to magic, there were some processes that could be completely bypassed for results. Yet, the downside was that there wasn’t much interest behind analyzing the natural phenomenon in this world.</p>
<p id="line_995">In order to recreate the technology of physical phenomenon, it would be better to utilize spirit magic, which also relied on the same type of physical phenomenon. And that was how I came up with the idea of incorporating spirits as the power source for the magic engine.</p>
<p id="line_996">Kaijin was very impressed. “Sometimes, we would boil water with the excess heat from the fire at the smithery, but we never knew we could use steam this way.”</p>
<p id="line_997">I was more shocked at their technological capabilities as they were able to recreate steam engines solely from my explanations.</p>
<p id="line_998">“All in all, there are a lot of methods to power it. For instance, using pistons, turbines, and steam—basically, it’s using thermal energy to do either mechanical work or converting it into electricity. That will be our field of research in the future. It appears that the research in the piston mechanism is going rather smoothly,” I commented.</p>
<p id="line_999">“Ah, you’re right, Young Master. If we can figure out how to work with electricity, then we can produce a great deal of power,” agreed Kaijin, turning to the small train.</p>
<p id="line_1000">I have had discussions regarding electricity with Kaijin and the others before. They seemed to have done plenty of research since then, and now possessed some level of understanding.</p>
<p id="line_1001">I was starting to think that they knew more about it than I did.</p>
<p id="line_1002">Kaijin was gazing at the locomotive that had six trains attached to it. Each one was carrying some iron ingots. If this was the real deal, then it was capable of transporting a huge amount of weight efficiently.</p>
<p id="line_1003">“In this lab, we can recreate all sorts of different environments. We are currently in the tropical rainforest, but the room next door is the desert region. The room next to that is currently simulating a snowy region. We collect data individually from each room so that we can design trains for each environment,” Ramiris, who at some point had flown onto <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s shoulders, described with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_1004">Even one of the vampires, with his shiny fangs, nodded vigorously after hearing this. “It’s truly wonderful that moi and the others are of some help. Moi loves these types of experiments.”</p>
<p id="line_1005">This happy go lucky guy was a bit of a weirdo. Rather than saying he enjoyed experimenting, he was more like a mad scientist who had no interest in anything else. But they genuinely had been of great help.</p>
<p id="line_1006">He handed over his very neatly written notes. It was full of detailed remarks that filled up every single page.</p>
<p id="line_1007">By the way, the paper was made of plant fibers.</p>
<p id="line_1008">We could get more supplies if we started trading with the Eastern Empire, but right now, we did not have any trade interaction. Under these circumstances, I had asked them to start by researching paper.</p>
<p id="line_1009"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s subordinates were very good at monotonous work like that. And so, I assigned it to them, and they immediately developed a low-quality paper prototype made out of wood fibers. After that, they were on their own, but through a lot of trial and error, the paper quality quickly reached a good standard. Even though they did have physical samples, as well the necessary information about the steps to produce paper, this was still very impressive work.</p>
<p id="line_1010">I immediately praised them afterward.</p>
<p id="line_1011">Back to the topic of the important notes I was given.</p>
<p id="line_1012">There were a lot of questions, proposed solutions, experiments, and their subsequent outcomes. It was all very intriguing.</p>
<p id="line_1013">There were passages regarding motive power, and the required amount of magicules for generating it; a record of how long the engine managed to run and the accompanying deterioration; the estimated load capacity and the load conditions on the cargo bed. This allowed us to calculate the stability of the interior train, and even the extent of the train’s acceleration.</p>
<p id="line_1014">All of this data could be used as reference when we eventually built a full-scale locomotive. I hurriedly sped through everything, and it seemed that all the relevant theories had been completed.</p>
<p id="line_1015">Given the aforementioned information, we could actually start crafting a prototype—eh, could it be?!</p>
<p id="line_1016">“Oi, Veldora, when you mentioned ‘prototype,’ could it be that you weren’t referring to the model train, but something else?”</p>
<p id="line_1017">“Kukuku, how impressive. You really know your stuff to have noticed that,” Veldora laughed happily.</p>
<p id="line_1018">Ramiris, now sitting on <em>his</em> shoulder, had a smug look as well.</p>
<p id="line_1019">I glanced around the room and realized that all the researchers, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san and Beretta all had the same expressions.</p>
<p id="line_1020">Before I knew it, they had gathered and lined up next to a certain door.</p>
<p id="line_1021">In that case…</p>
<p id="line_1022">Kaijin began to explain as he slowly walked towards that door. “We went through a lot of trouble making it. Turns out summoning a fire spirit in the engine alone was not enough. We needed to control the power output and had to have actual workers stationed nearby. Therefore, each locomotive would need to be staffed with a qualified mage. We could start to train mages based on the number of trains planned for manufacture, but it would take too much time. That’s why we decided to build and install magic circuits in the train to automatically regulate it. The fire spirit, which is the engine’s ‘Core,’ and the control panel engraved with ‘Engraving Magic’ that controls it; everything came together to give you the finished product.”</p>
<p id="line_1023">He offhandedly mentioned about summoning spirits, but the process proved to be a major hindrance. Because lower spirits lacked enough power, mid-tier spirits, such as fire salamanders, had to be summoned at the very least.</p>
<p id="line_1024">A salamander’s power could reach up to rank B-plus, which was impossible for any average person to summon.</p>
<p id="line_1025"><em>Is it because Ramiris is here after all?</em></p>
<p id="line_1026">It likely had to do with the fact that she used to be the Queen of Spirits. It seemed that anything spirit-related was a piece of cake for her.</p>
<p id="line_1027">As I was left shocked, Kaijin put his hand on the door handle.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1028">“Oh oh, this is…”</p>
<p id="line_1029">It was past the door.</p>
<p id="line_1030">It had a black, shiny, and somehow majestic appearance. It was clearly made of magisteel, but at the same time, it looked like a steel <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that gave off a dangerous aura.</p>
<p id="line_1031">While feeling impressed, I heard Vesta’s proud declaration. “This is the culmination of our technologies, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Zero!”</p>
<p id="line_1032">I was under the impression that it was still in the experimental phase, yet there it was, completed. And even if it was just a prototype, this was the train that I dreamt of.</p>
<p id="line_1033">We managed to take one big first step forward.</p>
<p id="line_1034">“We will likely be testing the durability of the train’s body. Not only do we plan to make freight cars, but also passenger cars, resting cars and dining cars.”</p>
<p id="line_1035">“Honestly speaking, even the locomotive itself isn’t finished yet. I’m trying to refine certain details and make it more complete.”</p>
<p id="line_1036">Vesta and Kaijin were both filled with motivation as they spoke.</p>
<p id="line_1037">All the researchers were ardently gazing at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Zero, so I guess there was still room for improvement.</p>
<p id="line_1038">“There’s also the electricity <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> mentioned; that one was a bit difficult. I had a wind spirit summoned to generate electricity, though we weren’t able to use that energy directly…”</p>
<p id="line_1039">That was to be expected.</p>
<p id="line_1040">While electricity was indeed a versatile resource, it was also exceedingly difficult to control.</p>
<p id="line_1041">“First, we will need to develop batteries. Once we succeed, we will be able to utilize the locomotive’s excess thermal energy to generate electricity. If we manage to do that, it will broaden the possibilities to make the train ride more comfortable. It’s definitely worth trying.”</p>
<p id="line_1042">While I barely understood anything on the matter, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei had translated my memories of technological textbooks from Earth into the local language, and then transcribed everything for me. I then handed the consolidated book to Vesta, assured that he was going to put them to good use.</p>
<p id="line_1043">It felt like the secondary use of it through magic, but it was very convenient.</p>
<p id="line_1044">“Indeed, that’s how it is. I wanted to bring this up when you mentioned electricity back there, but in the end, I decided to do it after you saw it for yourself. After all, ‘Seeing is believing.’ Let’s take a look.”</p>
<p id="line_1045"><em>Could it be that they’ve already put electricity to practical use?</em></p>
<p id="line_1046">With this thought in mind, I followed Kaijin.</p>
<p id="line_1047">I climbed in and was immediately met with surprise.</p>
<p id="line_1048">The inside of the locomotive was enveloped in a gentle halo of light.</p>
<p id="line_1049">I turned to Kaijin and conveyed with my eyes, “What’s this about?”</p>
<p id="line_1050">“By the time Young Master handed me the data, I had already made my decision. Didn’t you too, Vesta?”</p>
<p id="line_1051">“Of course. When <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama handed the research regarding the application of electricity to us, Kaijin-dono and I studied the materials in detail. Even though there are still parts that I don’t understand, with all these researchers under one roof, we were able to utilize everyone’s wisdom.”</p>
<p id="line_1052">“Well, that’s right. Everyone helped answer our questions and doubts. And, when I saw the Elemental Colossus of that little girl there—Ramiris-sama—I was truly surprised. A working product of our abandoned ‘Armored Soldier Project,’ right in front of me,” Kaijin recalled.</p>
<p id="line_1053">Indeed, that was the case.</p>
<p id="line_1054">If you had the real thing right in front of you, obviously you would get a better understanding of how it worked.</p>
<p id="line_1055">Right now, another Elemental Colossus was being built and was supposed to become a subject of research.</p>
<p id="line_1056">“Exactly. As I read that book and heeded varying opinions, I realized that we had a serious misinterpretation. Back then, we experimented under the belief that elemental magic and spirit magic were the same kind of magic. That was the source of our mistakes—”</p>
<p id="line_1057">“—So then, we deduced what we were lacking by investigating with the Elemental Colossus in front of us.”</p>
<p id="line_1058">What became clear with those results was that the law of magic completely changed depending on the magic.</p>
<p id="line_1059">As for Ramiris’s Elemental Colossus, instead of spirit magic, the summoned spirit itself was being used. Because Kaijin and the researchers tried to move the ‘Spirit Magic Core’ with elemental magic, they failed to initiate a chain reaction and thus wasn’t operating properly.</p>
<p id="line_1060">“—And yet, I ended up increasing the magic output. The result, the magic heat had nowhere to go, eventually grew out of control, and the experiment ended in a failure.”</p>
<p id="line_1061">I see, it was that kind of thing.</p>
<p id="line_1062">In Ramiris’s case, there was a possibility that she simply couldn’t use elemental magic, and thus her Elemental Colossus reflected that. But, as a result, that became the key to success. The Elemental Colossus’s power reactor was the ‘Spirit Magic Core,’ but as engineers gathered en mass, they seemed to have found a way to fully realize its performance capabilities. And by analyzing my ‘Master Core,’ the original ‘Spirit Magic Core’ was completed.</p>
<p id="line_1063">“I feel both happy and frustrated.”</p>
<p id="line_1064">“Yes, I wholly agree. To think that the theory we once gave up on was only due to a misunderstanding…”</p>
<p id="line_1065">Despite how much research they conducted, they couldn’t even see any signs of success with just the theory, but as soon as they clarified and fixed their mistake, they were able to finish and obtain results right away. It was so ridiculous, Kaijin and his team couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p id="line_1066">“What? If we have the ‘Spirit Magic Core,’ we could convert magicules into energy. Well, there are different types of energy, so it’s kind of hard to explain.”</p>
<p id="line_1067">“This locomotive is converting magicules into heat in order to turn the turbines. Thus, we can also generate the electricity that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama mentioned before, and illuminate each car like this, too.”</p>
<p id="line_1068">I was surprised.</p>
<p id="line_1069">No, I was genuinely surprised.</p>
<p id="line_1070">In other words, this train was powered by a fully completed ‘Spirit Magic Core.’ By giving magicules to spirits of various attributes, they would then convert the magicules into a more easily usable energy. Furthermore, they had the ability to circulate energy as well. They could send electricity made by the turbines to the ‘Spirit Magic Core’ and store it safely. Although the spirits were capable of directly generating electricity, Vesta and the others said that the method would be too difficult to control. Therefore, they decided to use the electricity generated in the steam engine instead.</p>
<p id="line_1071">After all, electricity wasn’t that great if it was high voltage. Not only did we need power plants, but also substations and a battery storage facility to actually hold the charge.</p>
<p id="line_1072">To think all that such a complicated process was handled solely by the ‘Spirit Magic Core’…</p>
<p id="line_1073">Moreover, with magicules already in the atmosphere, fuel wasn’t that big of a concern. If the concentration wasn’t high enough, all you needed to do was prepare magic stones, which were simple enough to carry around.</p>
<p id="line_1074">The continuous operating time was determined by the presence or absence of magicules.</p>
<p id="line_1075">If the locomotive were a place where magicules were always present, and as long as it doesn’t do anything strenuous, it technically could—maintenance definitely required—operate forever.</p>
<p id="line_1076">It was like a dream come true.</p>
<p id="line_1077">“Come on, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, aren’t you surprised?”</p>
<p id="line_1078">“We’re like this when we get serious!”</p>
<p id="line_1079">Although it irritated me seeing Veldora and Ramiris brag like that, what they had achieved was admittedly astonishing. For now, let’s just honestly praise them.</p>
<p id="line_1080">“No, it’s amazing. Keep up the good work!”</p>
<p id="line_1081">“Hmm. Leave it to us!”</p>
<p id="line_1082">“Mhmm mhmm, just relax!”</p>
<p id="line_1083">I could understand Veldora and Ramiris’s feeling of wanting to boast because I, too, felt like boasting to someone.</p>
<p id="line_1084">The day that trains began running through our country was drawing closer, and it wouldn’t be long before the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> spread across the world. I couldn’t help but feel excited.</p>
<p id="line_1085">“So, sir, I have one thing I wanted to discuss with you…”</p>
<p id="line_1086">“Yes, what is it?”</p>
<p id="line_1087">“No, you see, I wish to organize a little get-together to celebrate the completion of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Zero. So, you know…”</p>
<p id="line_1088"><em>I see, it’s a get-together in name, but what you really want is to eat, drink and play to your heart’s content, right?</em></p>
<p id="line_1089">I couldn’t exactly say no, so we wound up at one of my favorite nightclubs.</p>
<p id="line_1090">Well, whatever.</p>
<p id="line_1091">“All right! Let’s drink the night away!”</p>
<p id="line_1092">“Thank you so much! That high-class bar is a place that your honor manages, so I couldn’t just rent it out as I want,” said Kaijin, smiling with anticipation.</p>
<p id="line_1093">That place certainly wasn’t the kind of establishment where we could visit in large groups and make a lot of noise. But even before that, we wouldn’t have been able to fit this many people inside anyway.</p>
<p id="line_1094">For Kaijin, it wasn’t about the money either.</p>
<p id="line_1095">“I’ll have them get you a seat outside the restaurant as well. We’ll turn away the other customers for this evening and hold a recognition-of-service party for the research employees here.”</p>
<p id="line_1096">We had known each other after all this time. There was no such thing as a “get-together.” I had decided to hold a recognition-of-service party, with me paying for everything, as a token of my gratitude to everyone.</p>
<p id="line_1097">Or rather, if I had to be honest, I didn’t care what the name was.</p>
<p id="line_1098">Alcohol was best for celebrations.</p>
<p id="line_1099">Whether it was a get-together or a recognition-of-service party, as long as you had a good time, it was all the same.</p>
<p id="line_1100">Thankfully, this was a city of elves famous for its pleasure gardens.</p>
<p id="line_1101"><em>Let’s all share the joy we feel and nourish our spirits for the future.</em></p>
<p id="line_1102">“KUA-HA HA HA! The conversation is flowing well!”</p>
<p id="line_1103">“ “ “Thank you for the food, Your Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!” ” ”</p>
<p id="line_1104">Going along with Veldora, who was in a good mood, the researchers promptly showed their gratitude with a bow. It was such a unified movement that it made me wonder if they had regularly practiced it. Also, the vampires apparently didn’t need fresh blood, judging by the fact that they were enjoying the alcohol too. They took part in it like it was natural.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1105">And apart from that—</p>
<p id="line_1106">“This is exciting! I, too, get to drink alcohol for free today!”</p>
<p id="line_1107">“Oh my, that’s great. But please be careful not to drink too much—”</p>

That’s why, even if their bodies were to be destroyed, they would self-restore and over time, resurrect once again. Perhaps it was due to knowledge of this facet, that he obliterated his foes without mercy.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1121">After inspecting the construction in person, I was able to understand the current situation. The laying of tracks for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was far from complete. We still had a lot of work left, namely: Laying the track between the Dwarven Kingdom and Tempest, between Tempest and Blumund, constructing a road between Blumund and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmenas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and creating the road that started from the Dwarven Kingdom and went south to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Eurazania" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> via Sisu Lake, which was ruled by the lizardmen…</p>
<p id="line_1122">We still had to finish building the road connecting Blumund to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. We also needed to open a tunnel through the Coscia mountains. Only after these plans were complete could the railways be laid down. We must be mentally prepared for long-term construction efforts.</p>
<p id="line_1123">Furthermore, I really wanted to lead the route to the coastline soon so we could provide sea products at a cheap price. We also planned to establish a main railway line between the kingdom of Blumund and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1124">Now that I was considering all of these new connections, it would take some time before the whole traffic network could be considered fully operational.</p>
<p id="line_1125">We also couldn’t forget about the development of the trains. Since the prototype had been completed, we had jumped across the biggest hurdle. Now, all we had to do was to put the prototype through the wringer. Although we had already established our fantastic motor core, the rest of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> still required further development.</p>
<p id="line_1126">It was important to ensure the trains were comfortable to ride. We also had to tackle the issue of noise that the trains would undoubtedly unleash upon its surroundings. Our train was already substantially quieter than traditional steam locomotives. However, traveling at such high speeds still generated a bothersome racket.</p>
<p id="line_1127">The research team headed by Kaijin was currently working to address such concerns. We were breaking down these troubling problems to smaller, bite-sized pieces to tackle them in finer detail and find theoretical solutions. Meanwhile, I also hoped that they kept a record of the processes they took to resolve these issues. It was my wish that this journal would eventually become useful reference material for future research prospects.</p>
<p id="line_1128">With that being said, since we had managed to develop the most challenging component, the ‘Spirit Magic Core,’ it was fine to hand all train-related matters to Kaijin.</p>
<p id="line_1129">For other recently initiated research projects, we spared no expense in their financing from the national treasury. I had to appeal to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> so he could allocate more funds.</p>
<p id="line_1130">And so, I started to visit the research facility frequently. I even got quite familiar with the researchers and had plenty of opportunities to discuss useful ideas. The knowledge I possessed as an otherworlder was all too intriguing to them. They often stopped to consult my opinions.</p>
<p id="line_1131">Although, when they posed a question that I couldn’t answer, I had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san handle it. By entrusting my problems to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei, whose ability rivaled that of a quantum computer, no matter how difficult the questions were, it could solve them with ease. And I have been putting it to use relentlessly as well.</p>
<p id="line_1132">After finishing the day’s work, it was also important to squeeze in some time for socializing at night. While not all the night shops were luxurious, they were still one of the go-to spots for researchers to take a breather from work. There, they could relax and engage in casual conversation.</p>
<p id="line_1133">I, for one, was no exception. Sadly, I didn’t get paid overtime.</p>
<p id="line_1134">Pretty incredible stuff, not gonna lie.</p>
<p id="line_1135">By the way, even though I mentioned that our budget had increased, we definitely did not spend the money on booze. It was all for the sake of research! Surely you guys understand what I mean.</p>
<p id="line_1136">In addition, among Veldora, Ramiris, and myself, Ramiris was the one getting paid the most. Her salary was still very promising even after deducting the costs of running the labyrinth. She was compensated with twenty percent of the labyrinth revenues. It was no longer just the two gold coins we had estimated at the start. Nowadays, she could earn up to twenty gold coins or more.</p>
<p id="line_1137">Twenty gold coins were about two million Japanese yen per day. However, Ramiris was also responsible for paying the salaries of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san and her sisters, as well as Beretta. That said, she was still projected to profit nearly one hundred gold coins by the end of the month.</p>
<p id="line_1138">My daily allowance was the same as Veldora’s: one gold coin a day from the national treasury.</p>
<p id="line_1139">Veldora was the labyrinth master, so Ramiris also rewarded him with extra pocket money. Since the labyrinth greatly depended on Veldora’s magicules, the treasury granted him special bonuses as well. That’s why he actually got paid more than I did.</p>
<p id="line_1140">In spite of this, I did keep some pocket change around. I had been investing in many varying fields and the profits were incredibly favorable.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1141">Motivated by everyone’s enthusiasm for work, I also decided to work hard. I was diligently trying to craft the bodies I had promised <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> for his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> friends to possess.</p>
<p id="line_1142">The person assisting me was Ramiris. In addition, I also couldn’t forget to prepare bodies for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s sisters. I needed Ramiris’s opinions on that.</p>
<p id="line_1143">Ramiris agreed immediately, though she was also insistent on me providing her with more subordinates.</p>
<p id="line_1144">“We have a lot of work to do and not enough people to do it. With only <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-chan and Beretta, my job would be very challenging…”</p>
<p id="line_1145"><em>Isn’t this gal doing this just so she can brag about her having new servants?</em>—while that was my assumption at the time, my viewpoint changed after witnessing how hard <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san and the others were working in the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_1146">Ramiris wasn’t just my assistant, she also had endeavors of her own—namely, reconstructing the Elemental Colossus that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> disintegrated. The most vital component, its heart core, was already completed. In addition, I had also completed the outline and general sketch of the body. We did have an Elemental Colossus available for reference though. We could always refer to that during research. However, the actual construction would require time.</p>
<p id="line_1147">Moreover, Kaijin was busy with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> while Vesta was focused on developing the ‘Magic Armor Soldier’ by himself. If Vesta were available, he’d come to assist Ramiris. However, it would certainly be awfully tiring for him.</p>
<p id="line_1148">We would be incorporating the completed ‘Spirit Magic Core,’ so I also wanted to collect empirical data, and in order to achieve that, the more help we could get, the better.</p>
<p id="line_1149">“By the way, what has Veldora been up to?”</p>
<p id="line_1150">“Hmm—I don’t know what Mentor has been up to. Every time I asked for his help to do some detailed tasks, he suddenly goes missing…”</p>
<p id="line_1151"><em>I see, so Veldora’s still not that reliable, huh…?</em></p>
<p id="line_1152">Yeah, now that she mentioned it, I felt the same way, too.</p>
<p id="line_1153">Veldora always appeared to be assiduously working, moving back and forth from place to place. I thought he was going to be a nuisance for everyone, but it also turned out not to be the case. Despite his appearances, he was actually quite knowledgeable and had been of some help. He also seemed to enjoy being praised. That’s why instead of letting him labor as Ramiris’s assistant, I might as well cut him some slack and let him do as he pleases.</p>
<p id="line_1154">“I get it. I’ll try to do some recruiting on my own.”</p>
<p id="line_1155">“Umm, sorry for the trouble!”</p>
<p id="line_1156">After making this promise with Ramiris, I began to worry about the potential new candidates, and if they were right for the job.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1157">And so, the days quickly passed by. Our daily routine had been quite peaceful—until one day, ‘That <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ suddenly arrived without warning.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1158">I was inside my office. In front of me were stacks of documents that required my attention. It would have taken an average person an eternity to review them all. But luckily, I had ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ at my aid. I ordered it to precisely scan through the files and prioritize the more urgent cases. Then, I scrutinized each document like lightning, swiftly approving or rejecting them.</p>
<p id="line_1159">In reality, I wasn’t toiling nearly as hard as I had described, but performing such monotonous tasks was still quite the chore. I fantasized over <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> being here and laboring in my stead, as I continued the same repetitive motions with my hands, gradually chipping away at the pile.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1160">Then came post-work break time.</p>
<p id="line_1161">I transformed into my original slime self and relaxed on the sofa. <em>So comfy.</em> My body itself was super soft, and the pillow was quite plushy as well. With the two combined, it felt as if I were swimming in a sea of soft feathers.</p>
<p id="line_1162">Now that I had a knack for sleeping, this was my little secret hobby.</p>
<p id="line_1163">Suddenly, I heard a knock on the door.</p>
<p id="line_1164">Just when I was about to slack off for a bit, it appeared someone was stopping by. <em>It can’t be helped then.</em> I turned back to human form and sat down on my chair.</p>
<p id="line_1165">“Come in,” I responded while posing stylishly.</p>

<p id="line_1173"><em>Nothing to worry about.</em></p>
<p id="line_1174">I recalled during the Walpurgis Banquet that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had commented something along the lines of “I’ll drop by to hang out with you.” Although I didn’t pay much attention to it at the time, it looked like he was serious.</p>
<p id="line_1175">“—Understood. Then, I shall do as you have ordered.”</p>
<p id="line_1176"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded first before leading me to the guest room where <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was waiting.</p>
<p id="line_1177">Having a ton of rooms made it super convenient for differentiating who you were receiving. The merchants and noblemen would be shown the luxurious suite. On the other hand, if our guests were suspicious individuals or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with great power, we would bring them to a plain room built with sturdy walls. The reason for this differentiation was to minimize losses on our side if the guests were to start a fight in the opulent suite. That was why the space we currently had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in was more practical than fancy.</p>

He was sitting casually on the sofa—lying down on it, to be precise. He was quite laid back despite being in someone else’s house. To put it bluntly, he was a thick-skinned, airheaded man.</p>

<p id="line_1180">“Hey, long time no see, what’s popping?” he greeted me, showing no intention of getting up, still comfortably sprawled on the sofa.</p>
<p id="line_1181">His reaction made <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> glare at him with distaste. However, she stayed silent and simply left the room after bowing. She was presumably preparing tea for us.</p>
<p id="line_1182">“Umm, I’ve been good. It’s just that I’ve got a ton of problems to deal with, so I can’t say my life’s been carefree, that’s all,” I answered as I sat down on the chair on the opposite side of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1183">I began to carefully observe him.

No wonder <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> acted so cautiously.</p>
<p id="line_1184">“What do you mean? Are you having difficulties? Sounds like a big hassle.”</p>
<p id="line_1185">“Indeed. Ever since I became a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, nothing’s been easy. By the way, what are you doing here?”</p>
<p id="line_1186">“Eh, me?

<p id="line_1187">However, it sounded as fake as it could get.</p>
<p id="line_1188">Both of us fell silent.</p>
<p id="line_1189">It was then that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> entered the room with a tray of tea and desserts. In this room filled with deafening silence, she soldiered on with her duties as if there was nothing wrong. She expertly served both of our portions and left after giving us a bow. She really was professional.</p>
<p id="line_1190">I first took a sip of tea, then stared at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He appeared to have given up the pretense and began speaking slowly, “—Not really. In reality, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> chased me out.”</p>
<p id="line_1191">“Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_1192">“Ahh, it’s nothing.

<p id="line_1194">He spoke those words without a shred of shame. This guy seemed to be the worst kind of trouble.</p>

<p id="line_1196"><em>I must not show any weakness or compassion.</em></p>
<p id="line_1197">“Nope, nuh-uh,” I rejected <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> immediately.</p>

<p id="line_1199">“’Eh’ what?”</p>

Although, I should be the one surprised by how naive his idea was. Even if you knew me, I had no obligation to take care of a suspicious individual like him. Moreover, I instinctively knew this guy was definitely the type to say: “Also, I don’t want to work at all!”</p>
<p id="line_1202">“H-hold on a second. What is this? Do you want me to starve to death in the street?”</p>
<p id="line_1203">“No, but you can get a job.”</p>
<p id="line_1204">“Please don’t be so difficult! My philosophy is to never work. I’ve never made a single coin with my own hands for hundreds of years, nor have I spent a single coin earned by myself, either.”</p>
<p id="line_1205">No wonder. If you don’t work, you obviously would be broke. And consequently, how could you feed yourself with your nonexistent funds?</p>
<p id="line_1206">“Wow, how impressive! Please leave after you finish eating that.”</p>
<p id="line_1207">You have to chase this type of person out as soon as possible.</p>

His expression changed the moment he took a bite.</p>
<p id="line_1211">“Right, I am going to be this nation’s citizen, so let me work for you.”</p>
<p id="line_1212">He suddenly started spewing out some nonsensical crap.</p>

<p id="line_1214">“No, I am serious.

<p id="line_1247">She would undoubtedly get all smug if she heard me praise her like this. That was the reason why I would never bring this up in front of her. However, these were my genuine thoughts.</p>
<p id="line_1248"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was baffled for a bit before asking me timidly, “T-then, when you said job… What exactly am I supposed to do?”</p>
<p id="line_1249">Looks like he really hated being productive. I was struggling to come up with an explanation on the spot when I realized that may not have been the best approach. I should bring him to the actual research site. We could educate him once he was introduced to the people in charge.</p>
<p id="line_1250">“Don’t assume it is anything too difficult yet. Accomplish what you can to the best of your ability. First, let me show you where you will be working.”</p>
<p id="line_1251">“Uh, umm, right. Just don’t expect much from me!”</p>
<p id="line_1252">“Hmm? Ahh, don’t say something like that before you even try. I don’t think there will be any problems. Just follow Ramiris’s instructions.”</p>
<p id="line_1253">With a sense of uneasiness in heart, I decided to bring <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to the private research facility located on the one-hundredth floor.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1254">We teleported directly to the one-hundredth floor, crossing the room that Veldora was guarding. It was a large chamber whose purpose was to receive the arriving labyrinth challengers, while Veldora’s private quarters were situated beside it. There were two rooms in total. There was also no sign of Veldora in either of them.</p>
<p id="line_1255"><em>Where did Veldora go? He’s probably off horsing around somewhere.</em></p>
<p id="line_1256">“Oi oi oi, how come the magicule concentration here is so dense?”</p>
<p id="line_1257">“Oh, because that’s Veldora’s room over there. Don’t go inside, the guy is really selfish. You’ll piss him off if you touch anything.”</p>
<p id="line_1258">“Ah, so this is where Veldora lives. I was wondering what your relationship was with him back during Walpurgis.”</p>
<p id="line_1259">“We are…friends. Good friends.”</p>
<p id="line_1260">“I half guessed that you guys were not just acquaintances, but friends… Well, let’s talk about it later.”</p>
<p id="line_1261">My answer surprised him so much so that even his sleepy eyes suddenly widened a bit.</p>
<p id="line_1262">“I see. That explains why Veldora hasn’t been easy to detect lately; it’s because he’s been hiding inside Ramiris’s labyrinth this whole time…”</p>
<p id="line_1263">“Oh, that’s not it really. His presence disappeared because he learned how to conceal his magicules. That guy used to let his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> go wild, so his magicule leakage was all over the place too. Wouldn’t it be dangerous if I wanted to attract more people to our nation? That’s why I have been telling him to practice and get his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> under better control.”</p>
<p id="line_1264">“Whaaat? Are you saying you’re demanding that egocentric troublemaker, the former guardian of the Great Jura Forest, to listen to you? Moreover, you’re commanding him to regulate his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> so well, that even I couldn’t sense it? <em>That</em> Veldora?”</p>
<p id="line_1265"><em>Can you not make it sound so easy</em>—this was what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> implied as he feverishly questioned me. Even if what he said were true, it still wouldn’t change anything. And that was a fact.</p>
<p id="line_1266">“Umm, yeah. In fact, he agreed immediately. Otherwise, half of the residents in this town would be dead by now.”</p>
<p id="line_1267">“No, even if you put it that way… Isn’t this <em>the</em> Veldora with an insane pool of magicules that we’re talking about here? Isn’t he the flying catastrophe, the tyrant that everyone fears, the one unleashing his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> all the time before the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sealed him up?”</p>
<p id="line_1268">People’s opinions of him seemed rather negative, but they were probably justified. After all, we had an actual example of a victim: <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. From what I had been able to gather, this guy truly had committed all sorts of horrible misdeeds in the past.</p>
<p id="line_1269">“In any case, that guy’s changed a little. Nowadays, if I want to ask him to do something, he’ll listen to some degree. He’s not <em>that</em> selfish.”</p>
<p id="line_1270">“Weren’t you the one who was just complaining about how selfish he was?!”</p>
<p id="line_1271"><em>Eh, did I say that?</em></p>
<p id="line_1272">«Answer. Yes, you did.»</p>
<p id="line_1273"><em>I-I see</em>.</p>
<p id="line_1274">“Selfish as he may be, he’s not that unreasonable. And concerning the whole deal with controlling his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>…”</p>
<p id="line_1275">It’s times like these that I needed to quickly change the subject. I began to describe what had happened when Veldora was released.</p>
<p id="line_1276">“On the matter of his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I told him that ‘You’ll be super cool if you can suppress it.’ Since then, he’s been practicing hard to mask everything. It was equally tiring coaching him by myself.”</p>
<p id="line_1277">But the hard work was worth it, otherwise, I couldn’t even let Veldora outside. This was something that couldn’t be compromised on.</p>
<p id="line_1278">Likely out of admiration, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s expression shifted slightly as he gazed at me.</p>
<p id="line_1279">“I-I understand now. You are quite impressive, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I knew you had it in you.”</p>
<p id="line_1280"><em>No no no, you only came here to mooch off me. I’m not gonna be swindled by your sweet talk.</em></p>
<p id="line_1281">“The fact that <em>you</em> were able to tame Veldora is incredible,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> complimented, feeling impressed yet again.</p>
<p id="line_1282">Speaking of being selfish, Milim was worse than him. Yet, in spite of her self-centered attitude, she couldn’t even raise her head in front of Frey. Everyone had their own kryptonite, I guess.</p>
<p id="line_1283">“Veldora wasn’t the only selfish one, Milim also—”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1284">And so, I divulged to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> about my experience with Milim, how I knew her, and how egocentric she could be. Since Milim wasn’t here, I had the rare opportunity to spill my guts.</p>
<p id="line_1285">I even generously shared the mess Milim had been giving me recently to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I also revealed Veldora’s self-indulgent acts of late, since I wanted to hear his opinion regarding which one was more difficult to handle.</p>
<p id="line_1286">I ranted on and on.</p>
<p id="line_1287"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> demonstrated his enthusiasm by putting his brain on autopilot mid-way through our conversation. I was going to ask him whether Milim or Veldora was more annoying, yet wound up with no answer.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1288">And so, I brought <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to our research facility.</p>
<p id="line_1289">I glanced around in the facility to discover Veldora, who I was looking for, helping Ramiris out. Evidently, he’d been toiling away today. Despite Ramiris ordering him all over the place, this dragon was surprisingly diligent.</p>
<p id="line_1290">“V-Veldora is working…?”</p>
<p id="line_1291">“See, told you.”</p>
<p id="line_1292">While Veldora often complained about having to do work, he nevertheless decided to support Ramiris in the end. He was probably happy to be called “mentor” all day that he took a predictable liking to Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_1293">The same applied to my requests as well. Ultimately, he would agree to help out. After all, if he weren’t easily instigated and manipulated, I wouldn’t have nicknamed him Gullidora<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Volume 8 reference, Rimuru’s name pun for ‘Gullible Veldora.’" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> for nothing.</p>
<p id="line_1294">Even Vesta, who was in charge of constructing the Elemental Colossus on the ninety-fifth floor, was present. Ramiris did mention before that she was short on personnel, but was that just an excuse to make the project a priority?</p>
<p id="line_1295">Ramiris and Veldora were happily going about their business with evil grins on their faces. On the other hand, Vesta appeared utterly drained; he was practically on the verge of death.</p>
<p id="line_1296"><em>Is he all right?</em> I was kind of worried.</p>
<p id="line_1297">“Hey hey—what’s up? How’s the research going?” with a casual greeting, I entered the facility.</p>
<p id="line_1298">Upon noticing my arrival, Vesta immediately stopped writing on the document he had been busy with and stood up.</p>
<p id="line_1299">“Ahh, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s come to see us.”</p>
<p id="line_1300">“Yeah, but don’t let me distract you. Speaking of which, are you okay? You look thoroughly exhausted.”</p>
<p id="line_1301">“I’m fine is what I really want to say…but researching down here has been bad for my health…”</p>
<p id="line_1302"><em>Hmm hmm?</em> It was apparent that he wanted to get something off his chest.</p>
<p id="line_1303">Just when I was about to inquire, Veldora suddenly cut in, “Oh, it’s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I showed up to help as well. Ramiris begged me to come and help her, so I had no choice.”</p>
<p id="line_1304">“Thanks for the help. She does seem to be lacking manpower.”</p>
<p id="line_1305">My research was classified as top secret, so I couldn’t summon just anyone from level ninety-five here. I could only bring people that I wholeheartedly trusted—actually, I just wanted people who wouldn’t complain about the upcoming research.</p>
<p id="line_1306">After all, I was preparing a bunch of bodies whose sole purpose was to be possessed. And as for who was gonna possess them, those would be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, of course.</p>
<p id="line_1307">People may recognize this as a military threat rather than research.</p>
<p id="line_1308"><em>It’s best that we keep this a secret from the other nations.</em></p>
<p id="line_1309">“Yahoo! <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I’ve been waiting for you! Mentor’s support is like giving me an extra pair of wings. But I still need more help, fast!”</p>
<p id="line_1310">“I knew you’d say that, and for that reason, I brought someone new to assist you. Ramiris, don’t you know this guy too? From today onward, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, who’s also a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, is going to cooperate with us. You can rely on him for all sorts of menial tasks.”</p>
<p id="line_1311">Although <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t exactly give the impression of being an academic type, he could probably still contribute via manual labor. As an amateur, he really shouldn’t be an assistant researcher. At most, he would provide help by carrying heavy stuff or collecting data. With that being said, we definitely needed more people to do the grunt work. I thought he would be of use to some extent.</p>
<p id="line_1312"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> appeared to have taken an interest in everything, swiveling his head around to scrutinize the place. He addressed everyone after hearing my introduction.</p>
<p id="line_1313">“I’m <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Although you probably already know at this point, allow me to reiterate, I am one of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. I personally don’t want to work, but I’m being forced to contribute. I’ll be in your care now.”</p>
<p id="line_1314"><em>This person is—how should I put this?—obviously not motivated in the slightest.</em> <em>But that’s fine. At least he seems willing to lend us a hand.</em></p>
<p id="line_1315">After a general exchange of greetings, I found out the reason why Vesta was down here, and the current circumstances of his visit.</p>
<p id="line_1316">The motive for Vesta’s lengthy pilgrimage to my private research facility, located on the one-hundredth floor of the labyrinth, was due to Ramiris’s persuasion. As I had suspected, because of the lack of authorized staff, Vesta had to suspend his research and prioritize mine.</p>
<p id="line_1317">However, I also heard that Ramiris’s so-called “persuasion” was, in fact, quite effective. She didn’t care whether Vesta was available or not.</p>
<p id="line_1318">That couldn’t be helped. She needed people to handle secretarial tasks such as filing documents or collecting references.</p>
<p id="line_1319">Beretta’s schedule was already packed.</p>
<p id="line_1320"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was in charge of managing the labyrinth and taking care of Ramiris’s daily life.</p>
<p id="line_1321">Veldora didn’t carry out the aforementioned job, which was why Ramiris chose Vesta.</p>
<p id="line_1322">“Will the Elemental Colossus be okay?” I asked.</p>
<p id="line_1323">“Uh—I can’t confidently conclude that no problems will arise. But when our work here is finished, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-chan’s sisters will have bodies too. We may as well construct the Colossus at the same time.”</p>
<p id="line_1324"><em>I see, that does sound very sensible.</em></p>
<p id="line_1325">“Sorry for the trouble, Vesta,” I replied with an apology. He responded with a weak, yet somewhat enthusiastic smile.</p>
<p id="line_1326">“I am still rather disappointed in the failure of the ‘Magic Armor Soldier,’ but the research here is also…”</p>
<p id="line_1327">Vesta’s internal feelings were conflicted. On one hand, he wanted to resume with his own work, but on the other hand, he was overjoyed to participate in my project. As a researcher, Vesta’s interests seemed to be torn between the two. Just the fact that he had these inner turmoils was a testament to how far he had come along. Even now, he demonstrated an example of his maturity. He was able to overcome the initial shock of finding out that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and he was quick to regain his composure.</p>
<p id="line_1328">Since he has experienced numerous traumatic scenarios, he had grown a nearly unshakable heart. And because he was exceptionally competent, I assumed that Vesta would probably want to devote himself to his own experiments…but it appeared that I was mistaken. The contents of my project were the reason why Vesta was so exhausted.</p>
<p id="line_1329">“Please allow me to continue researching here. I want to see the bodies that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama wishes to create through to the end. There have been so many astonishing discoveries every day, to the point that I forgo sleep just so I wouldn’t miss out!” he informed me without even trying to contain his excitement. It became clear that Vesta’s exhaustion was naturally due to sleep deprivation.</p>
<p id="line_1330">Despite the ability to restore stamina with magic, the spell wasn’t omnipotent. It couldn’t just completely replace the need for sleep; you still needed to achieve a minimum amount of rest.</p>
<p id="line_1331">That was why I decided to pressure Vesta into taking a break. Because we just so happened to have a new helper, we could hand the chores to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and let Vesta get his well-deserved rest. Thus, he began giving <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> a rundown of the job he needed to do.</p>
<p id="line_1332">I hoped <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would have a good time with everyone here.</p>
<p id="line_1333">Vesta didn’t look afraid, by any means, even though he was talking to a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. His explanation was both concise and natural.</p>
<p id="line_1334">“Then <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono, I know this is all very sudden, but you will be my assistant.”</p>
<p id="line_1335">“Eh…”</p>
<p id="line_1336">“Please don’t ‘eh’ me. Come now, we are short on time!”</p>
<p id="line_1337">“But I’m a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you know?”</p>
<p id="line_1338">“So what?”</p>
<p id="line_1339">“What do you mean ‘so what’…”</p>
<p id="line_1340">“Phew,” Vesta sighed, eyes aimed at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1341">“Please hear me out. It doesn’t matter if you are a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or not here. As you can see, Veldora-sama and Ramiris-sama are both enjoying their work.”</p>
<p id="line_1342">“Yeah, it does seem that way, but—”</p>
<p id="line_1343">“How wonderful that you understand. Well then, let us begin!”</p>
<p id="line_1344">“—Okay.”</p>
<p id="line_1345">Vesta was simply phenomenal. I observed the situation for a bit and there was no indication of any issues. That was when I felt reassured to let them handle it.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1346">Now, let’s examine the intriguing results of our research.</p>
<p id="line_1347">Even though this was a reward for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, assembling almost a thousand bodies was still a monumental project. I wanted to build a magisteel doll like Beretta and replicate it with ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ But that would be dull. That said, it also wasn’t feasible to build each one from scratch. It was then that I unexpectedly thought of a better alternative: create a workshop that could mass-produce them.</p>
<p id="line_1348">I prepared a one meter wide, three-meter-high transparent cylinder made of tempered glass. I officially named it the Growth Capsule. As the name implied, the goal was to grow entities such as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> inside them.</p>
<p id="line_1349">The capsule would be filled with the water I had stored in my ‘Stomach’ from the underground lake within the ‘Sealed Cave.’ Since the lake water contained a high concentration of magicules, I decided to name it “magiwater.” It could be added to fortify our Tempest potions or even restore mana in humans. The useful properties it exhibited had a wide variety of potential applications.</p>
<p id="line_1350">The growth capsule had a pipe fitting that allowed additional magicules to be added. By inserting supplementary magicules, the density of the magiwater increased, which subsequently improved the chances of spawning a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1351">When the concentration of the magiwater dropped below the minimum threshold, the capsule would automatically refill with magicules in order to revert this change.</p>
<p id="line_1352">I prepared one thousand growth capsules. When I had finished assembling them, I suddenly realized it would have been much more convenient to simply build one thousand dolls from scratch—well, don’t sweat the small stuff. That was my belief. The point was to be romantic enough<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Refer to volume 10, ‘pursuit of romanticism’ in Japanese fiction." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>. After all, I was delighted to have worked on my project and had zero regrets.</p>
<p id="line_1353">The hall was now filled with growth capsules. Magnificent.</p>
<p id="line_1354">In order to spawn <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, specific conditions must be met first—it was thanks to our recent research that we had discovered this fact. Otherwise, no matter how many magicules we pumped into the filled capsule, no <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would spawn. However, if you were to combine certain factors, then you attained the ability to spawn strong <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as a result.</p>
<p id="line_1355">For instance, if we threw a snake into the capsule, the dense magicule concentration would poison it to death. Regardless, its flesh would combine with the magiwater and be rebuilt as a tempest serpent. And as a result, an A-minus ranked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be created. Now, you probably have some idea of just how incredible the growth capsule was.</p>
<p id="line_1356">It was evident that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> produced from the growth capsule were several times stronger than their original counterparts. The reason these <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were so strong was likely due to the fact that they were born in a stable, lab-controlled environment filled with magicules.</p>
<p id="line_1357">Despite this, sometimes an individual’s body would break down upon birth and quickly die. Whether these <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could survive was all down to luck.</p>
<p id="line_1358">There was still room for improvement, and I planned on taking advantage of the growth capsule’s properties to generate the necessary thousand bodies.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1359">“Well then, how’s progress coming along?” I inquired.</p>
<p id="line_1360">“Quite fine! I’ve also been doing a lot of research lately!” Ramiris cheerfully replied.</p>
<p id="line_1361">“Ho? Then I’ll be looking forward to—eh, what the hell is that?!”</p>
<p id="line_1362">I got spooked upon noticing the floating object inside the growth capsule. It was almost hard to believe; a complete one-eighty from what I’d expected.</p>
<p id="line_1363">For my original plan, only the skeletons of the one thousand bodies would be crafted out of magisteel, and then they would be submerged in the magicule medium. Theoretically speaking, the skeleton would be used as the foundation to form a bone golem.</p>
<p id="line_1364">Since the framework was artificial, there was little possibility of their bodies decaying. There wouldn’t be any soul possessing the bodies, either. Only the magicules in the liquid would crystalize on the skeletons. The probability that the bodies would abruptly gain self-consciousness was theoretically zero.</p>
<p id="line_1365">Unlike when I had created Beretta, they did not require detailed modelling. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> planning to acquire the bodies would no doubt use their own magicules to alter their appearance to suit personal tastes.</p>
<p id="line_1366">At least that was how I initially envisioned it…</p>
<p id="line_1367">Within the one thousand growth capsules were humanoid dolls drifting in them. However, various measures were taken to implement each essential body part. The most eye-catching one was the central component. Inside their chest was the artificial representation for the heart, the pumping ‘Spirit Magic Core.’</p>
<p id="line_1368">“This is…”</p>
<p id="line_1369">“I came up with the idea! If they have a strong enough core, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would probably be even stronger,” Ramiris casually revealed with a smirk.</p>
<p id="line_1370">In layman’s terms, it was already very difficult to prepare one thousand ‘Spirit Magic Cores.’ It wouldn’t take me too long to craft them, but with a lack of interest and passion, I considered it a chore and didn’t have the motivation to make them. That was why I wanted to resort to something simpler. Yet, Ramiris was apparently too stubborn to compromise. Looks like she did the work the traditional way to prepare the portions for one thousand bodies.</p>
<p id="line_1371">They even had ‘Emulated Souls’ installed. It seemed that the technology to possess a homunculus from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was also being utilized here.</p>
<p id="line_1372">Although Beretta easily possessed his body, if it were <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s sisters, they presumably would struggle to achieve the same result. With that being said, using ‘Emulated Souls’ was probably the right choice.</p>
<p id="line_1373">On the downside, this would obviously have led to a ton of work… No wonder why she complained about the lack of manpower.</p>
<p id="line_1374">“Ramiris-sama’s ideas were wonderful and truly intriguing. When I saw what she was trying to integrate, it would’ve been <em>impossible</em> not to assist her endeavor,” Vesta explained with distant eyes.</p>
<p id="line_1375">That was only natural. With the sheer amount of stuff here, he could have gotten as much data as he wanted.</p>
<p id="line_1376">These fist-sized ‘Spirit Magic Cores’ were all top-quality products. When combined with the skeletons I had built, the alteration greatly differed from my original design. There were even enchantments on the metallic bones. As magicules enveloped the skeleton, they began materializing as muscle tissue. We could further observe the process of how <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were born.</p>
<p id="line_1377">I finally understood why Vesta considered sleeping a waste of valuable time.</p>
<p id="line_1378">“How about it? Aren’t these all super fascinating?”</p>
<p id="line_1379">“GAHAHAHA, seeing that expression on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s face has already made it worth our time!”</p>
<p id="line_1380">Ramiris and Veldora were visibly pleased with themselves.</p>
<p id="line_1381">“Yes, it’s very interesting…but did Ramiris really come up with this?”</p>
<p id="line_1382">“Of course! Well, how about it? What do you think?!”</p>
<p id="line_1383">Apart from shouting her line, Ramiris also proudly puffed out her chest.</p>
<p id="line_1384"><em>Mhm, you can show off all you want this time. This is truly extraordinary stuff.</em></p>
<p id="line_1385">While Ramiris looked a bit ditzy at first glance, she was still intelligent. She was highly knowledgeable about spirit engineering to the point of mastery, and right now she was also learning about magic science. I heard that she’d been visiting level ninety-five quite frequently.</p>
<p id="line_1386">She didn’t just idle around during her immense, cyclic lifespan. Her proficiency in the laws of physics was exceptional. Surprisingly enough, she was fully qualified as a researcher.</p>
<p id="line_1387"><em>I can’t allow her appearance to deceive me</em>.</p>
<p id="line_1388">“Ahh, these are really impressive. And they’re all hand-crafted as well. How much work did you put in making this?”</p>
<p id="line_1389">“It was super tiring. Although they aren’t dolls with ball joints like Beretta, but rather simply bodies imitating human skeletons, if we prepare heart-emulating cores like this, I’m sure that they will absorb a large quantity of magicules when submerged in the capsule.”</p>
<p id="line_1390">I wholeheartedly agreed with a nod after listening to Ramiris’s opinion.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1391">Thus, we now had the ability to manufacture bodies that were far stronger than I had predicted. They would be the cream of the crop.</p>
<p id="line_1392">Gazing at the vessels that were suspended in the capsules, I tried to estimate their potential strength. I suspected their magicule content would be at the top of rank A—and there were a thousand of them.</p>
<p id="line_1393">This was all thanks to the integration of ‘Spirit Magic Cores’ and ‘Emulated Souls.’</p>
<p id="line_1394"><em>What an incredible feat.</em> I was thoroughly impressed from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1395">A few days had passed since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s unanticipated arrival. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had yet to return, but I suspected that it was almost time. In order to complete the bodies early, I headed to the research facility today as well.</p>
<p id="line_1396">The place was bustling with activity; Ramiris was in a heated argument with Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_1397">“Like I said, I want to pour mentor’s magicules directly into the capsules to accelerate the growth!”</p>
<p id="line_1398">“But what would happen if you messed it up? Wouldn’t all the blame get pinned on me?”</p>
<p id="line_1399"><em>These guys are up to no good.</em></p>
<p id="line_1400">Having piqued my curiosity, I concealed myself and eavesdropped on them. I had become quite skilled at hiding my presence lately. It seemed Veldora didn’t even realize I was there.</p>
<p id="line_1401">“It’s okay with so many bodies here! Moreover, I will also show support for that thing mentor wants to request from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. So pleeeese, pretty please!” Ramiris beseeched Veldora to donate some of his magicules.</p>
<p id="line_1402"><em>They sure are close.</em> I couldn’t help but smile at the scene.</p>
<p id="line_1403">By the way, what was it that Veldora wanted to request from me? I had no idea, which further piqued my curiosity.</p>
<p id="line_1404">“I just can’t get mad at you… Just remember to support me on that thing,” Veldora sighed, signaling his defeat.</p>
<p id="line_1405">“Mhm mhm, just count on me!” Ramiris hurriedly reassured.</p>
<p id="line_1406">It looked like they both came to an agreement. Veldora nodded with an ‘Mhm.’ Despite acting all pompous, his expression clearly gave away the fact that he was more than happy to do it.</p>
<p id="line_1407">On one hand, it was probably because of Ramiris’s instigation, while on the other hand, he likely would have agreed regardless.</p>
<p id="line_1408">Veldora raised his hand toward a capsule and bellowed, “HYAA!” It was quite the spectacle as he injected his magicules. The abnormally dense magicules began to swirl inside the capsule. The pressure within was so intense that it looked capable of sending the entire facility to kingdom come.</p>
<p id="line_1409"><em>Will this really work?</em></p>
<p id="line_1410">I was a bit apprehensive but continued to quietly observe with high expectations. Even if the cylinder broke, we could still revise our course of action. Compared to that, I was more curious about what Ramiris intended to accomplish.</p>
<p id="line_1411">Within the capsule, magicules crystallized and adhered to the magisteel skeleton, like moths to a flame, forming artificial tissue. Everything followed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei’s plan to a T.</p>
<p id="line_1412">But with Veldora dumping a massive quantity of magicules, unexpected side effects were bound to arise. A large amount was absorbed by the skeleton and consequently caused structural modifications.</p>
<p id="line_1413">“How strange? It seems different from what I expected…” Ramiris said, perplexed.</p>
<p id="line_1414">Well, that was usually how scientific experiments went.</p>
<p id="line_1415">The material that made up the skeleton could no longer be classified as magisteel. We didn’t mix any rare elements like gold or silver in, so it was neither orichalcum nor mithril. However, in terms of yield and tensile strength, while it was not as strong as the ultimate metal, Hihiirokane<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="ヒヒイロカネ, the author is referencing a Japanese mythical metal that is said to be harder than diamond." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>, it was strong enough to rival orichalcum.</p>
<p id="line_1416">But what bothered me the most was that despite being a type of metal, it almost looked alive…</p>
<p id="line_1417">«Answer. Deducing that the wavelength of the individual ‘Veldora’ has caused its quality to improve. It is a subset of the material adamantite. Following its classification, the corresponding name is most likely dragotite.»</p>
<p id="line_1418"><em>I see</em>.</p>
<p id="line_1419">Ramiris had attempted to speed up the completion of the bodies, only to end up discovering a new, interesting metal instead.</p>
<p id="line_1420"><em>Hold on, looks like it’s not finished yet.</em></p>
<p id="line_1421">“W-wait a second, mentor! Stop, stooop!”</p>
<p id="line_1422">“Huh? WOAHHH, there’s a crack in the capsule!”</p>
<p id="line_1423">Ramiris and Veldora both exclaimed with consternation.</p>
<p id="line_1424"><em>Are these two geniuses or idiots? By the look of things right now, I can’t tell for sure.</em></p>
<p id="line_1425">“What are you two doing?”</p>
<p id="line_1426">In order to clean up this mess before it got any bigger, I decided to reveal myself in front of the two. And so, while working to fix the damaged capsule, we grabbed some coffee to tide us over.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1427">We called Vesta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as well and gathered together to enjoy coffee and cakes. The meal was prepared by the dryad <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.</p>
<p id="line_1428">“Tsk, we were just about to get to the good part…” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> complained.</p>
<p id="line_1429">“Ah, so you don’t want your cake? Then I’ll give your share to Ramiris—”</p>
<p id="line_1430">“Sorry, I was just joking. No, wait. Even though what I said were my genuine feelings, it was just a slip of the tongue.”</p>
<p id="line_1431"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s reaction implied that he was pissed off about being interrupted while working. Yet, when I suggested taking his cake away, he immediately lowered his head and apologized.</p>
<p id="line_1432"><em>Are you really okay being like this, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san? Are you really living up to the name “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sleeping Ruler" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>”…?</em></p>
<p id="line_1433">Still, seeing that he was at least putting effort in reassured me a lot.</p>
<p id="line_1434">Vesta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were performing experiments together. I was told that they were recording data from the one thousand growth capsules. Additionally, when they had spare time, they left to examine <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s slotted weapons and his interchangeable magic crystal enchantments.</p>
<p id="line_1435">The reason for their sudden interest was because I bragged about it.</p>
<p id="line_1436">If the outcome of the research went well, it may even contribute to the construction of the Elemental Colossus. That explained why Vesta was eager to start his own investigation on Magic Marble Combination.</p>
<p id="line_1437">I gave <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> a couple of magic marbles as samples to play around with, while Vesta would observe and jot down detailed notes. Noticing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s displeasure when I called him over to relax with us, it became obvious that he was enjoying research. It was work, but the line between work and play had blurred. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would go on some tangent about not wanting to be productive, yet he seemed to have already assimilated into this professional workplace without realizing.</p>
<p id="line_1438">It is imperative to enjoy your work.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1439">Next—</p>
<p id="line_1440">As I finished the last of my coffee, I turned to face Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_1441">“By the way, Ramiris, why were you in such a hurry to complete the bodies for possession?” I asked rather directly.</p>
<p id="line_1442">“Ah, about that…” Ramiris was dodging the question.</p>
<p id="line_1443">Coming to her aid, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san interjected, “Please hold on, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. Ramiris-sama was doing this for my sisters and companions. She was simply trying her best for them!”</p>
<p id="line_1444">I didn’t mean to chide her, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san mistook my intentions and tried very hard to defend her.

To be honest, I thought <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san outright spoiled Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_1445">“It’s not that, I just wanted to know her reasons. I’m not scolding her, don’t worry. So, why did you do it, Ramiris?”</p>
<p id="line_1446">I attempted to calm <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san down and continued to question Ramiris for her rationale.</p>
<p id="line_1447">“Umm—now that I have some time to think it over, I was being too rash. These children admire me a lot, so I wanted them to get their own bodies earlier. This way, they would be happy, and we would also get extra help. The more the merrier, right?”</p>
<p id="line_1448">Ramiris was quite embarrassed as she answered.</p>
<p id="line_1449">I could empathize with her motivation. The dryads could move freely around the labyrinth without a body, whereas the treants couldn’t. Although treants retained the ability to reposition near where they were rooted, they couldn’t possibly leave the forest and enter areas without soil. Essentially, without a body, their mana would steadily dissipate over time, which was detrimental to their well-being.</p>
<p id="line_1450">The same concept applied to the dryads, where if they were too far away from their corpus, then their strength would greatly diminish as well. They were considered high tier species among the rank A <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and much stronger than <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. If the same restrictions also applied to the dryads, then demanding more from the treants, a lower species, would be far too cruel.</p>
<p id="line_1451">From Ramiris’s point of view, with the dolls that were cultivated in the growth capsules, not only the dryads, but even the treants would possess the capability to effortlessly travel in the future. That was probably why she wanted to test her idea out on some of the dolls behind my back.</p>
<p id="line_1452">“If that’s the case, you could have discussed it with me. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> hasn’t come back yet, and there’s no telling how many subordinates that guy will bring. If there aren’t enough, we can always make more later. Let’s first prepare the bodies for the dryads,” I suggested with a genial tone.</p>
<p id="line_1453">“Can we really?” Ramiris excitedly inquired.</p>
<p id="line_1454">“Of course.”</p>
<p id="line_1455">“Thank you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>
<p id="line_1456">She flitted around me, overjoyed.</p>
<p id="line_1457">To be fair, this decision was also made with my best interests in mind. We truly lacked the number of people necessary to operate efficiently. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s sisters, as well as the other dryads, were all assisting with running the labyrinth and its related matters. They were already busy enough as is and couldn’t spare any more time. If this were to continue, everyone would be overworked since administering the labyrinth required twenty-four-seven attention. That was why I desperately needed more staff to fill in the shifts.</p>
<p id="line_1458">With these state-of-the-art bodies, even the treants would rise to rank A and be able to move unhindered inside the labyrinth. Furthermore, in the rare case that their bodies were destroyed, their original corpus wouldn’t be harmed. However, they could only travel as far as their willpower allowed—in essence, only within the confines of Ramiris’s labyrinth—but that was sufficient.</p>
<p id="line_1459">As for the dryads—</p>
<p id="line_1460">“By the way, we should turn <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Trya" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Triss" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Alpha, and the rest of the dryads all into dryas dolls—”</p>
<p id="line_1461">“Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_1462">“Is it really okay?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san launched her question at me with terrifying fervor, all before I could even finish my proposal.</p>
<p id="line_1463">“Can we really do that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?” Ramiris nervously asked, completely ignoring <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others who were unfortunately left out of the discussion.</p>
<p id="line_1464">“Can we do what?”</p>
<p id="line_1465">“That—evolving them into dryas doll dryads<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="This race is first mentioned in volume 6, for Yenpress LN readers, they mistranslated this to ‘Between the dryas, the doll and the dryad.’" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>. But won’t that take a lot of work?”</p>
<p id="line_1466">“I suppose, but they’ve also contributed their fair share. I hope they will continue to help us with the labyrinth’s management in the future as well.”</p>
<p id="line_1467">“All because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama allowed us to live here… Since Ramiris-sama is determined to support <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, we naturally will follow Ramiris-sama’s wishes as her subordinates,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san admitted.</p>
<p id="line_1468">After hearing my reply to Ramiris, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san seemed rather guilty.</p>
<p id="line_1469">With that being said, we benefited tremendously from the dryads’ involvement within the labyrinth. In a sense, this was my token of appreciation for them. I wanted to give them the opportunity to act on their own. Although it required handcrafting humanoid dolls, I was quite keen on matters involving creating dolls for beauties or bishojos.</p>
<p id="line_1470">I originally planned on using the same bodies I had prepared for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but that would seem like a cheap gesture. Dryads should use wooden dolls.</p>
<p id="line_1471">“No no no, you guys really helped out a lot, so please enjoy these. And whether they wish to directly possess these bodies or become a dryas doll dryad by possessing extra wood from their original tree host, the choice will be up to them,” I proposed to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.</p>
<p id="line_1472">She nodded happily.</p>
<p id="line_1473">Ramiris muttered on the side, “Hey you, why are you more polite talking to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-chan than to me? I won’t take that…”</p>
<p id="line_1474">But I’ll just pretend I never heard that.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1475">As soon as break time was over, Vesta and the others returned to work.</p>
<p id="line_1476">“Looks like this place is beyond my field of expertise, but it’s still very fun. I’ll go finish my <em>work</em> now. Let’s go, Vesta-san.”</p>
<p id="line_1477">“Understood, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_1478">And somewhere along the line, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> put emphasis on the word “work” as he left with Vesta.</p>
<p id="line_1479">This guy had clearly never done anything productive until he came here. He was a waste of space before, but since he’d been working hard, I would overlook his past behavior. Speaking of which, I needed to work on my own stuff as well—</p>
<p id="line_1480">“Hold on, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I have something to ask of you. Ramiris, it’s time to fulfill your part of the bargain!”</p>
<p id="line_1481">I guessed that he was going to trouble me with something, so I was trying to run away. It appeared Veldora had been waiting for the moment right after break time ended.</p>
<p id="line_1482">“…And what is it that you need me for?”</p>
<p id="line_1483">Truthfully, I really didn’t wanna do it, but I still begrudgingly replied, nonetheless.</p>
<p id="line_1484">“Umm, the thing is—”</p>
<p id="line_1485">“Mentor said he wanted an assistant. It will be a good thing if we have more people to help, that’s why I also…well, have a favor to ask…”</p>
<p id="line_1486">Uhh, my ominous feeling came true! More hassle was headed my way…</p>
<p id="line_1487"><em>We’re already understaffed right now, so who could we possibly spare to be Veldora’s playmate?</em></p>
<p id="line_1488">“No no no, everyone is very busy. They don’t have time to hang out with you—”</p>
<p id="line_1489">“Wait a second! <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you got it all wrong. I have been helping Ramiris and guarding the labyrinth, all very important tasks. If I can have an assistant at my side and praise me from time to time, then it will have quite the therapeutic effect. That way, I won’t be exhausted quickly,” Veldora passionately argued.</p>
<p id="line_1490">Ramiris displayed her support with vigorous nods. However, since I already heard every bit of their conversation just moments ago, I could only think “You really do stick to your end of the bargain.” But, since no one available came to mind, I would have to end that train of thought.</p>
<p id="line_1491">“No. Unfortunately—”</p>
<p id="line_1492">“Hold on, hold on, hold on—!”</p>
<p id="line_1493">I was interrupted yet again.</p>
<p id="line_1494">Veldora apparently did not want to back off. He was adamantly standing his ground.</p>
<p id="line_1495">“To be honest, when I was staying inside your ‘Stomach,’ I met someone whom I can call a friend. I hope that you can give him a body just like the ones you are preparing here,” Veldora suddenly revealed.</p>
<p id="line_1496">I was clueless. <em>What kind of friend are you talking about here?</em></p>
<p id="line_1497">«Answer. The individual is deduced to be the greater spirit ‘Ifrit.’»</p>
<p id="line_1498"><em>Huh? How did Veldora befriend Ifrit?</em></p>
<p id="line_1499">«Answer. Individual ‘Veldora’ intervened at the time to move Ifrit to the same isolated position during Master’s ‘Predation.’»</p>
<p id="line_1500"><em>I see, it is exactly what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san described</em>.</p>
<p id="line_1501">When I consumed Ifrit from Shizu-san, he was moved to the space in my ‘Stomach’ where Veldora had been isolated. This, however, did not affect us from taking Ifrit’s data. That’s why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei, or ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Great Sage" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ at the time, did not resist the change and allowed it without notifying me. Since it wasn’t an inconvenience, I only discovered this fact just now. That is to say, unbeknownst to me, Veldora befriended Ifrit.</p>
<p id="line_1502">“Ahh, so you want me to revive Ifrit?”</p>
<p id="line_1503">“GAHAHAHA! As expected from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you understood me so quickly!”</p>
<p id="line_1504">Veldora-san was delighted, but on the other hand, I had mixed feelings. Ifrit and Shizu-san were totally incompatible with each other, and he was also <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon’s subordinate. If I were to revive Ifrit, would he play nice? With this thought in mind, I couldn’t just agree to his proposal so easily.</p>
<p id="line_1505">“Hmm…”</p>
<p id="line_1506">“S-so that’s a no?”</p>
<p id="line_1507">“R-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I want to ask you too! Please fulfill mentor’s wish!”</p>
<p id="line_1508">While I deliberated, Veldora gazed at me with sad puppy eyes whereas Ramiris pleaded for her mentor’s sake.</p>
<p id="line_1509">What a headache. I was quite troubled with this turn of events.</p>
<p id="line_1510">To be honest, I preferred having more people to work for us, but I just didn’t feel safe releasing Ifrit. Despite his modest appearance, he was still head and shoulders above any second-rate <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in terms of strength. Although we would win if he were to start a fuss, damage would be inevitable. He might even wind end up fleeing back to Leon. I wouldn’t want to wake a sleeping baby—I figured it was understandable for me to think this way.</p>
<p id="line_1511">“However, Ifrit seemed to have pledged his loyalty to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon before… Are you really sure he’s willing to be your assistant after being revived?”</p>
<p id="line_1512">“Uh? Umm umm, that’s definitely the case. You don’t have to worry about it. My sincerity has moved Ifrit. That guy really is willing to be my assistant,” Veldora hurriedly reassured.</p>
<p id="line_1513"><em>Oi. Seriously?</em></p>
<p id="line_1514">For a brief second, Veldora seemed like he was talking to someone; it had to be Ifrit himself. In other words, Veldora was communicating with him in my body in some unknown fashion.</p>
<p id="line_1515">“Were you just talking to Ifrit?”</p>
<p id="line_1516">“Yeah, I can do anything.”</p>
<p id="line_1517">“Mentor is super amazing. He asked Ifrit to summon a bunch of flame salamanders for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! That’s why we should plan for the future and make him one of our companions,” trilled Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_1518"><em>I see how it is.</em></p>
<p id="line_1519">Indeed, within the labyrinth itself, Ramiris could summon spirits at will with ease. However, once the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> commenced operations, it would be much more reassuring if someone could actually command the salamanders. <em>Guuhh</em>, I really couldn’t refuse the proposal from a profit standpoint. Moreover, Veldora personally guaranteed that he would take care of Ifrit.</p>
<p id="line_1520"><em>I suppose I will put my faith in Veldora.</em></p>
<p id="line_1521">“All right, all right, since you are so convinced, just make sure you take responsibility for the whole thing!”</p>
<p id="line_1522">“All right, just leave it to me!”</p>
<p id="line_1523">“This is great, Mentor!”</p>
<p id="line_1524">Veldora and Ramiris were hyped up like I was going to buy them a pet or something. Hopefully, my faith in Veldora being responsible wouldn’t backfire.</p>
<p id="line_1525">“Then let’s—”</p>
<p id="line_1526">“Right, right, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Don’t we still have the shell of the magic core of Charybdis? That contains the remainder of my mana, so it can adapt to my power easily. Ifrit has been submerged in my <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> for a long time, so using that as a ‘Core’ would be better.”</p>
<p id="line_1527">According to Veldora, the compatibility would work better than an ‘Emulated Soul.’</p>
<p id="line_1528">«Answer. I agree with the views of individual ‘Veldora.’»</p>
<p id="line_1529">Since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had agreed, I had no reason to object.</p>
<p id="line_1530">“Okay, then we will use this body for Ifrit to take over.”</p>
<p id="line_1531">I stood in front of the growth capsule that had just been repaired before our break.</p>
<p id="line_1532">A skeleton originally made of magisteel, which had transformed into a unique metal called dragotite, was floating inside. Inferior beings wouldn’t be able to endure the exposure to Veldora’s excessive magicules. However, since Ifrit was a greater spirit, he should be able to hold his own.</p>
<p id="line_1533">“Oh ho, this is great. That guy will be happy as well,” Veldora assured as well.</p>
<p id="line_1534">I began to execute the conversion without hesitation.</p>
<p id="line_1535">«Report. Remains of Ifrit have been discovered. Transferring to the magic core of Charybdis… Successful. Proceeding to phase two, constructing soul container… ‘Merging’ with the body made up of dragotite.»</p>
<p id="line_1536">The operation was completed in an instant.</p>
<p id="line_1537">As expected from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei, how masterful.</p>
<p id="line_1538">The next moment—</p>
<p id="line_1539">After Veldora, Ramiris, and I watched the body receive Ifrit’s core, its form underwent drastic changes. Muscles and blood vessels started growing on the silver black skeleton. Skin quickly formed the final layer, and just like Veldora, it had a tanned hue. Its head was veiled with wavy long hair, whose black color gave off an impressive sheen. There were highlights of red intertwined, like a burning flame was scattered within. It had golden eyes, while its dragon-like pupils glowed a deep scarlet.</p>
<p id="line_1540">Eh, no matter how you looked at it, that figure was a female. And a superb beauty as well.</p>
<p id="line_1541">“Oh oh, Ifrit, how does it feel to return to the mortal realm with a body?” commented Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_1542">Ah, so this femme fatale was undeniably Ifrit. Putting aside whether spirits really possessed genders, I explicitly remembered that it had a more <em>masculine</em> body type. How did this change happen?</p>
<p id="line_1543">“Veldora-sama, this is the first time I have seen you in this world. And <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I am eternally grateful for you resurrecting me.”</p>
<p id="line_1544">Despite my confusion, Ifrit kneeled as soon as she finished speaking. I was afraid that Ifrit would rebel out of her loyalty for Leon, but it seemed that I had worried for nothing. Immense relief flooded through me.</p>
<p id="line_1545">“Oh, oh oh, I’m glad you look well. But I want to ask you something…” I wavered for a moment.</p>
<p id="line_1546">“Please ask away.”</p>
<p id="line_1547">I had so many questions. However, what I was most curious about—</p>
<p id="line_1548">“I recall that your previous look was more suited for combat, I mean, you looked a lot more agile moving around…”</p>
<p id="line_1549"><em>And you didn’t have gigantic breasts like those, right?</em></p>
<p id="line_1550">—I didn’t dare say the last line out loud. I didn’t have the audacity.</p>
<p id="line_1551">You couldn’t exactly blame me for thinking this way. Ifrit only had a few thin articles of clothing that covered her private areas. She was aiming for a super-hot belly dancer outfit. Her elbows, belly, thighs were all exposed, which came off as really erotic.</p>
<p id="line_1552">“Are you referring to this look…”</p>
<p id="line_1553">Upon saying so, Ifrit suddenly sighed for some reason.</p>
<p id="line_1554">“I am afraid this was Veldora-sama’s fau—I mean his will.”</p>
<p id="line_1555">She wanted to say, ‘It was Veldora’s fault,’ didn’t she?</p>
<p id="line_1556">Ifrit seemed a bit worn out, and I got the impression that she was wholly exasperated. Could it be that she’s been suffering the whole time in my ‘Stomach’? Now that I thought about it, Ifrit had been alone with Veldora for approximately two years with no means of escape. I was pretty sure she had a rough time.</p>
<p id="line_1557">“Hmph! It was thanks to me that you got a body. Do remember to be grateful!” Veldora reproached.</p>
<p id="line_1558">“—Understood.”</p>
<p id="line_1559">Ifrit’s reply sounded rather forced.</p>
<p id="line_1560">“You said it was the will of Veldora. What did you mean by that?” I inquired, wanting clarification.</p>
<p id="line_1561">“Hmm?”</p>
<p id="line_1562">“Oh, about that. Even though I am a greater fire elemental spirit, now I can somehow wield wind elemental power as well. My hair should have been red, yet for some reason its color is mostly dark. I believe that Veldora-sama’s power has influenced it greatly. Furthermore, it may have been because the Charybdis was a female that I ended up looking like this.”</p>
<p id="line_1563">«Report. Correct.»</p>
<p id="line_1564"><em>She got it right?! Oi oi, can you really change something like gender this casually?</em></p>
<p id="line_1565">I didn’t mean to offend her, so hopefully she wouldn’t hate me for it.</p>
<p id="line_1566">“W-well, if you are not satisfied with it—”</p>
<p id="line_1567">“How could I be unsatisfied. Putting aside my appearance, I have become far stronger than I had ever been before,” Ifrit declared while cracking a brilliant smile.</p>
<p id="line_1568">Veldora had probably teased her so much to the point where she had grown accustomed to it. She seemed to be tremendously adaptable. It also made her quite affable. Unlike when she was fused with Shizu-san, I couldn’t sense any malicious intent from Ifrit anymore.</p>
<p id="line_1569">“Do you not hate me?”</p>
<p id="line_1570">“No, how could I hate you? Veldora-sama taught me <em>many</em> things while I was trapped inside <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. Thinking back, the sense of duty and responsibility Shizue Izawa and I both shared was very strong. However, our ideologies were diametrically opposed, and so we weren’t able to build any other connections. I can’t help but think that maybe we could have changed the way we treated each other.”</p>
<p id="line_1571">It looked like Ifrit genuinely didn’t harbor even the slightest trace of resentment against me. She was even regretful to have never opened her heart up to Shizu-san. I couldn’t help but feel saddened.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1572">We decided to go to a different venue to discuss plans for the future.</p>
<p id="line_1573">Thus, I chatted with Ifrit for a while. Just as I suspected, she truly had endured arduous hardships. Before I knew it, she grew on me.</p>
<p id="line_1574">If I were to appoint anyone to deal with Veldora, then I would appoint her without hesitation. She was still reminiscent of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon, but not to the point of pledging her loyalty to him again.</p>
<p id="line_1575">“Even though <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama defeated and almost killed me, I was lucky enough to have been saved by Veldora-sama so that my consciousness wasn’t erased. That said, I am self-aware now as well, and I feel different from before. I still think that Leon-sama is an incredible <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but I wish to pledge my loyalty to Veldora-sama now,” she explained, clearly expressing her will.</p>
<p id="line_1576">I believed Ifrit was worthy of my trust, and besides, Veldora seemed to have complete confidence in her from the beginning. I probably didn’t need to worry that much.</p>
<p id="line_1577">“I understand. Then please continue to work hard in the future as Veldora’s assistant!”</p>
<p id="line_1578">“Yes sir. I am willing to give it my all and pledge my loyalty to Veldora-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_1579">Ifrit sure was serious.</p>
<p id="line_1580">I still felt kind of bugged with the whole ordeal regarding Shizu-san. But since Ifrit had shown remorse, it was all water under the bridge.</p>
<p id="line_1581">And so, I decided to accept Ifrit.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1582">“By the way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I have something else to discuss with you,” Veldora slyly added.</p>
<p id="line_1583"><em>What is it again?!</em></p>
<p id="line_1584">I legitimately did not want to deal with any more of these annoyances. Yet if I ignored him, he’d probably nag me to death.</p>
<p id="line_1585">“What is it, Veldora-kun?”</p>
<p id="line_1586">“Um! Here’s the thing, I want to name Ifrit. You see, ‘Ifrit’ is an individual name, but at the same time it’s not. That’s because all the greater fire elemental spirits summoned through the Spirit Summoning ‘Flame Giant Ifrit’ are called Ifrit…”</p>
<p id="line_1587">Wow, a surprisingly serious suggestion. A name, indeed, was warranted. However—‘Naming’ could be very dangerous. Now, even if I, who had experienced several <em>miscalculations</em> during naming, was saying this, then you knew it was credible.</p>
<p id="line_1588">“Won’t it be dangerous naming Ifrit now? Your magicule content is huge, but there’s gonna be a big problem if you don’t know how much to give!”</p>
<p id="line_1589">Giving too many magicules had the same effect as poisoning, and the one being named would be in danger as well. The fact that no accidents happened during my namings was purely due to good luck.</p>
<p id="line_1590">“GAHAHAHA, but I can leave all that to you, right? If I were to give away too much, you should be able to cut me off with our ‘Soul Corridor.”’</p>
<p id="line_1591"><em>Hmm, that would indeed be safer.</em></p>
<p id="line_1592">«Report. Please leave it to me.»</p>
<p id="line_1593">Welp, since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said so, we should be fine.</p>
<p id="line_1594">“Very well, I shall assist you,” I declared.</p>
<p id="line_1595">“Oh, I knew you’d say so!”</p>
<p id="line_1596">And so, Veldora named Ifrit.</p>
<p id="line_1597">“Ifrit, from today onward you shall be known as ‘Charys’!” he proclaimed in a majestic tone.</p>
<p id="line_1598">Charys—that would be Ifrit’s name. Clearly, the name Charys had nothing to do with Ifrit, but instead was an abridged version of Charybdis. Although, in my honest opinion, a name like ‘Irys’ would have been more fitting. However, it would’ve been a bit too rude to interject now.</p>
<p id="line_1599">Through the ‘Soul Corridor,’ I observed a large amount of magicules disappear from Veldora’s body.</p>
<p id="line_1600">Ifrit’s magicule content was already at Special rank A—meaning she rivaled the strength of a Calamity-class <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. While she was weaker than <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, she could put up an even fight against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And now that Ifrit received a name—</p>
<p id="line_1601">“Understood. I shall henceforth be known as ‘Charys.’ I pledge my loyalty to the servitude of the great Veldora-sama!”</p>
<p id="line_1602">Ifrit accepted her ‘name.’ At that instant, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> shutdown ‘Soul Corridor’ and cut off Veldora’s power.</p>
<p id="line_1603">It worked. Veldora successfully named Ifrit. The flame giant began to evolve—it was practically exploding with magicules, rapidly reaching the level of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-class. Ifrit not only surpassed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, but seemed to have even surpassed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Frey.</p>
<p id="line_1604">«Report. Greater spirit ‘Flame Giant Ifrit’ has evolved into ‘Flame Lord.’»</p>
<p id="line_1605"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san dutifully notified me.</p>
<p id="line_1606"><em>A flame lord, you say?</em></p>
<p id="line_1607">This race was a spiritual life-form that gained a physical body through monsterfication—essentially, exposure to a massive amount of magicules.</p>
<p id="line_1608">“GAHAHAHA! Well done! I knew I could count on you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_1609">Veldora-san sounded particularly pleased, yet he frowned as soon as he saw Ifrit. Her appearance had greatly altered once again. Or rather, it was restored to its original form. Its hair was still the same pattern of black and red, but its body had reverted back to more masculine proportions. Although some changes remained, Ifrit’s will might have strongly influenced this physical transformation.</p>
<p id="line_1610">“Tsk, and I went the extra mile for fun—I mean, I thought you’d look better, so I made you beautiful. I never knew it’d turn out like this,” Veldora complained.</p>
<p id="line_1611">So it was his fault, after all.</p>
<p id="line_1612">Ifrit—I mean, Charys, sighed in resignation, “I see that it was true. I should have guessed so. Luckily, my will has triumphed, which is reassuring. That said, I can change back to my female form if you were to insist…”</p>
<p id="line_1613">“No need, no need, I was just joking around. I won’t complain if you can maintain your preferred form!”</p>
<p id="line_1614">Veldora’s jokes were so lame.</p>
<p id="line_1615">Even though Charys successfully restored his appearance, he had the option of reverting back to his old look. I needed to be careful in the future as well.</p>
<p id="line_1616">“How are you feeling?”</p>
<p id="line_1617">“I feel very good, my lord—eh, t-this is?!”</p>
<p id="line_1618">After my question, Charys suddenly realized the change in his body. Dazed, he began to confirm his strength.</p>
<p id="line_1619">“S-such tremendous power…”</p>
<p id="line_1620">He was taken aback by his own power.</p>
<p id="line_1621">“Kukuku, you got that right.”</p>
<p id="line_1622">Veldora-san gave off a satisfied smile like he had predicted this outcome.</p>
<p id="line_1623">“About your race, you apparently evolved into a flame lord,” I casually added.</p>
<p id="line_1624">“Y-you said flame lord?! I cannot believe that I now wield such power…”</p>
<p id="line_1625">I suppose he really couldn’t. To suddenly gain the strength to rival those of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-class immediately after being resurrected, it was no wonder he had such a reaction.</p>
<p id="line_1626">Despite the fact that you became this strong, your job was still to take care of Veldora. In addition, if you were to become too powerful, you had to be wary of Veldora exploiting you even more. I was becoming somewhat sympathetic to our new addition.</p>
<p id="line_1627">And so, we gained a new companion by the name of Charys.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1628">It wasn’t long before Charys settled in and immediately began being exploited by both Veldora and Ramiris. Although my worries came true, he didn’t seem to mind, so I guess it was fine. With this new assistant, our efficiency in researching improved significantly.</p>
<p id="line_1629">“Um, since when did we get such a tough guy as our new member?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked, dumbfounded.</p>
<p id="line_1630">“When you were still addicted to playing with magic marble combinations,” I replied.</p>
<p id="line_1631">“No no no, you made it sound so simple! This is a spirit lord that can rival <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s we’re talking about here!”</p>
<p id="line_1632">“Actually, it’s a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> spirit lord.”</p>
<p id="line_1633">“Whatever! I don’t give a crap what type of ‘lord’ it is! That’s not my point!”</p>
<p id="line_1634"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the only one who was shocked. Meanwhile, everyone else was already accustomed to this sort of outcome.</p>
<p id="line_1635">“Ah ah, don’t get so worked up now. This type of thing just happens, you know?” added Vesta.</p>
<p id="line_1636">“No, but—Vesta-san?”</p>
<p id="line_1637">Ramiris also comforted <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> by saying: “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-chan, you shouldn’t be surprised at trivial things like these while spending time with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Mentor.”</p>
<p id="line_1638">“But, that’s…”</p>
<p id="line_1639"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wasn’t capable of accepting this reality. However, he finally relented after everyone talked it out with him.</p>
<p id="line_1640">You get used to it. Sometimes, it was better to not overthink things.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1641">Afterwards, I began cutting down the necessary wood to craft dolls and evolve the dryads into dryas doll dryads. Unlike their original counterparts, these dryas doll dryads could wield their true strength even when they were far from their roots.</p>
<p id="line_1642">No one was against the idea of evolving, either.</p>
<p id="line_1643">And so, the number of dryas doll dryads we had increased to nearly ten. They didn’t have any combat experience, and none of them was stronger than <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. However, they had plenty of opportunities to train in the labyrinth. In the near foreseeable future, they would surely become capable servants of Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_1644">In addition, the bodies that I wanted to lend to the treants—or rather, the humanoid dolls—were also near completion. These bodies were only being used for possession, so it didn’t really matter whether they were strong or not.</p>
<p id="line_1645">There were no issues with compatibility either. With this, around a hundred plus several dozen treants would be able to roam inside the labyrinth. I regretted the fact that we didn’t start recruitment much earlier. We would have secured a considerable number of capable people from the start.</p>
<p id="line_1646">The dryads were mostly in female forms while the treants were mostly male. Since they were spirits, they didn’t seem to have specific genders. That was why I focused more on efficiency when crafting the dolls. The treants could modify the details to suit their own tastes when they possessed them.</p>
<p id="line_1647">Once we were finished, they began the transfer almost immediately. With some minor work here and there, the operation was finally complete. Now with all the new helpers, we wouldn’t be that busy anymore.</p>
<p id="line_1648">“Thank you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama!”</p>
<p id="line_1649">I shook my head as I heard <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san thanking me. This was really nothing. I had always wanted to express my gratitude for all the help they provided.</p>
<p id="line_1650">“Well then, I’ll be counting on you guys in the future as well. Ramiris, report to me if anything happens.”</p>
<p id="line_1651">“Roger that! I’ll fly straight away to inform you.”</p>
<p id="line_1652">I told her to notify me should any problems arise.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1653">There was still some work at hand for me to do.</p>
<p id="line_1654">For one, I had to attend daily meetings with Rigurd and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to make executive decisions. Even criminal trials required my verdict now. It was also my duty to mediate disputes between my lieutenants. I genuinely wanted to help out with the research here, but reality often intervened. I desperately needed to scout some talent that would alleviate my workload—that was my task at hand. I could still find time for my hobbies since I technically didn’t require sleep, but sometimes you just wanna slack off for a bit, ya know? And I thought I was all mouth and no trousers, but it looked like I was really diligent after all.</p>
<p id="line_1655">While feeling a sense of doubt towards this statement, I headed back to my office.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>

He wishes to see you; what should we do?”</p>
<p id="line_1657">The long-awaited news had finally arrived.</p>
<p id="line_1658">Now if it were only <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, then he would have just casually strolled in.

<p id="line_1659"><em>Let me see them right now before <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> catches wind of this and wants to greet them together.</em></p>
<p id="line_1660">“I shall meet them in the reception room. Summon them immediately!”</p>
<p id="line_1661">The attendant bowed respectfully before leaving. Her movements were rather stiff. She must have felt very nervous around me. I thought to myself, <em>this really can’t be helped,</em> before asking the other attendant waiting next door to prepare some tea.</p>

She seemed to be examining just how difficult it was to kill them, and thus was conducting extremely rigorous training. I heard that they were currently residing in the lower levels, so I shouldn’t bother them if nothing important came up.</p>
<p id="line_1664">This was why I had two attendants serving me now. Even though they were goblinas that had evolved from goblins, they were indistinguishable from humans. Recently, some simple cosmetic items that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had developed were growing popular as well. This was probably why our female citizens were becoming ever more beautiful.</p>
<p id="line_1665">Had I not been their master, they’d probably be top-tier servants who wouldn’t even break a sweat when confronted with foreign dignitaries. Their skills were masterful.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1666">I began moving towards the reception room—the sturdy one, by the way. Despite the fact that I figured nothing would go wrong, it was always better safe than sorry.

<p id="line_1719">Seeing his reaction, the three demonesses snickered among themselves.

<p id="line_1720">Knowing that my judgement was correct sure was satisfying. I spoke again with a grin, “It’s inappropriate to let the others wait so long, so do introduce them as well.”</p>

<p id="line_1723">I’ll admit that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was an outstanding subordinate, but giving him treats like this in front of our new recruits would be a very bad influence. I couldn’t let people think that I was endorsing nepotism with him, so he would have to endure it for a bit. And of course, I didn’t want to waste time listening to him blabbering on and on—but since these were my genuine thoughts, there was no need to say them out loud.</p>

<p id="line_1732">Speaking of which, his words did remind me about something.

<p id="line_1734">Moreover, it would prevent the casting of unauthorized magic and protect the town from wild <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

And even if they weren’t, they still wouldn’t be able to just destroy it instantly. If anything abnormal were to happen to the barrier, we would notice right away. During that time, the guards would take care of the problem. Speaking of A ranked magic beasts, they weren’t a threat if they were non-intelligent.

<p id="line_1764">The three ladies who arrived first were among the ruling class, so let’s assume the six <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s here were younger than the ancient species.

<p id="line_1765">I had no clue before, but it looked like I had gotten my hands on an incredible companion. This realization sent shivers down my spine.

<p id="line_1775">The method was simple.</p>
<p id="line_1776">First, use ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gluttonous King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Beelzebuth" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ to predate on the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_1777">Of course, the result was a resounding success.

<p id="line_1778">However, there were problems with the three demonesses. I felt that it was inappropriate to give them the same treatment as their subordinates.

<p id="line_1779">It was time for me, a scholar of beauty, to shine.

<p id="line_1780">“Do you need me to adjust the appearance for you?” I offered.</p>
<p id="line_1781">“Could you really?”</p>
<p id="line_1782">“That would be great.”</p>
<p id="line_1783">“Then, please indeed help us with it.”</p>
<p id="line_1784">The white-haired beauty smiled and accepted my proposal. The other two, witnessing this, also allowed me to amend their bodies for them.</p>
<p id="line_1785">I readily agreed and commenced with modifications. It was a difficult task to change the exterior while preventing the skeletons from being affected. However, with my hands’ precise movements and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s flawless calculations, re-sculpting the three demonesses’ appearances was relatively straightforward. For them, once they grew accustomed to their skeletons, they would be able to control the flow of their own magicules and perfectly reproduce their self-image.</p>
<p id="line_1786">I could also slip them some extra goodies. I mixed gold into the magisteel skeletons and turned them into orichalcum.

Gold was a widely used universal metal in this world as well. Its compatibility with magicules was excellent. In addition, not only its strength, but also its overall quality was above that of magisteel.</p>

<p id="line_1797">“Actually, I’ve heard about all that…”</p>
<p id="line_1798"><em>Then why are you so surprised if you’ve already heard about it?</em></p>
<p id="line_1799">“This is another miraculous sight. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sure is incredible, to suddenly assemble so many <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_1800">Ah, it was because of the large gathering. Indeed, there definitely were a lot of them.

<p id="line_1801">“No, that’s not all.

<p id="line_1802">“Oh, they appear to be the ancient species of the ruling class. They apparently have lived over a thousand years,” I added.</p>
<p id="line_1803">“Eh…?”</p>
<p id="line_1804">“Did you make a mistake somehow?”</p>
<p id="line_1805"><em>What mistake?

<p id="line_1806">«…Negative. It is a misunderstanding. Because there is no knowing the precise time and year of their existence, the deduction is purely speculative. The so-called ‘lived for over a thousand years’ can even include those who have remained alive for over thirty thousand years.»</p>
<p id="line_1807">I see, this was the correct definition<em>.</em> The one description, ‘lived for over a thousand years,’ included three thousand, four thousand, and even ten thousand years. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t make a mistake, but it wasn’t necessarily the correct interpretation either.</p>
<p id="line_1808">“Hmm—even if you guys say so…it’s inappropriate to ask a girl her age,” warned Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_1809">“GAHAHAHA, I learned about this lesson as well. It will make you seem like a troublemaker and piss people off,” Veldora boasted.</p>
<p id="line_1810">“In any case, how long they’ve lived isn’t that important.

<p id="line_1818">The first female had exquisitely shining white hair and snow-like pale skin.

<p id="line_1822">It was too late to give advice like that now. There was no use panicking at this point.</p>
<p id="line_1823">Look at Ramiris and Veldora; they weren’t the slightest bit freaked out—</p>

Since there’s three of you here, do any of you wish to fill in these roles?”</p>
<p id="line_1931">It felt as if I was forcing the girls to accept, but I casually brought it up as an option, nonetheless.</p>

<p id="line_1947">“Listen now. As the military attaché, you will act as a representative for the Western States Council and speak on my behalf.

<p id="line_2008">“Y-yes sir. The nations neighboring the south of Tempest, centered around the Kingdom of Blumund, were all in favor of our nation. Yet, relevant knowledge of our nation has not yet spread to the northern realm. It seems that many noblemen there are skeptical about the rumors. As for the now decommissioned councilors, their words, regardless of their veracity, lack credibility. Although this part was purely speculation from said rumors, it is difficult to determine the authenticity of the matter.

<p id="line_2009">On a side note, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Moss" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s power allowed him to directly eavesdrop on the conversations that he wanted to hear.

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2023">Now that the major problems were resolved, from today onward, I could throw away the worries I had in the past few months and live a peaceful life.</p>
<p id="line_2024">Eh? You’re telling me that not everything was stressful since I was actually enjoying the research?</p>
<p id="line_2025">Well, you’re right. Though I did have to occasionally act as if I was trying my best, lest I be viewed as a slacker. This was what we called adults’ art of socializing. It was never a good idea to invest maximum effort at work. If you were to do that, then the amount of work you did would be viewed as the norm. Naturally, it would seem as if you had no problems with it, and thus you would be prone to be assigned more responsibilities.</p>
<p id="line_2026">A capable man must be able to distinguish how much work was suited for the amount of effort devoted. At the end of the day though, what mattered most was enjoying your work.</p>
<p id="line_2027">—Despite framing it in such flowery language, ultimately, that was just idealism at its finest. After all, I was satisfied with where I was now. Working under these circumstances made me realize again just how fortunate I was.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2028">In any case, I planned to inspect the newly constructed school today. The children I brought from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were studying here too.</p>
<p id="line_2029">I mentioned this once while chatting with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>: letting the children socialize with each other would be the fastest method for them to learn human common sense. In a school filled with only <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> kids, there was a possibility that they would never learn about the norms of human society.</p>
<p id="line_2030">Be that as it may, you wouldn’t have to worry about such things at this school. Many adventurers and migrant laborers, family in tow, had immigrated to our town. Naturally, there were many children among them.</p>
<p id="line_2031">In this world, it was the norm for children of low-income families to be part of the labor force. However, our nation had laws prohibiting child labor. After all, a kid’s job was just to have fun and enjoy their childhood. Anyway, they only needed to study things they were interested in.</p>
<p id="line_2032">Both humans and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be subject to the same standards of education. Surely, they would grow a sense of camaraderie this way. That was the objective.</p>
<p id="line_2033">By the way, the students in this school weren’t limited to just children. Adults would come here to learn writing and mathematics, too. Mastering these subjects was essential, so they were eminently enthusiastic to develop their skills. The lack of these skills would no doubt close many doors for them. They may also make simple mistakes that could trouble their coworkers. Since the adults were all evidently aware of this, they had been studying hard.</p>
<p id="line_2034">Not knowing whether or not anything you learned would be applicable to the real world was probably one of the biggest reasons why people were never motivated to study. However, that wasn’t a problem here. Furthermore, the hard work of the adults would inspire the children to put in similar effort towards their studies.</p>
<p id="line_2035">With that being said, putting aside mathematics, the focus was mainly on reading and writing. To be honest, even I considered the curriculum difficult, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was of the same mind. Being proficient in reading and fluent in conversing was one thing, however—writing was the difficult part.</p>
<p id="line_2036">In my case, I could rely on the automatic translation of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to bypass the issue. Without that, even I didn’t have the confidence to score full marks on a language exam administered here. I figured that as long as it didn’t cause any problems, I could simply play dumb about it. Although, this <em>did</em> feel like cheating.</p>
<p id="line_2037">Getting back on topic, the children were excelling in their studies. Serving as a wonderful incentive to boost their eagerness for learning, I had translated manga into this world’s language. It was a huge success. It seemed like everyone in the school was a fan of the manga, to the point where some even carried it around with them, apparently turning it into a highly coveted status symbol. Kenya, being both adept at combat and a holder of manga, somehow became the boss of the school.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2038">“You stinky boys! Stop playing all the time and help clean the classroom!”</p>
<p id="line_2039"><em>Ah, Alice just lost it.</em></p>
<p id="line_2040">She was shaping up to be an extremely competent class representative.</p>

<p id="line_2045">—Hold on. I guess they <em>were</em> still just kids.</p>
<p id="line_2046">I realized that Alice was the real boss around the class, not Kenya. Were they fighting because of this? Kenya wouldn’t want to admit it, which is perhaps why he wanted to fight Alice.</p>
<p id="line_2047"><em>So, that’s how it is, huh?</em></p>
<p id="line_2048">A boy would intentionally infuriate the girl he liked to make her look his way. However, this tactic wasn’t always effective in reality. Besides, it was liable to mess up and cause the opposite of the intended effect. It was best to treat the girl you admired gently.</p>
<p id="line_2049">Kenya was still too naive and thus presumably lacked this insight. Fighting Alice wouldn’t win her heart; instead, it would doubtlessly serve to only piss her off.</p>
<p id="line_2050">“Didn’t I say this already? I’ll show you how scary I <em>really</em> am!”</p>
<p id="line_2051">Alice was no different, showing not a single shred of femininity. She may have seemed mature, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. But to be fair, Alice <em>was</em> only eleven years old. Didn’t all sixth graders behave this way?</p>
<p id="line_2052">Everyone else’s reaction implied that they were accustomed to this scene.</p>
<p id="line_2053">“Oi, who do you think will win today?”</p>
<p id="line_2054">“Of course it’ll be the Empress.”</p>
<p id="line_2055">“I suppose so. She’s our empress, the youngest and the strongest. While Kenya is strong too, he’s no match for her.”</p>
<p id="line_2056">“It’s because he’s in love with Alice; that’s why he can’t win.”</p>
<p id="line_2057">They were all adding their own two cents.</p>
<p id="line_2058">“Oi, Gail! Don’t talk nonsense!” Kenya complained.</p>
<p id="line_2059">“That’s right! How could Kenya have a crush on me? Is your brain fried or something?” Alice, on the other hand, laughed it off as the ramblings of an idiot.</p>
<p id="line_2060">Gail had very casually revealed Kenya’s secret.</p>
<p id="line_2061"><em>Uhhh—looks like it’s too early for these kids to get in any sort of relationship.</em></p>
<p id="line_2062">That was okay in my book.</p>

Everyone knew that they weren’t really on bad terms despite what appearances suggested.</p>
<p id="line_2064">Gail was the oldest boy and seemed to be covertly monitoring the two, ready to intervene if any real problem were to arise.</p>

<p id="line_2067">“Sensei!” Chloe joyfully exclaimed.</p>
<p id="line_2068">I somehow didn’t sense her aura, which suggested that Chloe’s skills had improved dramatically. Moreover, it looked as if she knew I was coming very early on.</p>
<p id="line_2069">“Ah, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei?! Chloe, that’s cheating and…and cunning!” Alice protested, but wasn’t one to be outdone. Just like Chloe, she came running and hugged me.</p>
<p id="line_2070"><em>Mmmhmm, cuteness is truly the best.</em></p>
<p id="line_2071">Someone emerged from behind them, exclaiming: “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, long time no see arinsu!”</p>
<p id="line_2072">A cute girl with the cliché bob haircut jumped in front of me. She was wearing an elegant kimono and appeared to be a little girl around the same age as Alice. Her most eye-catching features were her fox ears.</p>

<p id="line_2074">Hmm—I didn’t remember seeing a beautiful little girl like this…but I also felt like I’d seen her somewhere before.</p>
<p id="line_2075"><em>Could it be—</em></p>
<p id="line_2076">“Are you Kumara?”</p>
<p id="line_2077">“It is me arinsu!” the young girl with the bob haircut energetically replied—I mean, Kumara replied.</p>
<p id="line_2078">Right, Kumara was a high-level <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. She had successfully evolved, after I had bestowed a name upon her. That must be why she had a human form.</p>
<p id="line_2079">I recalled that I left her in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s care along with the rest of the kids. Once the school was constructed, Kenya and the others began walking to and attending classes. I had always thought that Kumara was staying in the labyrinth all this time. But to my surprise, it seemed that she was going to school with the children as well, and even made some friends. I believed that this was a good thing.</p>
<p id="line_2080">“Eh, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei has come—”</p>
<p id="line_2081">Kenya and Ryota’s reactions were slower than the girls,’ as they only noticed me just now. However, their words were overshadowed by the cheers of the other students.</p>
<p id="line_2082">“W-WOAH—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama!”</p>
<p id="line_2083">“It’s actually him! Awesome!”</p>
<p id="line_2084">“I’m gonna brag about this to my dad later!”</p>
<p id="line_2085">And so, a commotion broke out in the classroom.</p>
<p id="line_2086">Catching wind of the excitement, the teachers that came to investigate soon formed a crowd of their own.</p>
<p id="line_2087">“H-His Majesty himself has graced our facility?! Had you contacted us first, I would’ve shown you around!”</p>
<p id="line_2088">“What silliness is that?!

<p id="line_2090">They were getting riled up as well.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2091">We hired teachers by paying monthly salaries.

<p id="line_2092">The principal of this school was a chief from one of the goblin villages. Even though he couldn’t teach, he was able to promptly handle any conflicts that broke out.

<p id="line_2093">Other than the principal, the rest of the staff were all humans.

<p id="line_2094">Everything was going very smoothly.</p>
<p id="line_2095">At first, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s all seemed rather confused, but they didn’t treat the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> any differently.

<p class="space-break" id="line_2096">“Ahh, don’t worry, I just snuck out on my own today. I actually have something to discuss with Kenya and the kids.”</p>
<p id="line_2097">“I see, then please visit and observe the children’s progress next time!”</p>
<p id="line_2098">“Indeed, if you inform us of your arrival, we shall present you with the perfect learning conditions!”</p>
<p id="line_2099">The teachers and children simultaneously nodded in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_2100">But hold on a second… What the hell did ‘perfect learning conditions’ mean? <em>Wouldn’t you guys be guilty of trying to deceive me?</em> Didn’t that make the whole visit meaningless to begin with?</p>

<p id="line_2106">This guy seemed to be someone that wasn’t mindful of social statuses, yet he was still cognizant of the fact that he couldn’t directly address me by my name.

<p id="line_2107">“You have a point. You’ll need to wait until you’re out of the public eye in order to relax honorifics. It’s a bit inconvenient here.”</p>

<p id="line_2109">You shouldn’t be happy seeing a man wink at you, but it felt like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Fritz" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was somehow naturally affectionate.</p>

<p id="line_2117">The teachers had the same reaction; I wasn’t sure whether to laugh at this or not.

<p id="line_2134">It was best to pretend that I didn’t hear that last part.</p>
<p id="line_2135">“The reason why I invited you today was to show you the progress of the children’s growth. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono and I both have been instructing them, so I wanted to update you on their current situation.”</p>

<p id="line_2139">She had the dark aura of a sadist around her.</p>
<p id="line_2140">“I get it. Then I’ll use my ‘Clones’ as their opponents,” I suggested, splitting my slime body from my main body. The slime looked like a knock-off version of me, but it had the actual me inside. My humanoid body on the other hand would be handling the battle trial.</p>

<p id="line_2143">The bellicose couple Kenya and Alice rejoiced at this news immediately.</p>
<p id="line_2144">The normally reserved Gail started to warm up to the proposal as well. Ryota resembled his usual fussy self, though his eyes were glittering with light that conveyed his anticipation. Since he hadn’t called quits yet, it meant that he had acquired a level of confidence already.</p>
<p id="line_2145">Now the other two, Kumara and Chloe.</p>
<p id="line_2146">“Then I shall go first arinsu!”</p>
<p id="line_2147">“Ehh?

<p id="line_2150">Hearing this, everyone gave a smile. They seemed to be looking forward to dueling with me. It wasn’t a bad idea taking them on occasionally.</p>
<p id="line_2151">With this naive thought, I began to battle the kids in a simulated arena.</p>
<p id="line_2152">………</p>

<p id="line_2154">…</p>
<p id="line_2155">—One hour later—</p>
<p id="line_2156">“Y-you guys, haven’t you gotten a little too strong?!” My voice echoed throughout the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_2157">Kenya had indeed become more powerful than the average <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He synergized beautifully with the light spirit. Using bizarre stances that you would only see in manga, he brought out these phantasmagoric sword techniques.</p>
<p id="line_2158">Ryota’s swordsmanship was not as strong as Kenya’s; despite that, he could use both water and wind ‘Spirit Magic’ strategically.</p>
<p id="line_2159">Gail, conversely, was well balanced. His cautious personality made him focus more on defense, and he utilized his shield and sword cleverly. He also incorporated earth elemental ‘Spirit Magic’ to make his defense almost indestructible.</p>
<p id="line_2160">While the boys surprised me, the girls were even more impressive.</p>
<p id="line_2161">First, Alice. No wonder people called her Empress. She pulled out a number of dolls from thin air, which were made of magisteel like Beretta. They snarled at me as if they were alive. Her puppeteering skill was getting stronger, and this time, the puppets were no play dolls. If she had faced anyone else, it could have been dangerous.</p>
<p id="line_2162">Moreover, Alice had one more card up her sleeve. There was a massive number of swords floating in midair that targeted me constantly throughout the battle. <em>Scary.</em> There was no pattern to their trajectories. If I didn’t have ‘Predict Future Attack,’ I probably would have taken a couple of hits. In a few years’ time, she may be able to rival a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> commander.</p>
<p id="line_2163">Let’s not forget about Kumara.</p>
<p id="line_2164">“Come out everyone, demonstrate your power before <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama arinsu!” she shouted while unleashing her power.</p>
<p id="line_2165">Her nine tails began glowing golden and twisted behind the cute girl. The next instant, her tails turned into beasts.</p>
<p id="line_2166">Eh, I should have seen this coming, but the creatures that flew out startled me, nonetheless. As expected from Clayman’s ace in the hole. She was already tremendously tough with the beasts summoned from her two tails—and there were eight of them this time. Her ninth tail seemed to be her own, while the rest were all magical beasts. Each creature was over rank A. An average <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, in all likelihood, wouldn’t even be able to touch one of them. They could also share their combat experience, making their coordination flawless.</p>
<p id="line_2167">Based on what I saw, she had the potential to beat <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Fritz" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others. This little girl was on par with the ‘Ten Great Saints.’ I know it may sound like I was joking, but I was telling the truth. Once the beasts from her tails gained more combat experience, she would definitely become an unbelievable force. She may eventually live up to the name of the ninetieth-floor guardian.</p>
<p id="line_2168">The last one was Chloe.</p>
<p id="line_2169">“Hiiyaaaa!”</p>
<p id="line_2170">Her yell was very cute, whereas her sword was not, even in the slightest. She was faster than Kenya. In fact, much more than that. I battled against six people in total this time; however, Chloe was the only person that I fought seriously.</p>
<p id="line_2171">Actually, I was treating the situation too lightly. Chloe was so strong that had I not fought her earnestly, I honestly would have been in danger. Obviously, I wouldn’t have died even if I had gone easy on her, but it was definitely humiliating if I lost in front of the kids.</p>
<p id="line_2172">I really didn’t want to embarrass myself here. That was why I had to fight seriously—please don’t call me childish. I would never hold back to preserve the little dignity I still had.</p>
<p id="line_2173">“I can understand your feelings.”</p>
<p id="line_2174">“Indeed, I was just like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. I needed to show everything I had battling against lil’ Chloe.”</p>
<p id="line_2175">Seriously…? Even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who were both more skillful in swordsmanship than me, had trouble fighting Chloe?</p>
<p id="line_2176">I was genuinely shocked. Knowing the innocent Chloe was so powerful made me shiver.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2177">“Ahh, you guys are so good!”</p>
<p id="line_2178">“Right? Hearing sensei say this fills me with confidence!”</p>
<p id="line_2179">“But Chloe-chan was the really strong one. Even though everyone calls me the Empress, I’ve never won against her.”</p>
<p id="line_2180">“Yeah, Chloe is so different. She looks so gentle at first glance, but she’s super scary when angry. An angry Alice isn’t scary at all, but when Chloe gets angry, we have to pray.”</p>
<p id="line_2181">Alice jumped up, furious, and shouted, “What did you just say?!”</p>
<p id="line_2182">Ryota and Gail simply nodded in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_2183">It looked like the boys were all on the same page.</p>
<p id="line_2184">“Kenya was quite strong as well,” I remarked. “Although, your stance and swordsmanship could use some work, consider them your weak points. If you can refine those, you will move even more fluidly.”</p>
<p id="line_2185">His moves felt like they were inspired by manga. Although they looked wonderfully dashing, it was detached from traditional swordsmanship, and he made many unnecessary moves. If he could fix this, Kenya would become stronger too.</p>
<p id="line_2186">“That’s precisely it. No matter how I teach him, Kenya just won’t budge…” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sighed, baffled.</p>
<p id="line_2187">She had noticed it as well.</p>
<p id="line_2188">“I can’t help it either! That pose was taught by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san himself!”</p>
<p id="line_2189"><em>Huh?</em></p>
<p id="line_2190"><em>Did that idiot <b>have</b> to teach Kenya such superfluous sword techniques?</em></p>
<p id="line_2191">I mean, it did look pretty cool in hindsight, so it wasn’t <em>entirely</em> useless…but knowing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s actual skill, it suddenly made me think that such a stance was completely trivial.</p>
<p id="line_2192">No wonder the stance looked like it came from manga—it clearly was.</p>
<p id="line_2193">“All right then,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> interjected, “there’s no use talking. I shall instruct you personally to remove your bad habits. I’ll train you well and make your movement as smooth as flowing water.”</p>
<p id="line_2194"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s method was different from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s in the sense that he wasn’t entirely faithful to traditional swordsmanship. It seemed that he was keeping some of his more heretical techniques to himself, which was why if he found some skill useful yet non-traditional, he would focus on refining those techniques in secret.</p>
<p id="line_2195">Thankfully, it appeared what Kenya learned was not entirely wasted. I left the rest to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2196">As opposed to that—</p>
<p id="line_2197">“Chloe’s swordsmanship was quite similar to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s. Your moves were very beautiful and effective.”</p>
<p id="line_2198">Chole smiled happily at my praise.</p>
<p id="line_2199">“Yeah! It looked just like Shizu-sensei’s, that’s why I have been working hard to imitate it!”</p>
<p id="line_2200">“Even though you call it imitation, it’s not that simple to learn. It may be a different case if you learn by using Skills like I do, but you’ve mastered this entirely through your talent and hard work. You should feel proud!”</p>
<p id="line_2201">“Indeed. I have had all sorts of disciples in the past, yet I’ve never seen anyone rivaling the talent of this young girl. Your future is very promising.”</p>
<p id="line_2202"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were both rigorous teachers, yet they were both praising Chloe.</p>
<p id="line_2203">It sounded like she was extraordinarily talented. Considering how young she was, there was no telling how much she would progress if training continued. On one hand, I was looking forward to it, but on the other hand, I couldn’t help but feel a tinge of fear.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2204">All right, back to the focus of today.</p>
<p id="line_2205"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to have other goals during her visit here.</p>
<p id="line_2206">“The reason why I called you here, for one, is that I wanted to show you the progress the children have made. These children are all very adept, but they are still young. In order to prevent them from straying off the right path, I hope you will get to know about their current states.”</p>
<p id="line_2207">It went without saying that I had been keeping an eye on the matter as well. Nevertheless, I decided to heed her advice. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was treating these children, who were previously tended to by Shizu-san, as her siblings.</p>
<p id="line_2208">“I understand. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> will take care of them too, plus there are a lot of seniors who can help them in this town as well. I will do the same so that they won’t go down the wrong paths in life.”</p>
<p id="line_2209">“Hehe, I knew you’d say so. I brought up what I said just in case.”</p>
<p id="line_2210"><em>This gal really worries too much.</em></p>
<p id="line_2211"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> really did have a gentle side despite her usual, frigid demeanor.</p>
<p id="line_2212">“Well then, what were your other reasons?” I asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> while peeking at the children who were in a group fight against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2213">“Well actually, the main reason why—”</p>
<p id="line_2214"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> paused upon saying so and turned her eyes to the children.</p>
<p id="line_2215">Even though this was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, taking on all five of the children at once was still tricky. Although he could see through the children’s intentions, if he had reacted just a tad bit slower, he would have sustained a fatal injury.</p>
<p id="line_2216">If just considering their constitutions, the children completely outmatched <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Naturally, he could not be careless.</p>
<p id="line_2217">By the way, Kumara did not participate. Had she joined and fought seriously, they would have won against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with sheer numbers. Nonetheless, the team had Chloe right now, so the children had the upper hand. I thought they had wonderful team composition. It was as if they were putting on a martial arts performance. It honestly was captivating.</p>
<p id="line_2218">“She’s so young yet so strong,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> muttered, her eyes fixed on Chloe.</p>
<p id="line_2219">While Kenya, Ryota, Gail and Alice were also very strong, Chloe was abnormally powerful. If she were absent, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could have ended the battle already rather than being in knee deep mud right now.</p>
<p id="line_2220">And soon, the simulated battle ended.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2221">The children were all catching up with their breaths as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began doling out advice. It was no wonder why the children had all grown so fast if the training was this harsh every time.</p>
<p id="line_2222"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> returned her attention to me and got back on topic.</p>
<p id="line_2223">“I got mesmerized by their fight halfway through our conversation. Have you scheduled the music exchange that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama has been pestering for yet? I knew she’d be interested, but by the look of things, she seemed to really enjoy it. That’s why I came to bring the matter to you.”</p>
<p id="line_2224">How surprising—but I had been swamped with work, so I was planning to postpone it.</p>
<p id="line_2225">“Oh, I guess <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> genuinely liked our concert. I told <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Takt" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the band to continue to practice, and as a result, the number of pieces they can perform has also increased.”</p>
<p id="line_2226">“Your memory in that area is really amazing. I can’t even read music notes, and writing scores from memory was obviously impossible.”</p>
<p id="line_2227">Ahh, so there <em>were</em> things that even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wasn’t good at. She hadn’t been all that interested in the concert either; she was probably terrible with music.</p>
<p id="line_2228">I enjoyed a momentary internal feeling of superiority. With that being said, I had to rely on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san too.</p>
<p id="line_2229">“Then, please anticipate our visit soon.”</p>
<p id="line_2230">“Very well. Moving a whole band <em>is</em> a huge project, so allow us to send our <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s as escorts. We will use Elemental Magic ‘Warp Portal’ to send them in groups.”</p>
<p id="line_2231">“Wonderful. Since there’s going to be a lot of luggage with so many people, I figured that going there by horse-drawn carriages would be a hassle.”</p>
<p id="line_2232">I recalled that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was protected by a ‘Barrier,’ meaning we couldn’t just teleport there. This was why we needed a more comfortable method of transportation.</p>
<p id="line_2233">The problem would be resolved when the train was complete. But that would be a long time away from now. You couldn’t ask for things that didn’t exist yet.</p>
<p id="line_2234">Transporting the whole band wasn’t only about moving the performers themselves. Each player had to carry their own instrument for the performance, which was quite cumbersome. If we were to travel by horse-drawn carriages, we might be forced to go down some unfinished roads as well. Riding on roads that were in poor condition could damage the instruments, and we wanted to avoid that type of situation.</p>
<p id="line_2235">I was super envious of the dragon ship owned by the empress of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Traveling by train might be fun, but in order to reduce the travel time, aircraft were obviously more convenient in that regard.</p>
<p id="line_2236">You could navigate by sea or land for logistical transportation, but for sightseeing or other purposes, air was the fastest and comfiest method.</p>
<p id="line_2237">This was the reason why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s proposal was very beneficial to us. I promised that I would help too, and so we worked out the detailed matters regarding the travel plans.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2238">As I was halfway through my discussion with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the children, who were on break, gathered together.</p>

<p id="line_2240">Since Chloe had inquired, I explained the music exchange that would be held at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to everyone.</p>
<p id="line_2241">“I want to go too!”</p>
<p id="line_2242">“Me too!”</p>
<p id="line_2243">“I might fall asleep during it, but since Chloe and Alice are going, I’ll go too!”</p>
<p id="line_2244">“Yeah me too!”</p>
<p id="line_2245">“In that case, I’m going as well. The fact that these guys are coming and the possibility of them causing problems is what worries me.”</p>
<p id="line_2246">Because of Chloe’s words, Kenya and the others began clamoring about wanting to go to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2247"><em>Uhh—what should I do?</em></p>
<p id="line_2248">It was good to let them see more of the world as a form of social experience. But if you were to ask me whether there might be danger or not, I couldn’t confidently rule that out.</p>
<p id="line_2249">Raising her head to look at my troubled expression, Kumara opened her mouth and timidly said, “I-I wish to go too arinsu…”</p>
<p id="line_2250">Kumara’s presence was needed as the guardian of the ninetieth floor. The way she spoke indicated her regret; it appeared that her senses were telling her not to beseech such a request from me. But as a child, she naturally yearned to go on a trip with her friends. It went against my way of doing things if I were to turn her down.</p>
<p id="line_2251">“You don’t have to be so courteous. If it’s only a tiny, selfish request, ask and I may just approve it.”</p>
<p id="line_2252">It was gonna be a headache if she were to grow up to become as stubborn as Milim, but that was better than losing her innocence as a child. Based on these considerations, I told her my thoughts while patting Kumara’s head.</p>
<p id="line_2253"><em>Similar to her small fox form, it feels smooth and fluffy.

<p id="line_2255">“Awesome! Now we can officially travel and skip school!”</p>
<p id="line_2256">“But you always looked happy at school, Ken-chan, did you really want to skip classes?”</p>
<p id="line_2257">“Idiot! Attending classes is fun, but if we get to play while everyone else has to study—how should I say this—it makes us really special.”</p>
<p id="line_2258">“Kenya, I understand what you mean, but I don’t want to get corrupted by your mindset. On the other hand, I feel very excited too.”</p>
<p id="line_2259">“Right? That’s exactly it!”</p>
<p id="line_2260">The children were all fired up about going before I had even given them permission. They even went on to declare something about skipping school. It wasn’t like I didn’t understand their feelings. And although I could sympathize, I would never put such a thought into action…</p>
<p id="line_2261">“Right, it won’t matter. Instead, please have the teachers assign them more homework.”</p>
<p id="line_2262">“Eh! How can you do this, sensei!”</p>
<p id="line_2263">I ignored Kenya’s cries.</p>
<p id="line_2264">Everything doesn’t always go your way, and many things in life were ultimately unfair. I intended for them to learn about this point while they were still young. This was a demonstration of my fatherly love, and they would surely grow stronger from the experience.</p>
<p id="line_2265">This was definitely not me picking on or punishing them. Hopefully, the children would come to understand my justification behind it.</p>
<p id="line_2266">“I just want to be with sensei.”</p>
<p id="line_2267">Chloe, who started the whole thing, seemed rather satisfied.</p>
<p id="line_2268"><em>All right, I suppose it’s fine as long as they make some good memories together.</em></p>
<p id="line_2269">“Your heart goes soft so easily.”</p>

But she didn’t appear to object.</p>
<p id="line_2272"><em>Then we are all good to go.</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2273">And so, the plan was settled.</p>
<p id="line_2274">We would be attending the music exchange in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_2276">On our tour through the city’s streets the children were overcome with curiosity as they took in all the sights with wonder. On the contrary, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Takt" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the band members were practically shaking in their boots.</p>

Since I had let her guard our town last time, I decided to bring her. Instead, Veldora would be keeping guard.</p>
<p id="line_2278"><em>You have an important task as the master of the labyrinth</em>—I convinced him with this line. That was why he didn’t follow us during this expedition. It might have been a different case if we were heading to another country, but it was simply too dangerous to let Veldora meet with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2279">«Warning. Probability of problem occurring—100 percent.»</p>
<p id="line_2280">I also received such advice from you-know-who.</p>
<p id="line_2281">It was an obvious landmine to avoid—one that <b>must</b> be avoided—at all costs.</p>
<p id="line_2282">Our guide was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> herself.</p>
<p id="line_2283">“Welcome to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. His Majesty the Pope welcomes you all too,” she introduced in a tone that sounded remarkably disrespectful towards the pope. Although I was aware of the secret that the pope was merely a role Louis played, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Takt" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others knew nothing of it. This was, of course, highly classified information. Obviously, I couldn’t tell the children, nor could we tell the members of the band.</p>
<p id="line_2284">I gave an improvised response and confirmed our later schedule with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2285">“First off,” she announced, “tonight, we will be hosting a banquet to welcome everyone. Tomorrow, we will invite you all to complete soundchecks. The following day is scheduled for rehearsal and the concert will take place in three days’ time.”</p>
<p id="line_2286">“What do you think, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Takt" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_2287">“Y-yes sir! There’s no problem, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. Even though we require magic to transfer the instruments, I don’t think it will affect them very much. We will need to make slight adjustments depending on the size of the venue, but since there are bands here as well, I don’t think there will be a problem.”</p>
<p id="line_2288">Then it was okay to perform.</p>
<p id="line_2289">“You only have one day to rehearse though.”</p>
<p id="line_2290">“Hahaha, that is indeed true. However, we’ve been practicing every day back home for this concert. All of the members can guarantee that we will not disappoint.”</p>
<p id="line_2291">Excellent!</p>
<p id="line_2292">It must be thanks to their diligence that they possessed such conviction. Despite the fact that hard work was sometimes unable to measure up to natural talent, it was still a reliable method. With hard work, you could build up confidence that subsequently made your heart stronger. Plus, this newfound resilience would also prove itself useful in all manner of other everyday activities. If you persevered every day, you would obviously be confident in your work.</p>
<p id="line_2293">I gave full marks to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Takt" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s answer.</p>
<p id="line_2294"><em>Now, I am very much looking forward to the concert</em>—I thought to myself, nodding with satisfaction.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2295">Fast forward to later that night.</p>
<p id="line_2296">The members of the band were being treated like nobility. But this only made them more confused and nervous.</p>
<p id="line_2297">“M-may I ask, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama? We are mere common citizens of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Are we really allowed to stay in such luxurious rooms?”</p>
<p id="line_2298">This great expedition involved more than one hundred participants, yet each person was assigned their own room. They also got a personal maid, who was on standby next door, to respond the moment they were called.</p>
<p id="line_2299">Moreover, there was a bar that even rivalled ones in a five-star hotel. You could access it regardless of species, human or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. This, nonetheless, made everyone rather nervous.</p>
<p id="line_2300">The banquet was excessively grand as well. They continuously served bite-sized appetizers, which were both delicious and arranged to be aesthetically pleasing. While portion sizes weren’t too large, the flavors more than made up for that deficiency. Furthermore, the dishes were extraordinarily creative in order to satisfy everyone’s varying palates.</p>
<p id="line_2301">In the beginning, the children were complaining about the small portions and appeared unsatisfied. But, by the end of the banquet, they all seemed quite full as they patted their round bellies.</p>
<p id="line_2302">Since I was a slime, it was impossible for me to be “full” by any measure. The children’s stomachs, on the other hand, had their limits. Regardless of how small the portion of each serving was, if they ate a bunch, then naturally it would eventually add up until they couldn’t eat another bite.</p>
<p id="line_2303">In contrast to the innocent kids, the band members’ feelings were a lot more complicated.</p>
<p id="line_2304">There were many delicious cuisines in Tempest as well, but none of them were like this—made with extreme attentiveness and served exclusively to nobles and royalty.</p>
<p id="line_2305">Not only had they never tasted such luxurious dishes, they also received accommodating services that they had never experienced before. It was unreasonable to expect them to not feel skittish.</p>
<p id="line_2306">“In any case, don’t be so constrained. This is all a token of appreciation from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> for your performance later.”</p>
<p id="line_2307">I was tremendously grateful that I didn’t have to perform.</p>
<p id="line_2308">I hadn’t shown dedication like they had, yet even if I did and was in the same position as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Takt" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the band members, the crushing performance anxiety would’ve been enough to drown out my enjoyment of the dishes. Not being able to savor delicious food was a huge loss in the pleasures of life.</p>
<p id="line_2309">That was the main reason why I hoped <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Takt" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the band members would appreciate it as much as they could.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2310">The banquet soon ended without a hitch, and the band members made their way back to their rooms.</p>
<p id="line_2311">The children went to sleep too. They were quite excited after spending the entire day seeing new and interesting things. They were undoubtedly exhausted after all the fun they had.</p>
<p id="line_2312">Everyone quickly fell asleep, leaving me the only one awake. I was planning to use my special skill of sleepy boi, but apparently it wouldn’t be necessary.</p>
<p id="line_2313"><em>Knock, knock</em>—I heard the door being gently rapped on.</p>
<p id="line_2314">“My apologies for disturbing Your Majesty at this hour, but our master would like to invite Your Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to join her. Is it convenient for you to convene?”</p>
<p id="line_2315">Someone ran up to me almost silently. It was one of the attendants that served <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—a ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Surmounter" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ Unlike the ones who came to our research facility, the attendants appeared to be very outstanding individuals. Although I was under the impression that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would not show herself this time, the attendant’s presence suggested that she intended to meet me.</p>
<p id="line_2316">I accepted the invitation without hesitation.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2317">I only brought <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> along, and we had the maid guide us to the venue.</p>
<p id="line_2318">“Long time no see, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I see you did not bring that evil dragon with you, that’s commendable.”</p>
<p id="line_2319">I figured that “evil dragon” was referring to Veldora. Considering all the bad stuff that guy caused in the past, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> definitely had a right to call him that, but I thought she was being a little too harsh.</p>
<p id="line_2320">Nevertheless, it was none of my business.</p>
<p id="line_2321">“Indeed, it’s been a long time. Obviously, I wouldn’t bring him along. That guy’s a walking troublemaker. Letting him come to an event such as this would only give me a headache.”</p>
<p id="line_2322">“Kukuku, so you do understand.”</p>
<p id="line_2323">With just a short exchange, I suddenly got the feeling that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I had a lot in common.</p>
<p id="line_2324">It turned out Veldora <em>could</em> be useful on occasion.</p>
<p id="line_2325">Three people, including <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, were waiting for me in this opulent room. Gunther, with the appearance of an old butler, stood to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s left while Louis the Pope stood to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s right. Since Roy, who was acting as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s body double, had died, all that remained of the ‘Three Archdukes’ were gathered here.</p>
<p id="line_2326">I was somewhat perplexed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s absence on this occasion.</p>
<p id="line_2327">“Aren’t you going to call <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_2328">To my question, Gunter and Louis helpfully replied.</p>
<p id="line_2329">“I was planning to. Even though she’s evolved from a sage to a ‘saint,’ she was still human once. While she doesn’t need to sleep anymore, she apparently could not get rid of her old habit as a human.”</p>
<p id="line_2330">“I went to call her, but she mentioned something about how insufficient sleep would be bad for skin and some other bizarre things…”</p>
<p id="line_2331">Indeed, it was already past midnight, which explained why they didn’t drag <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> along.</p>
<p id="line_2332">As I was going to take their word for it, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> cracked a small smile and told me something unexpected.</p>
<p id="line_2333">“Ara, her bodily structure has evolved close to that of a spiritual life-form, so there’s no way her skin could get worse. But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> does require sleep. Even though she’s a ‘saint’ now, her body is still the same as when she was human. It will take a long time before her body fully evolves as well. This has been a misunderstanding, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is not some superwoman,” she smiled again upon finishing her explanation.</p>
<p id="line_2334">Humans were different from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the sense that their bodies would not change drastically like the latter’s—that was the gist of her description. In other words, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> still retained all of her human qualities, and in a way, that could be considered her Achilles’ Heel.</p>
<p id="line_2335">I noticed the way <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> evolved was quite beyond common sense too.</p>
<p id="line_2336">Incidentally, this went without saying, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t need any sleep either. And while <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> still required some rest, she only needed three hours each time. She could also go without sleep for more than seven days straight. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were the same, which was perhaps a sign that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had stronger adaptability to different environments.</p>
<p id="line_2337">If <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wasn’t here, I just had to accept it.

<p id="line_2338">“In that case, I have a gift for you guys.

<p id="line_2343">Putting that aside for now, I asked, “Right, so why did you call me here?”</p>
<p id="line_2344">“Umm, I was deliberating over whether I should tell you this or not, but now I’ve decided to share this information with you. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has been planning something sinister.

<p id="line_2345">She cut to the chase without skipping a beat.</p>

<p id="line_2349">Well, to be honest, I felt awfully conflicted.</p>
<p id="line_2350">It might be a different case had this land been under my administration, but this was another person’s entire nation.

<p id="line_2356">I could see glimpses of her confidence from what she had said. The city was an iron fortress even against an entire army. That was to be expected of a city built to withstand attacks from Veldora. A ten thousand strong army, in all likelihood, wouldn’t be enough to conquer it.</p>

<p id="line_2359">“You are correct,” added Louis. “They’ve been operating behind the scenes on this land for a long time. Surely, he had prepared one or two secret passages. Humans are exceptionally skillful at such trickeries.”</p>
<p id="line_2360">“The most unfortunate thing is that man used to be the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of ‘Light,’ and even fought against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama in the past,” continued Gunther. “If he were to hide his aura, we wouldn’t be able to detect him.”</p>
<p id="line_2361">Their eyes glimmered as they spoke.</p>
<p id="line_2362">This sounded like a challenging task to handle.

<p id="line_2366">Just when I was thinking he had been behaving nicely, he abruptly interrupted with this line. Seriously, couldn’t he be more mindful of the time and place?</p>
<p id="line_2367">Louis and Gunther’s expressions darkened drastically, but fortunately, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s laughter made the two hold back.</p>

Yet, if this evolution required some time to activate before coming into effect, then a newly risen ‘saint’ would not pose too much of a threat.

<p id="line_2448">This was not to say, however, that they didn’t have their merits. Although the citizens lacked freedom, it was a blissful society because the people here didn’t compete with each other. The only work they needed to do was to follow the procedures already set for them by their superiors.</p>
<p id="line_2449">In a sense, everyone had essentially relinquished their independence, but in return, they would never experience hunger or pain. Those who couldn’t bear such a society had already left the country, whereas the remaining people had all adhered to these rules since birth. Naturally, this would seem unbalanced to a bystander.</p>
<p id="line_2450">Ignorance is bliss.</p>
<p id="line_2451">People wouldn’t be dismayed if they never knew how less fortunate they were compared to others. Conversely, this discontentment could also inspire people to work harder for greater aspirations. After all, a society without competition would become stagnant.</p>
<p id="line_2452">“For some reason this feels really boring,” Alice muttered to herself.</p>
<p id="line_2453">“Yeah” Kenya voiced his agreement. “People our age here are all working. Aren’t there any schools?”</p>

<p id="line_2456">But I had to wonder, did she really think that was the right thing to do? Did they have no qualms about the fact that the upper echelons of society had monopolized all luxuries for themselves?</p>
<p id="line_2457">But on the contrary, she still had a point. It didn’t feel right to teach the unknowing commoners about luxury when they didn’t need to know anything about it in the first place…</p>
<p id="line_2458">“No matter how hard one tries, there will always be some things that are impossible to acquire. If people never know about the existence of these things, then they won’t feel the need to obtain it and suffer as a result.”</p>
<p id="line_2459">“That’s true as well…”</p>
<p id="line_2460">Kenya wasn’t dumb either. He understood what I meant.</p>
<p id="line_2461">“Living in an extremely regulated society like this, we maintain a high standard of happiness for our citizens.

<p id="line_2462">That made sense.</p>
<p id="line_2463">If their people were ignorant of things like luxury, then they wouldn’t be allowed to have contact with other nations in fear of them learning about the inequality they were living in.</p>
<p id="line_2464">“They sound like fish raised in a fishbowl.”</p>
<p id="line_2465">“If they feel like they are happy, then we should not interfere.”</p>
<p id="line_2466">“I suppose so. Human happiness cannot be satisfied by materialistic desires alone. A society that pursues spiritual happiness definitely isn’t a bad idea either.”</p>
<p id="line_2467">Although, I probably wouldn’t be able to tolerate it. I believed that my knowledge of these luxuries granted me the right to pursue that prosperity.</p>
<p id="line_2468">A long, long time ago, I used to run around the neighborhood playing hide and seek with friends. Perhaps if it were me from back then, I would have found this society to be very comfortable.</p>
<p id="line_2469"><em>Everyone has a different definition of happiness. You don’t have the right to criticize others and call their ideologies false. Think for yourself and do things your own way.</em></p>
<p id="line_2470">I thought that should be sufficient. Even so, there was something else that I was mindful of—</p>
<p id="line_2471">“—But the people here won’t be able to survive on their own. If they are to sustain a life like this, they need protection—”</p>
<p id="line_2472">—Chloe’s mutter was just what I was thinking.</p>
<p id="line_2473"><em>Children’s observation skills can’t be underestimated sometimes.</em></p>

<p id="line_2475"><em>Looks like she noticed it too.</em></p>
<p id="line_2476">This society was twisted, in a sense. Without its ruler, its citizens, unknowledgeable of the outside world, were unable to do anything. Losing their personal freedom meant that their lives were entirely in other people’s hands. A life like that would be no different from livestock…</p>
<p id="line_2477">“—Indeed. But we have been working hard to improve the situation to prevent such things from happening.”</p>
<p id="line_2478">“Oh—I see. But I still think it’s better if everyone can work together. Then they won’t just rely on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-oneechan’s hard work. Everyone can help out!”</p>
<p id="line_2479">That was an idealistic take because things were not as simple as “working hard.”</p>
<p id="line_2480">Everyone was born with different talents, and so the amount of responsibilities they could accomplish were unequal as well. The word “equality” sounded wonderful, but everyone would still come to experience cruel and unjust reality.</p>
<p id="line_2481">Idealism and realism.</p>
<p id="line_2482">The two locked in eternal conflict with each other. When one of them stands valid, the other will not. So there was never really a right answer. As long as you walk down the path you believe in, that was enough. The unknown was what made life so interesting.</p>
<p id="line_2483">The children appeared to be troubled over something the rest of the day. It made me realize again that happiness wasn’t just about fulfilling our material needs. Even though I knew this, I couldn’t stop emphasizing it. Regardless of the conclusion, I didn’t think the day was wasted.</p>
<p id="line_2484">I suppose that the Holy Empire of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s approach was another valid method. This diversity allowed for life to have infinite possibilities.</p>
<p id="line_2485">I reflected upon my life again and pondered carefully. I figured not limiting myself intentionally was the correct path for me. I was reincarnated as a slime after being stabbed to death in my previous life. There was no telling what would happen in the future. And if that were the case, not living in the moment would be a shame.</p>
<p id="line_2486">I couldn’t help but ponder after considering all these thoughts.</p>
<p id="line_2487">And thus the wheels of fate began to turn…</p>

Since she had yet to obtain a physical body, she had a limited range of activity. Consequently, Leon could not leave this land. She was simply too dangerous to be left alone.

There’s no way we can coexist with her. Any attempts at negotiation were ignored as well.

<p id="line_2494">“Yes, Claude. I couldn’t believe it either, that’s why I came to verify.

<p id="line_2495">“Is that even possible…?”</p>
<p id="line_2496">Hearing the words of Leon’s top knight—Black Knight Claude, the strongest knight of the Golden Valley of El Dorado—Silver Knight Alrose responded with agitation.</p>
<p id="line_2497">Not only Leon, but all of this land’s inhabitants were troubled by these <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

It was so unbelievable that they were all in shock.</p>
<p id="line_2498">Moreover, even the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gate of Hell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ had disappeared. They couldn’t help but suspect that this was a prelude to something much more ominous. The ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gate of Hell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ was the door where the physical world and spiritual world overlapped.

<p id="line_2499">In the past, Leon had sent out his knight order several times to try and seal the gate, yet their efforts were foiled by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on every occasion. There had been regular skirmishes ever since he founded his nation here.</p>
<p id="line_2500">The most frustrating part was that Leon was unable to destroy the source of their problems, thus enabling spiritual life-forms to revive endlessly.

<p id="line_2501">For Leon, the ruler of this rich land, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were the root cause of his worries.

<p id="line_2521">“—Uh!”</p>
<p id="line_2522">“Who could have…?”</p>
<p id="line_2523"><em>Based on the current situation in the Western Nations, who is the most likely suspect?</em>—Leon pondered silently to himself.</p>
<p id="line_2524">The answer seemed both obvious and obscure.</p>
<p id="line_2525">“—The secret organization ‘Cerberus’?”</p>
<p id="line_2526">The only people who knew Leon was collecting otherworlder children were those suspicious merchants. Actually, there were others, those being the people who originally provided the merchandise with summoning magic.</p>
<p id="line_2527"><em>Could it be that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s discovered the secret behind their summonings? Or perhaps they had secretly allied with the merchants…</em></p>
<p id="line_2528">Once doubt took hold, it started to rapidly grow. However, based on the new information, it just didn’t make any sense. If the situation simply involved five mere kids, then there was no reason for Leon to act—or at least, that should be how anyone involved in the matter should view it…</p>
<p id="line_2529">For a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you normally avoided interfering with the affairs of your peers. Moreover, imposing yourself on the affairs of other <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s when it didn’t involve you in the first place would be an extraordinarily foolish act. If you did not tread carefully, you might end up antagonizing two <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s at once. That was the reason why the smarter choice for Leon was to ignore this information. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> might have been up to something, but it was in all likelihood directed towards <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and therefore of no consequence to Leon.</p>
<p id="line_2530"><em>There is no reason for me to act</em>—Leon finally concluded.</p>
<p id="line_2531">Yet this time, it was difficult for him to justify his decision. Likely realizing the validity of what Leon said, his subordinates began expressing their opinions too.</p>
<p id="line_2532">“I see…so someone is trying to take advantage of Leon-sama, no?”</p>
<p id="line_2533">“Shall we eliminate them?”</p>
<p id="line_2534">Leon spoke up to stop them. “No, without concrete evidence, it’s not wise to make a move against ‘Cerberus,’ since they enjoy quite the standing with the Eastern Empire.

Furthermore—”</p>
<p id="line_2535">Leon calmly made his decision and gave his instructions when a sense of unease crossed his mind.</p>
<p id="line_2536">He recalled the name Kroba Hale.</p>
<p id="line_2537"><em>Could it be…</em></p>
<p id="line_2538">Yes, there was no reason for him to act, and moving now would be the same as stepping into someone’s trap. Despite knowing this, Leon was still extremely anxious.</p>

<p id="line_2541">Yet today—</p>
<p id="line_2542"><em>This is unbelievable, but for some reason, I feel like I must act this time…</em></p>
<p id="line_2543">Leon had stopped in the middle of his sentence as his subordinates watched on. Alrose and Claude spoke up.</p>

<p id="line_2549">The next time he opened his eyes, a firm smile had emerged on his face.</p>

She sank deeply into a luxurious chair, beautiful like a scene straight out of a painting. She was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="high elf" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the gorgeous Emperor of the Sorcerer’s Dynasty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—Elmesia <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="El-Ru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2798">The two of them sat facing each other under the gazebo set in a breathtaking garden. A faint trail of steam drifted from the teacup that had just been served, and its rich fragrance was relaxing. Maids waited by the side to refill the tea before it got cold. The two silently observed each other for a while.</p>
<p id="line_2799">Elmesia spoke first. “As always, you are a man of few words, Leon-kun. It’s been so long since you visited me; it’s gonna be quite boring if you continue being like that.”</p>
<p id="line_2800">Her tone was rather intimate. It was only natural, since Elmesia and Leon had known each other for an extensive period of time. Not only were they close as rulers and important business partners, but as friends as well. The fact that Leon was permitted to enter this venue showed a glimpse of the level of their friendship. He was already acquainted with Elmesia even before he became a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. At the time, Leon was still called a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and had operated within this land—within the boundaries of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The two had been friends ever since.</p>
<p id="line_2801">“I wouldn’t smile considering the predicament I’m in,” Leon said.</p>
<p id="line_2802">“But I seldom see you smile as is.”</p>
<p id="line_2803">“Does that really matter? I don’t have the time for it. We should cut to the chase—”</p>
<p id="line_2804">“Ah, right, right, I got some desserts from Yoshida-san’s shop, do you want some?” Elmesia offered, interrupting Leon. As if on cue, her servants pulled up the dining cart and began promptly serving the cakes.</p>
<p id="line_2805">“I’m not a fan of sweets.”</p>
<p id="line_2806">“Hmm—but this is soooo delicious. Ah, the cookie seems to have tea leaves blended in. It’s not that sweet. I heard they called this a matcha cookie.”</p>
<p id="line_2807">“—Fine, I’ll eat then.”</p>
<p id="line_2808"><em>It’s no use arguing with Elmesia</em>, Leon judged based on his own experience. The same could be said for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Ramiris. Leon felt that all these difficult characters had a common trait: they were all woefully stubborn. And as a result, Leon had given up on them a long time ago. Suppressing the anxiety welling within, he gingerly reached out for a cookie.</p>
<p id="line_2809">“So sweet…”</p>
<p id="line_2810">“Ara? Is that <em>still</em> too sweet for you?”</p>
<p id="line_2811">“No, it’s not too bad.”</p>
<p id="line_2812">“Ho—you really aren’t the straightforward type. Anyway, it doesn’t matter. What brings you here today? Are you going to ask me whether or not I’ve seen some kids in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s kingdom?” Elmesia guessed.</p>
<p id="line_2813">Leon was relieved. <em>She’s just like always. I can never let my guard down against this woman. Has she already gotten hold of my situation?</em></p>
<p id="line_2814">With that being said, this conversation would go a lot faster. Leon adjusted his approach immediately.</p>
<p id="line_2815">“Yes. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seems to have a rather strong opinion about me. It’s likely because one of my previous subordinates came into contact with him and got something into his head.”</p>
<p id="line_2816">“I am aware. Shizue Izawa, was it? That <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nicknamed ‘The Conqueror of Flames.’ She is even quite famous in this country.”</p>
<p id="line_2817">“How did you know? My relationship with Shizu should have been highly classified—”</p>
<p id="line_2818">“Oops, how about we get to the real business? Aren’t you short on time?”</p>
<p id="line_2819">Leon felt a little irritated.</p>
<p id="line_2820"><em>And who do you think is wasting my precious time?</em> He wanted to shout at Elmesia but managed to hold back. Leon decided to cut to the chase.</p>
<p id="line_2821">“Right, then, I suppose. I’ve been planning to send an invitation to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the near future. I want to resolve our misunderstanding. Moreover, antagonizing that guy would be way too dangerous.”</p>
<p id="line_2822">It was quite rare for Leon to be dragged around the ear like this. He could hold his own in conversation even while confronting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, yet he was hopeless against Elmesia.</p>
<p id="line_2823">“Ara? If it’s you, surely you would be able to win against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, no?” Elmesia asked Leon almost teasingly.</p>
<p id="line_2824">But Leon wasn’t so easily provoked, either.</p>
<p id="line_2825">“It’s not a matter of whether I can win or not; it’s meaningless to antagonize him. There isn’t any benefit to it, and on the contrary, there are way too many downsides.”</p>
<p id="line_2826"><em>Haven’t you come to the same conclusion?</em>—Leon conveyed with a sharp glance.</p>
<p id="line_2827">To that, Elmesia agreed, “I suppose. Moreover, forging an alliance with him would be greatly beneficial. Even though I fear the possibility that he would change his mind, I still decided to move forward with the alliance anyways.”</p>
<p id="line_2828">Leon, naturally, would be inclined to see things the same way. He’d guessed that Elmesia would make a judgement along those lines.</p>
<p id="line_2829">“Indeed. I personally would welcome a negotiable <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Considering <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, when compared to the other <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s—or rather, when compared to the former <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Frey—he’s a better candidate to ally with. However, there is one problem—”</p>
<p id="line_2830">“You mean what you’ve been doing all this time?”</p>
<p id="line_2831">“…”</p>
<p id="line_2832"><em>No</em>—While that’s what Leon <em>wanted</em> to say, considering his current circumstances, he couldn’t deny it. In reality, Leon indeed had treated Shizu poorly, which led to this rocky relationship with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2833">“Fine, it doesn’t matter,” Elmesia continued. “I will make my move on the matter soon. If Tempest were to start a war with El Dorado, we would be very troubled, too. By the way, you were going to ask me about the children, right? I did see them. They seemed to be enjoying themselves during the festival.”</p>
<p id="line_2834">“Is this true? Then—”</p>
<p id="line_2835">“Ara ara, one step at a time now. Mmh, this cake is sooooo delicious!”</p>
<p id="line_2836">Leon almost lost his usual calm demeanor.</p>
<p id="line_2837"><em>That’s why I didn’t want to come here</em>, Leon cursed internally. But now wasn’t the time for that.</p>
<p id="line_2838">“Well then, among the children, was there a young girl called Chloe?”</p>
<p id="line_2839">Asking straight on was a very risky move. Leon had always been very cautious, not knowing whether Elmesia would betray him or not. He always avoided doing things that could expose Chloe to danger. However, Leon also treated Elmesia as a friend. Under these dire circumstances, he didn’t want to hold back. With all that in mind, Leon decided to reveal his secret.</p>
<p id="line_2840">“Have you finally decided to trust me? Very well, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon, since you are willing to believe me, I shall generously offer you a helping hand,” Elmesia announced to Leon, suddenly changing her demeanor.</p>
<p id="line_2841">And so, the two began to exchange their information.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2842">There were five children under the protection of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>: Kenya Misaki, Ryota Sekiguchi, Gail Gibson, Alice Rondo, and finally—Chloe <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Aubert" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The name of the girl Leon had been searching for all his life.</p>
<p id="line_2843">“—Did you know this from the start?”</p>
<p id="line_2844">“You’re always a man of few words. Aren’t you afraid that people may misunderstand you? You always keep your thoughts to yourself and expect to carry all the responsibilities on your own. Isn’t this why even the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="champion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Shizue Izawa never trusted you, ex-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san?”</p>
<p id="line_2845">Had Leon been willing to be more genuine with Shizu, the relationship between the two may have been very different.</p>
<p id="line_2846">Elmesia was being sarcastic about it. In truth, she knew Leon had a kind heart, but knowing this was why she couldn’t stand how he had become a fearful <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of this world.</p>
<p id="line_2847">“Hmph,” Leon replied, “quit with the boring speculation. I’ve sacrificed a ton—a shit ton of people for my own sake. If I can save her, I don’t give a shit what method I use. I’ll take any blame that comes with it.”</p>
<p id="line_2848">That was Leon’s genuine thought. This man used to be the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who protected humanity. When he realized kind deeds would no longer achieve his goals, he was willing to bloody his hands to get the job done. At that point it was too late to just sweep it under the rug. He didn’t say these things as an excuse for his actions, it was simply what Leon lived by, his belief.</p>
<p id="line_2849">“You are as stubborn as a mule. Even Chloe-chan would dislike you being like this.”</p>
<p id="line_2850">“Shut up already. Then, does <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> do a good job caring for the kids? If so, it seems like there’s some dipshit who wants to lure me out for whatever scheme they have.”</p>
<p id="line_2851">“’Is it the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, or maybe Cerberus? I even have my suspicions on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’—isn’t that what you are worried about, Leon-kun?”</p>
<p id="line_2852">“Just <em>how</em> much do you know?” Leon muttered, feeling powerless and utterly baffled. Reconfirming the massive intelligence network Elmesia possessed, he felt it was right to have asked for her help. He genuinely thought Elmesia was terrifying, not in terms of her combat ability, but her political strength. Indeed, anyone who could push Leon against the wall was no mere simpleton.</p>
<p id="line_2853">“Right then, I’ll stop teasing you. According to my investigation, Tempest and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> are free from strife. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> ostensibly decided to abide by the treaty she made with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in earnest. That is readily apparent by observing the actions of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Commander <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. However, it is a lot harder to judge on the side of Cerberus. That organization is a complete mystery, and the higher-ups of it never really worked hand-in-hand either. They seem to have deliberately created this impression for outsiders, so the information I could get from within the organization was limited. Let’s reserve our opinion on the matter for now. On the other hand, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> family is certainly bad news.

Even the agents of the Foreign Intelligence Agency of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Siltrosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> have all come out in full force. The whole area has been in a state of unrest because of it.”</p>
<p id="line_2854">The defenses of the Northern countries were stretched thin, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> faced a war at their doorstep. These were the two major locations Elmesia pointed out. However, the information she just gave Leon had the potential to stir up great amounts of trouble.</p>
<p id="line_2855">“Then <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would move out.”</p>
<p id="line_2856">That being <em>the</em> problem in question. To be more precise, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wouldn’t move out, however, every one of his subordinates under the sun would rampage.

<p id="line_2857">Elmesia knew this all too well herself. But even if it were just his subordinates, it would still present a major crisis for humanity.

<p id="line_2859">Elmesia gazed at Leon, looking particularly troubled.</p>
<p id="line_2860">“Oi, I…!”</p>
<p id="line_2861">“Leon-kun, you’re back to speaking in your old tone like from before, aren’t you?”</p>
<p id="line_2862">“Uh, I was just…”</p>
<p id="line_2863">“You don’t have to act tough and play cool all the time. It’s so cute when you do something like this, but I don’t have the time to tease you right now.”</p>
<p id="line_2864">She even teased him during times like these. Leon was truly amazed by how easy-going Elmesia was.</p>
<p id="line_2865">“Sorry, I’m simply fixed on my goal. I’d like to negotiate with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but that guy’s got a bad temper.

<p id="line_2866">“I understand. If we don’t show him that we would fight back with our own strength, that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would likely lose interest in humanity. Right now, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight Order" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is in a bind, so I have no choice but to send the Magus to reinforce the guards of the Northern realm.

<p id="line_2867">“…Can I really?”</p>
<p id="line_2868">“Of course, didn’t I tell you to take your time? Now then, you are on a clock, right? Hurry up and get going.”</p>
<p id="line_2869">The situation was more dire than Leon had imagined. Despite how strong he was, he could not teleport to somewhere he had never been before. Moreover, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was protected by a barrier.

<p id="line_2870">Leon gratefully accepted Elmesia’s proposal with a, “Sorry for the trouble.”</p>
<p id="line_2871">“If only you were always so straightforward. Right right, I think this goes without saying, but Cerberus definitely wanted to drag you into all this. It’s one hundred percent a trap!”</p>
<p id="line_2872">To Elmesia’s warning, Leon replied with two words: “I know.”</p>
<p id="line_2873">Elmesia answered, “I figured as much,” with a tinge of sadness in her smile.</p>
<p id="line_2874">Leon was just like this in the past. Never showing weakness in front of anyone, aiming to achieve his goal no matter what got in his way. That young man had an unbreakable will. He lived his life like a true <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It was the same when he became a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2875"><em>And he’s just as clumsy. Nothing has changed since back then…</em></p>
<p id="line_2876">Elmesia had conflicted feelings about him.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2877">Before boarding the dragon ship, Leon suddenly recalled a warning he meant to relay to Elmesia. Turning towards her, he said: “Consider this a token of gratitude from me. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yellow Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has disappeared. So be careful yourself.”</p>
<p id="line_2878">“Huh?!” Elmesia blurted in shock.</p>
<p id="line_2879">Leon cracked up seeing the look on her face.</p>
<p id="line_2880">“Wasn’t your hobby collecting information? Looks like you didn’t know that. I’m happy though, as it seems like I was of some help to you.”</p>
<p id="line_2881">Leaving these words, Leon savored the taste of victory as he left.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2882">After Leon departed—</p>
<p id="line_2883">“This can’t be true, right? Three <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, and it had to happen when half of the Magus was out. What the hell have I gotten myself into… But, had it not been the case, Leon-kun likely would not have acted either. I guess I still have to sharpen my observational skills…”</p>

<p id="line_2890">“Yes ma’am! Enemy numbers are unknown, however, it’s certain that it is close to a hundred men. They’re at least as strong as rank B-plus. Seeing how they were acting, they know the layout of our nation very well.”</p>
<p id="line_2891">Nearly a hundred B-plus ranked soldiers were a force to be reckoned with. He also mentioned that they were familiar with the layout of the city—they were most likely <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s men.</p>
<p id="line_2892">“—Regarding casualties, several novice knights were injured. There have been several deaths and wounded among the Pope’s Imperial Guards. Fortunately, no civilians have been harmed,” the envoy answered swiftly, describing heavy losses.</p>
<p id="line_2893">Had this happened in my nation, I would have lost my mind (again). But since I was a guest here, it would be best that I stayed out of other people’s business. That sounded quite cold, but this wasn’t my country to run.</p>

<p id="line_2897">“By the way, you mentioned it happened in the Grand Cathedral, is that the place where we set up all the instruments?”</p>
<p id="line_2898">If that were the case, we would have a <em>big</em> problem.</p>
<p id="line_2899">Yesterday, the band members set up their instruments at this Grand Cathedral and did a rehearsal. I figured that there weren’t exactly <em>a lot</em> of Grand Cathedrals in the nation, so I had a bad feeling about this. And yet it was in times like these that my prediction—</p>
<p id="line_2900">“There is no other facility called the Grand Cathedral except for that.”</p>
<p id="line_2901">—Tended to come true…</p>
<p id="line_2902">I mean, it was infallible.</p>

<p id="line_2904">His smile was unfazed, indicating “No problem” to me. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to be contacting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Venom" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> through ‘Telepathy Net’ as soon as the envoy had arrived.

The members of the band were already inside the Grand Cathedral; however, the defenses around them were flawless. No suspicious individuals had been able to approach them, and they carried on their final rehearsal, as planned.</p>
<p id="line_2906">“With all hell breaking loose around them, those guys sure are bold.”</p>
<p id="line_2907">“Kufufufufu, that’s only natural. If they couldn’t even handle something this trivial, they wouldn’t be qualified to be my subordinates.”</p>
<p id="line_2908">This man’s confidence was something I could only hope to attain.</p>
<p id="line_2909">“Never mind that, let’s not idle here and head to the Grand Cathedral at once,” I said with a pretentious air.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2910">I opened a portal to the cathedral using ‘Spatial Domination.’ I had gotten pretty good at using it, so even when I was here—inside <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, which was protected by a holy barrier—I could still use it without a hitch. It was probably because they didn’t put up barriers that would prevent teleportation inside.</p>
<p id="line_2911">“—Phew, I don’t even have the energy to mock you anymore, just take me there too,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san said, looking exhausted.</p>
<p id="line_2912"><em>Why are you so tired this early in the morning?</em> Although I felt like I’d get scolded for saying so, possibly even considered a creep, so I decided to just keep quiet. I wanted to make strides in improving myself too and outlive the days of being called an air-head.</p>
<p id="line_2913">A man named <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Nicolaus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> came along as well. The fact that he was preparing breakfast for us led me to believe that he was a servant at first.

He was wearing some sort of a high-class robe beneath his apron, so this guy was legit.

I felt that there were more and more mysteries as we spoke.</p>
<p id="line_2914">—Uh, but they probably weren’t that important.</p>
<p id="line_2915">The children were in the Grand Cathedral as well. They were very energetic this morning, so I let them go first. Even though the defenses were thorough, this world was full of surprises and I had no way to predict what might happen. I adjusted my mood a bit and headed to the Grand Cathedral in a hurry.</p>

He turned his eyes to the band members and raised his conductor baton.</p>
<p id="line_2923">They seemed to have noticed my presence as their eyes found me. Not sure if that was the reason or not, but the band members were seemingly at ease and calm again. There were even smiles on everyone’s faces.</p>
<p id="line_2924">“Then let’s get back to practice!”</p>

He began to practice again; the rest of the members followed almost as if nothing had happened. And then, with fine coordination, beautiful notes of music began to fill the air. It was a powerful and intense performance which overshadowed even the sound of the fighting. I couldn’t help but feel proud of the band members. Fighting with a score in the background; it almost felt like a stage drama.</p>
<p id="line_2926">But it went without saying that this was authentic combat.</p>

<p id="line_3002">Indeed, it was thanks to my help that the captains were only knocked out. When I realized what was coming, I activated ‘Absolute Defense.’ Otherwise, the three would probably have been obliterated.

<p id="line_3003">The ‘Absolute Defense’ of Ultimate Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Covenant King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Uriel’ could block any attack.

However, even when it was a perfect Skill to use on myself, when applied to someone else—in fact, multiple other people—its precision took a hit.</p>
<p id="line_3004">For me, it was okay even if some attacks landed, since I had my ‘Infinite Regeneration.’ Any injuries would be quickly regenerated, meaning I could achieve perfect defense.</p>
<p id="line_3005">But it was different for the three captains. This small amount of shockwave that slipped through my ‘Absolute Defense’ sent them to death’s doorstep. It was an extremely close call.</p>

<p id="line_3010">Actually, now that I thought about it carefully, there was indeed a possibility.

<p id="line_3017">“What? You bastard…”</p>
<p id="line_3018">The children and the band members were all inside the Grand Cathedral. Even though I ordered <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and the other guards there, if they were to start fighting inside, some people may be affected as a result.

<p id="line_3019">After settling on the idea, I decided to ‘Teleport’ back to the Grand Cathedral.</p>
<p id="line_3020">Yet I was interrupted by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, these people shall be your opponents.

<p id="line_3022">The word “countrymen” was a bit too worrying; I immediately caught on what he had meant. Their ages varied and consisted of different ethnicities too. At first, the composition seemed to be disorganized, but they all shared one common point in core, and that was that every single one of them possessed a magicule content far exceeding the average person’s.</p>
<p id="line_3023">“Otherworlders, huh? I see, no wonder some of them may be Japanese like me as well.”</p>
<p id="line_3024"><em>Uh, there’s no time to idle around</em>—since more than ten otherworlders were charging at me simultaneously. It looked like they were controlled by a curse like Glenda. Even their free will seemed to have been deprived. Under this state, even if I were to break their curse, they probably wouldn’t stop, either.</p>
<p id="line_3025">But…</p>
<p id="line_3026">“Kukuku, do you truly intend to fight them? These people are only being manipulated by me, you know?”</p>
<p id="line_3027">What a cunning man.</p>
<p id="line_3028">He told me this deliberately, probably thinking it would keep me from making a move. While I didn’t want to give up like this, I had to admit that it was a very effective method.</p>
<p id="line_3029">“I heard that you go soft very easily. Are you hesitant to extend your killing hand to the innocent? Or will you see this as warfare and choose to defend yourself? Either way is fine.”</p>
<p id="line_3030"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> merely considered the summoned otherworlders as his weapons. In truth, they were just like simple consumable items to him. Even if I were to kill them all, he would probably act just like how he proclaimed, completely untroubled. What a very difficult opponent. He had done some extensive research on me.</p>
<p id="line_3031">If he were to run into people like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they would have cleaned house without hesitation.

<p id="line_3032">“Ahhh, dammit! So troublesome…!”</p>
<p id="line_3033">There was no time for complaints. If I didn’t act fast enough, the children would be in danger, and the casualties would increase too.</p>
<p id="line_3034">At this point, there was only one way out. It was complicated, but I could manage—dispelling their curse one by one and knocking them out non-lethally.</p>
<p id="line_3035">With that, I was roped into battle as well.</p>

<p id="line_3037">Some of these otherworlders might actually not be from Earth; was it possible that they came from some other planet or dimension? Perhaps these thoughts indicated that I’d regained some of my cool.</p>
<p id="line_3038">Otherworlders had very strong constitutions, and they may possess some unknown special abilities. It went without saying that they were dangerous, but they posed no threat against me right now. Even if I were completely unguarded, they wouldn’t have been able to harm me, even if they sent that Glenda. That’s just how overpowered when ‘Absolute Defense’ was combined with ‘Infinite Regeneration.’</p>
<p id="line_3039">While they were difficult to handle, they were just that. I could probably manage to paralyze them all given some time, and without harming them during the process.

At first, I thought that it was because of the difference in our strength, but it wasn’t the only reason: their free wills had been taken by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Moreover, there was also—</p>
<p id="line_3227">«Answer. During this battle, none of them used their Unique Skills.»</p>
<p id="line_3228">Ah, that’s it!</p>
<p id="line_3229">I get it now, so that’s how it is. None of the people I had been fighting launched any special attacks, that’s why the task of paralyzing them was so monotonous. In other words, even though there were so many otherworlders, none of them had a Unique Skill? Were they all holding back against me? No matter what the truth was, it felt strange. Anyhow, no matter what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s goal was, it’d all be resolved when I beat him.</p>
<p id="line_3230">After settling on the idea, I approached the last otherworlder. She looked rather young, around ten. She was probably old enough for magicule to settle properly inside her body. The child only wielded empty power, nothing challenging. I undid the curse skillfully. Everything proceeded smoothly. When she regained her consciousness, she seemed confused at the situation. I didn’t have the time to explain everything in detail to her, so I quickly knocked her out and let her lie down with the others.</p>
<p id="line_3231">There were several kids like her, so it was really difficult for me to handle them. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t seem to care about them at all, but I still managed to figure out a solution. His goal was probably to win some time. Had I been serious, it wouldn’t take much time to kill them all. It looked like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> achieved his goal in that regard.</p>
<p id="line_3232">But with this, all the otherworlders fighting me had been paralyzed. I didn’t know why he wanted to stall time, and truthfully, I didn’t really care at this point. I simply wanted to finish this battle as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="line_3233">Judging so, I turned to the battlefield to get hold of some information.</p>
<p id="line_3234">The children were all fine, so I could rest assured for now. Even under these circumstances, the band members were still practicing with utmost effort. Should I call them bold? Perhaps it was a good way to reduce stress by focusing all your attention on something.</p>
<p id="line_3235"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were both standing their ground in the duel; as expected from masters of combat. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the two were fighting at ultra-high speed. They were exchanging blows in a brilliant display of their masterful techniques, where a single mistake could not be tolerated. A misstep on my part might throw out the current balance and lead to either one’s swift defeat. I figured it would be best if I focused my attention on them later.</p>
<p id="line_3236"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Ranga were being suppressed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Razul" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>; however, his advantage wasn’t enough to guarantee victory. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> allowed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Razul" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to land his blows on her since all of her wounds could automatically be healed. ‘Ultra-Speed Regeneration’ was really a cheating Skill. No matter how vast the difference in strength, she could still rely on this Skill to get an edge.</p>
<p id="line_3237">Ranga, on the other hand, focused on landing attacks. He hid in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s shadow and targeted <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Razul" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s blind spots. He was also casting magic attacks such as ‘Death Heralding Wind’ and ‘Black Lightning.’</p>
<p id="line_3238">The clever method of combat was impressive. The problem was, however, that none of these attacks were working on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Razul" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. In fact, he was very different. I recalled that Apito and Zegion were both insect type <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> like him. Their compound eyes could apparently watch their blind spots clearly, therefore he even evaded Ranga’s sneak attacks with ease. Basically, unless it was a powerful attack, it wouldn’t work on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Razul" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3239">The thing that looked like black armor on him was his exoskeleton. It was harder than steel. He could block <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s odachi with the shell of his left hand alone. It was ridiculously tough; therefore, nothing would work except an attack to the joints. It could also deflect Ranga’s magic, so the surface of his exoskeleton had an effect similar to ‘Magic Interference.’</p>
<p id="line_3240">If that was the case, no wonder <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had a tough time fighting. He excelled at using magic, so <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Razul" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be his natural counter. With that being said, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> probably had other means to defeat him.</p>
<p id="line_3241">With advantages in both physical and magical defense, this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Razul" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was something else.

<p id="line_3242">On that note, I decided to take care of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Razul" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3243">I swung around to the entrance of the Grand Cathedral. I couldn’t help but immediately tense for a fight.

It was only natural.</p>
<p id="line_3244">After all, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon, who wasn’t supposed to be here, was standing right there. Under his white robe was a high-quality knight uniform and golden armor. As always, he was a real handsome dude, though he seemed to be in a terribly foul mood. Leon was not alone; several knights were behind him. They all gave off a powerful aura. It looked like he only brought his lieutenants.</p>
<p id="line_3245"><em>What is he doing here? Is he a friend or foe?</em></p>
<p id="line_3246">I figured that it was impossible for us to be on the same side, but I didn’t want to make Leon an enemy at this point.</p>

<p id="line_3248"><em>Wouldn’t the one with strength to spare be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?</em></p>
<p id="line_3249">He wasn’t fazed by what happened, yet he didn’t take the chance to attack <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> either.

<p id="line_3250">All in all, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to have known long ago that Leon would come. The suspicion was confirmed by the way he spoke. In other words, the two were on the same side.</p>
<p id="line_3251">“Don’t act all familiar now, who are you?”</p>
<p id="line_3252">“Oh yeah, this is our first time meeting. As a matter of fact, all the children you bought in the past were gathered by me. I must apologize to have troubled you to come here personally for the delivery this time.”</p>
<p id="line_3253">“…”</p>
<p id="line_3254"><em>Maybe they weren’t together?</em></p>
<p id="line_3255">It looked like Leon and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were just meeting for the first time. But it could’ve all been an act too… Now that they had mentioned it, most of the otherworlders beaten by me were not adults yet. They were mostly kids around the age of middle-schoolers. Could it be that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was referring to—</p>

<p id="line_3262">No matter how you see it, it was a horrible move to antagonize Leon now.

<p id="line_3264">I could no longer ignore it now. Shizu-san was summoned by Leon and abandoned by him. Not only so, Leon seemed to have summoned other kids too. Such an evil deed could not go unpunished.</p>

<p id="line_3268">The supplier should have a moral code too. To push all the responsibilities to the consumer is against my philosophy. But compared to that, I wanted to confirm something else.</p>

<p id="line_3271">“Even when you knew that unstable children wouldn’t survive for long?”</p>
<p id="line_3272">“That—”</p>
<p id="line_3273">As Leon was about to say something, a thunderous laugh rang out at the scene, interrupting him. It was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3274">“Kukuku, ku-HAHAHAHA! How funny, Leon. Wasn’t your request for us to provide ‘Otherworld children under the age of ten’! As opposed to performing stable summonings of otherworlders and commanding that, why not ‘rescue’ unstable children and do them a favor? And then manipulate them to make them your weapons, didn’t you?!”</p>
<p id="line_3275">These were incendiary words; <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s goal was obvious. He knew that I was soft-hearted and wanted to exploit that trait. In other words, he wanted to provoke my sense of justice and turn me against Leon.</p>
<p id="line_3276">However—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words actually had very high credibility. For the spirits to possess the children, the summoned ones needed to be in the so-called ‘unstable state’ <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> mentioned.</p>
<p id="line_3277"><em>Is it really the reason? Is this why all Leon’s subordinates are shrouded in the auras of spirits?</em></p>
<p id="line_3278">“…Is this true?”</p>
<p id="line_3279">“Yes. But I have my reason—”</p>
<p id="line_3280">“Shut up! So this really <em>was</em> your doing!” I shouted and went straight for Leon.</p>
<p id="line_3281">I couldn’t relinquish my anger without punching the guy in the face. Even knowing that it was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s scheme, I couldn’t dismiss my anger towards Leon. We’d talk about reasons later, I had to relieve some of my hatred first.</p>
<p id="line_3282">And so, I used all my force to punch Leon. He didn’t move. He stopped all his subordinates trying to protect him and looked straight into my eyes.</p>
<p id="line_3283">Did that mean it’d be simple for him to take care of me? Or was it—</p>
<p id="line_3284">My fist was rapidly closing in on Leon’s face, faster than my accelerated thoughts could follow.</p>
<p id="line_3285">Leon didn’t even flinch.</p>
<p id="line_3286">«—Subject displays no signs of evasion, brace for impact.»</p>
<p id="line_3287">There was no trap. The next second, my fist connected with Leon’s right cheek.</p>
<p id="line_3288">“—You got it out of your system now?”</p>
<p id="line_3289">I struck with my full force, yet it didn’t cause a lot of damage to Leon. His lip seemed to be split as he wiped the blood from it with a handkerchief, yet he didn’t move an inch.</p>
<p id="line_3290">Tsk, even though I hadn’t applied any Skill with the strike, clearly, I underestimated Leon a bit. It was with that punch that I realized something. I felt that this guy—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon—was a lot kinder than I expected. The proof was that he took the hit when he was completely unguarded, even though, by any reason, he didn’t have to let me do it at all. While his demeanor always gave an impression of cruelty, he wasn’t that bad a person at heart.</p>
<p id="line_3291">Shizu-san didn’t hate Leon. She wanted to hate him but could not do it no matter how. She wanted to check Leon’s genuine thoughts—that was Shizu-san’s dying wish.</p>
<p id="line_3292">There was no need for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san to give me any advice. I was calm from the start. I had made a promise with Shizu-san.

To fulfill that promise, I made use of this situation.</p>
<p id="line_3293">There must have been reasons behind Leon’s action. I’d decide whether I should forgive him later. During such chaotic circumstances, antagonizing Leon would undoubtedly be suicidal. This was no time to judge based on emotion.</p>
<p id="line_3294">Leon wasn’t on my side, nor was he the enemy—knowing this, I gave my answer.</p>
<p id="line_3295">“Not enough. Even though I’ve conveyed Shizu-san’s feelings, my feud with you hasn’t been resolved yet. About that, we are gonna have a nice <em>chat</em> about it now?”</p>
<p id="line_3296">Now, did he get what I meant?</p>
<p id="line_3297">Leon’s eyebrow twitched slightly. By the looks of it, Leon was no fool either; now I was reassured. Then let’s have a nice chat—about how to handle <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

It was no longer the appearance of an asian person. While he kept Shizu’s form, his beauty was on a different level.</p>
<p id="line_3300">As his golden eyes gazed at Leon deeply, he opened his pink lips and said, “Not enough. Even though I’ve conveyed Shizu-san’s feelings, my feud with you hasn’t been resolved yet. About that, we are gonna have a nice <em>chat</em> about it now?”</p>
<p id="line_3301">While <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said this, Leon immediately caught on to the meaning behind his words.</p>
<p id="line_3302"><em>I see, so he wants to utilize this situation? In other words, even though he doesn’t know me too well, he decided to trust me, nonetheless? This guy is surprisingly bold.</em></p>
<p id="line_3303">Leon didn’t dislike it.</p>

It was to differentiate who was friend and foe under these chaotic circumstances.</p>
<p id="line_3305"><em>I thought that I shouldn’t lower my guard against this guy, but with everything that’s going on, he turned out to be quite reliable.</em></p>
<p id="line_3306">While thinking so, Leon drew the sword by his waist and assumed a combat stance.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3307">Earlier, aboard the dragon ship on his way to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Leon received an emergency message via ‘Magic Communication’ from the secret organization ‘Cerberus.’</p>
<p id="line_3308">The message stated that one of their intelligence personnel lost contact, likely due to his real identity being discovered by someone. This <em>someone</em> could be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or the Five Great Elders.

Since the person in question had lost contact after being captured, it was only natural to be suspicious of anyone.</p>
<p id="line_3309">However, Leon was not dumb enough to trust the words of Cerberus. This could be a well-drafted plot aimed at deceiving Leon. There was only one thing he was sure of—heading to the holy land now would mean entering a trap voluntarily. But even so, it wasn’t enough to shake Leon’s resolve.</p>
<p id="line_3310"><em>It doesn’t matter if it’s a trap, as long as Chloe is there—</em>no matter what danger lay ahead, Leon didn’t care.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3311">Fast forwarding to the present, Leon had finally calmed down as he drew his sword against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_3312">The Magic Knight Order elites who were protecting Leon somehow got mixed in the fight as well. They were cleverly lured into battle by someone and started fighting with the local forces at the holy land.</p>

<p id="line_3314">‹Understood!›</p>
<p id="line_3315">Leon gave his order to Silver Knight Alrose. Even though he used an encrypted channel, the presence of eavesdroppers was to be expected. He had already prepared himself for that and only gave orders that were intended to avoid future problems.</p>

<p id="line_3471">The delegates of every nation had gathered for an emergency council meeting and were quarreling endlessly without a solution in sight.</p>
<p id="line_3472">The Western States Council was an organization formed by delegates of its member states. Even though the council’s decisions held great weight, it would also waste a lot of time in following procedure during emergency situations.

<p id="line_3474">That was how important the land was as a strategic location. If it were to fall, it would be a matter of life or death for humanity. No wonder why the councilors that had gathered were in such a panicked state.</p>
<p id="line_3475">Right now, the final line of defense was barely holding on as the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s and adventurers stationed there were taking the brunt of things. Based on the dire situation that was unfolding, they needed to send reinforcements immediately.</p>
<p id="line_3476">However, there wasn’t enough time.</p>
<p id="line_3477">While this might have already been accomplished with authoritarian states, since the decision was made by a league consisting of independent entities, they needed to request approval from their respective home nations first. The quickest solution right now was to issue an emergency request to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

On the other hand, since it would likely weaken the defense of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s capital, they definitely would not approve of this decision.</p>
<p id="line_3479">Speaking of which, the responsibility of defending the northern realm had always been managed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, so it wouldn’t be unreasonable if they were to request additional troops from other nations. Just like what one of the unnamed councilors had already shouted, it was more viable to form a coalition army.</p>
<p id="line_3480">Even so, there was a catch: the soldiers dispatched by various nations would be led by the newcomer—the Jura-Tempest Federation.</p>
<p id="line_3481">The motion had passed with unanimous support, so one would expect zero complaints. Yet, to the councilors, willfully handing over their nation’s precious military to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a hard pill to swallow.</p>
<p id="line_3482">“Please remain silent!” the Speaker of the Western States Council shouted, trying to restore order in the hall.</p>
<p id="line_3483">The eyes of the other councilors fell on the Speaker as he addressed his audience. “Right now, we are faced with an unprecedented crisis. Rather than arguing, you should try to establish contact with your home nations as soon as possible and order their troops here.

<p id="line_3484">While some were against the Speaker’s view, they weren’t bold enough to voice their protests. And because there weren’t any alternative solutions, complaining here would only worsen the situation.</p>
<p id="line_3485">At this point, every councilor’s eyes were fixed on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_3511">Some of them rejected the idea…</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_3514">Not long after, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> suddenly stood up.</p>
<p id="line_3515">“I get it now, it was you. You’ve hidden yourself quite well.”</p>
<p id="line_3516">This happened so abruptly, the councilors were all confused about what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was saying.</p>
<p id="line_3517">Although, there was one person’s face that turned pale, with sweat dripping down his cheeks, when <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gazed at him.</p>
<p id="line_3518">He was one of the Five Great Elders. The Duke of the Kingdom of Rostia, Johann Rostia.</p>
<p id="line_3519">“W-what did I do?” Trying his hardest to hide his inner panic, Johann questioned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in return.

<p id="line_3520">Johann lost his composure and reacted first.</p>
<p id="line_3521">“A-as expected, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> are indeed untrustworthy! We have to use our own strength to protect humanity. Guards, guards, get over here!” he shouted, acting all serious. His face was covered with a thin sheen of perspiration, desperately trying to fight the fear he felt. In contrast, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s smile deepened.</p>
<p id="line_3522">Noticing Johann’s order, soldiers quickly charged into the meeting hall, his personal guards among them too. He quickly regained his composure.</p>
<p id="line_3523"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began playing with her hair, looking elegant as she did so, while the other councilors fell into disorder again.</p>
<p id="line_3524">What Johann had done was completely out of line. Even if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was bearing malicious intent, an unlawful act that purposefully ignored the rules of the council would not be tolerated. Regardless of how important Johann’s position was, such reckless behavior was unsanctioned.</p>
<p id="line_3525">“You there, your name is Johann Rostia, correct? The Duke of Rostia, a rather prestigious position.”</p>
<p id="line_3526">“S-so what? It’s no use flattering me now—”</p>
<p id="line_3527">“Johann-dono, who were you communicating with via ‘Magic Communication’ just now?”</p>
<p id="line_3528">“What…!”</p>
<p id="line_3529">“Why did you give the order to disrupt this nation’s ‘Defensive Barrier’?”</p>
<p id="line_3530">“H-how did you…”</p>
<p id="line_3531">“Could you please tell me why?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> pressured Johann to answer with the demeanor of someone casually chatting in a tea party.</p>
<p id="line_3532">The other councilors were all flabbergasted. There was no time to panic anymore. They immediately ordered their subordinates to confirm the ‘Defensive Barrier’ of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s capital.</p>
<p id="line_3533">Before they could get an answer—</p>
<p id="line_3534">Everyone felt the rumbling that slowly started occurring in every direction, like an earthquake.</p>
<p id="line_3535">“Could this be true…!”</p>
<p id="line_3536">“How could you destroy the barrier?! This means it can’t prevent <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> from invading anymore! This will bring catastrophe upon the civilians!”</p>
<p id="line_3537">“Seriously, what in the world is going on! Johann-dono, please give us an explanation!”</p>
<p id="line_3538">Seeing someone more panicked than themselves, people would naturally be influenced by that as well, causing a positive feedback loop and eventually falling into a state of fear. Yet, if you were to take a step back in these circumstances, you would naturally regain composure.</p>
<p id="line_3539">Johann belonged to the latter category.</p>
<p id="line_3540">Knowing his plan had come to fruition, a serene smile emerged on his face.</p>
<p id="line_3541">“Girard-dono, the barrier has disappeared, and thus the time has come. Please summon that lord.”</p>
<p id="line_3542">Urged on by Johann, someone began to move. The councilors’ faces turned pale as they laid eyes on the man.</p>
<p id="line_3543">“T-that man, he’s the leader of the mercenary band ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Apostles of Verte" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’—”</p>

<p id="line_3546">“If that’s the case, what is Johann-dono planning?”</p>
<p id="line_3547">Ignoring the councilors’ comments, Girard stood by Johann’s side.</p>
<p id="line_3548">“Our contract is effectively complete as of this moment. Thank you for the assistance.”</p>
<p id="line_3549">“It’s nothing, but you’re welcome.

It just so happens to align with your goal. Come on then, no need to hold back. If you are going to do it, make it thorough, and turn this place into a living hell!” Johann declared, laughing maniacally.</p>
<p id="line_3550">The light of reason gradually dissipated from his eyes, and instead was replaced by his true vicious nature.</p>
<p id="line_3551">It was not until this moment that the councilors finally realized Johann was the traitor. Even so, the ‘Defensive Barrier’ of the capital had already been breached.</p>
<p id="line_3552">Seemingly grasping their situation, the councilors all looked desperate.</p>
<p id="line_3553">“Ayn, it’s time.”</p>
<p id="line_3554">“Umm, understood!”</p>
<p id="line_3555">Following Girard’s encouragement, the woman named Ayn commenced with her chanting. It was summoning magic.</p>
<p id="line_3556">Ayn was the leader of the labyrinth team ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ and a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="spirit wielder" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_3557">A dark oval-shaped portal appeared. A powerful being of undiluted strength crossed the gate and stepped in front of everyone. It was a green-haired beauty in a dark red maid outfit.

<p id="line_3558">Even the magical inquisitors that arrived after sensing the disturbance were petrified by this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_3630">“Do you really think I’ll just sit by and let you interfere? Girard-dono, it’s about time to give them a reality check.”</p>
<p id="line_3631">However, Girard, as he was being ordered around by Johann, was also confused by the scene in front of him.</p>

<p id="line_3633">Ayn was Girard’s lieutenant, and she had lost consciousness the instant <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon peer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mizeri" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was summoned. It likely cost much of her life force, but it was undoubtedly masterful work. The fact that she was even alive at all was commendable. Although, without the supernatural power of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mizeri" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, she would likely never wake up.

<p id="line_3634">With the unusual power of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mizeri" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it’d be a piece of cake slaughtering everyone at the scene.

<p id="line_3635">Girard was planning to flee with Ayn before that happened.

<p id="line_3636">However, things were going the opposite way of what Girard had envisioned.

<p id="line_3691">No one reacted. Not a single person was willing to lend him a helping hand.</p>

<p id="line_3785">Amidst the fierce combat—or rather, Laplace evading Louis’s pressing attacks and casually responding—it was not Louis who was observing him; instead, Laplace was the one analyzing Louis. It was evident from the expression of his eyes.</p>
<p id="line_3786">“Enough of this, aren’t you getting tired? Take a good nap for now,” Louis declared.</p>
<p id="line_3787">His attacks began to intensify.</p>
<p id="line_3788">“Told ya it’s useless.”</p>
<p id="line_3789">“Is that so? Then allow me to go even further.”</p>
<p id="line_3790">His tone did not change at all, yet Laplace had a bad feeling about this. His instincts were surprisingly accurate in times like these. He instantly darted away from the scene with overly theatrical movements.</p>
<p id="line_3791">His judgement was on the mark.</p>
<p id="line_3792">Louis’s attack split apart and decimated the location where Laplace was standing just a moment ago.</p>
<p id="line_3793">“—Uh! What is this power…?”</p>
<p id="line_3794">The latest attack held immense destructive potential. Had Laplace continued to underestimate Louis, he likely would not have been able to react quick enough, sustaining severe injuries as a result.</p>
<p id="line_3795">“Phew—I’m finally getting the hang of this. I’m surprised you managed to dodge that strike. Looks like you are not a simple man after all.”</p>
<p id="line_3796">“Ya wanted me to get careless so ya could take me out with that shot, right?”</p>
<p id="line_3797">“Well, I can’t say I didn’t. But I can still beat you without underhanded tricks like that.”</p>
<p id="line_3798">“What are ya on about?”</p>
<p id="line_3799">Laplace had slaughtered Roy. At the time, Roy had underestimated Laplace, but even if he hadn’t, Laplace’s strength was still far greater than that of Roy’s.</p>
<p id="line_3800">Regardless, Laplace did not get careless. Even when Roy acted as the body-double of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, his power still rivalled <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kazalim" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s. That was the undeniable truth. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kazalim" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was like a parent to Laplace and the clowns, and there was no way Laplace would let his guard down against someone of his caliber.</p>
<p id="line_3801">“Just now, that was the enhanced version of ‘Blood <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raine" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ Its magic aura was purposely hidden to lower my opponent’s guard. Although, once they’ve seen it in action, it is impossible to pull it off again.” Louis decided to explain his skill to Laplace, even though he was essentially showing his hand.</p>
<p id="line_3802">Yet hearing this worsened the ominous feeling in Laplace’s heart.</p>
<p id="line_3803"><em>This is bad. Is he stalling? The hell is this guy’s goal?</em></p>
<p id="line_3804">Laplace’s instinct told him that he was still in danger. He determined that he would fall into Louis’s trap at this rate, and decided to pull out his trump card immediately. There was no time for hesitation. A moment of indecision could cost him his life.</p>
<p id="line_3805">“—And that is why you will die here!” Louis roared as Laplace’s surroundings exploded.</p>
<p id="line_3806">The shockwaves from the explosion were concentrated at the center region where Laplace was standing. He had nowhere to run, since the ‘Blood Ray’ missiles had already locked onto him.</p>
<p id="line_3807">The victor had been decided.</p>
<p id="line_3808">Anyone would reach the same conclusion if they saw it.</p>
<p id="line_3809">The flames burnt fiercely.</p>
<p id="line_3810">A humanoid figure collapsed at the center.</p>
<p id="line_3811">“What a pity. Roy and I were the same person; it was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s power that separated us into two. Roy’s death had returned my original power back to me.”</p>
<p id="line_3812">In the past, there was once an extremely violent ‘Bloody Lord’ that no one dared to challenge. It was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who subjugated the man and recruited him into her service. But because of his sadistic and violent nature, he constantly clashed with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s other subordinates. It was then that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> decided to bisect the person, naming one of them as her right-hand man, the pope, and the other as her body-double, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3813">In other words, Louis had finally regained his old powers and became complete again. He was several times stronger than before. Even if Laplace’s power was above that of Roy’s, Louis still had confidence in winning.</p>
<p id="line_3814">And that was why—</p>
<p id="line_3815">“Terrifying. That was a close call.”</p>
<p id="line_3816">Louis felt a bit surprised to see Laplace raising his body and standing up.</p>
<p id="line_3817">There was no way Laplace would ignore such a good opportunity.</p>
<p id="line_3818">“Run away now, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, or ya gonna get killed!”</p>

Even though he wasn’t nearly as powerful as Louis in his complete form, he was still capable of rivalling <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3821">Laplace was able to meticulously analyze this aspect even during his battle with Louis. It would have been too easy for him to flee by himself, but there was no way Laplace was going to leave <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to his own demise.</p>

That being the case, it’s best for us to run away as soon as possible. We’ve done our job of stalling the enemies, so there’s no need to risk our necks any longer!</em> Laplace concluded.</p>
<p id="line_3823">He intentionally spoke up to distract Louis before taking action. His plan worked, and so both Laplace and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> managed to escape with their lives.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3824">Thus, only <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Maria <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> remained inside the tomb.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_3879">It seemed like Leon had caught on to the meaning behind my words. He was simply playing along and crossed swords with me.</p>
<p id="line_3880">To the eyes of bystanders, this certainly appeared to be an actual battle. If I were too careless, I could actually be killed by the slashes.</p>
<p id="line_3881">On that note, did he really understand me?</p>
<p id="line_3882">The look he gave told me that he probably knew <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was behind everything. We just had to wait for the right moment. And before that happened, we just needed to pretend to duel. At least that was how I envisioned it.

Since using a sword was not my only means of combat, I couldn’t help but add my own flair.

<p id="line_3885">In any case, that didn’t really matter; I was just complimenting how clean Leon’s attacks were.</p>
<p id="line_3886">It truly made me question whether he was actually planning to kill me with his attacks or not. In addition, Leon’s face was essentially an emotionless mask.

<p id="line_4196">These people were still alive, just knocked out. That was why Leon lowered his guard against them.</p>
<p id="line_4197">Normally, Leon would not have made such a mistake, but his head was a mess. Seeing the girl he’d been looking for disappear before his eyes shocked him.</p>

<p id="line_4225">Although I was angered by it, with them having left behind these difficult opponents and being able to flee scot-free—perhaps it was a good thing when considered from a different perspective.</p>
<p id="line_4226">It was impossible to tell whether he was an enemy or a friend—or in this case, a definite enemy. Therefore, you never knew if you were going to be stabbed in the back while working together with someone like that.</p>
<p id="line_4227">It could get ugly quick with there being two fronts. Rather than that, it was better to lock onto one single enemy. I’d have a better chance of winning.</p>
<p id="line_4228">In the Western Nations, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s influence was massive.</p>
<p id="line_4229">As long as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> supported my claims, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would lose all shred of credibility in the West.

Thus, I needn’t be so upset about his escape. I strengthened my resolve with these words, and fixed my eyes firmly on my enemy.</p>
<p id="line_4231">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, isn’t this…the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that sealed me?”</p>
<p id="line_4232">“It appears so.”</p>
<p id="line_4233">“It’s definitely her,” Veldora smugly declared. “Even when she’s not wearing the mask, the shape of her mouth is just how I remembered when I got a peek. I was right! She <em>is</em> beautiful!”</p>
<p id="line_4234">Even though this was hardly the time, how could he, a ‘True Dragon,’ judge human appearances? I was a bit curious.</p>
<p id="line_4235">In any case, my suspicion that Veldora “Only lost because he fell in love” was deepened.</p>
<p id="line_4236">“I agree that she’s stunning, but she’s our enemy now. Looks like she was sealed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> before and just went berserk. It sounds like it was a countermeasure to you, so could you please take responsibility and do something about it?”</p>
<p id="line_4237">“How rude. Why would anyone need some dramatic countermeasure for someone as upstanding as me?”</p>
<p id="line_4238"><em>Did you actually just say that out loud…</em></p>
<p id="line_4239">I was almost impressed, if not completely baffled.</p>
<p id="line_4240">But Veldora’s nonsense could wait.</p>
<p id="line_4241">“You can save your jokes for later. Please try to hold her back for a while and win me some time!”</p>
<p id="line_4242">“KUA-HAHAHA! Leave it to me! After all, fate has brought me the opportunity to fight her again. Would it be okay if I beat her?”</p>
<p id="line_4243"><em>Oh oh, so cool!</em></p>
<p id="line_4244"><em>But hold on, isn’t that what the losing side usually says?</em></p>
<p id="line_4245">“Fine by me! I’ll be counting on you!”</p>
<p id="line_4246">“Just leave it to me. I lost to her when I was just a dragon, so this is a great chance to show off my strength after my growth.”</p>
<p id="line_4247">In spite of how confident he sounded, hadn’t he actually become weaker?</p>
<p id="line_4248"><em>What kind of logic is that you become stronger in your human form than when you are a dragon?</em> Despite internally disparaging him, seeing how motivated he looked, I decided it was better not to tell him. And so I very gladly shoved Veldora onto the battlefield.</p>
<p id="line_4249">Even if he lost, Veldora wouldn’t die anyway. I could rest assured about that.</p>
<p id="line_4250">I turned my head to Leon. “Are you all right, Leon?”</p>
<p id="line_4251"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was observing us, so my eyes didn’t dare stray from her as I spoke to Leon.</p>
<p id="line_4252">“I managed to hold it together, but don’t get careless. She is stronger than I imagined.”</p>
<p id="line_4253">In any case, I healed Leon’s injuries first. His sword had been broken and he himself was covered in wounds. It was a miracle that he made it this far.</p>
<p id="line_4254">It was thanks to the time bought by Leon that I managed to summon Veldora successfully.</p>
<p id="line_4255">“I could tell that from the moment I saw her. Moreover, since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had been on high alert against her, I knew from the start that she wouldn’t be an easy opponent.”</p>
<p id="line_4256">That was the reason why I even used my trump card, Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_4257">“Is this why you called Veldora? I’m not going to ask you how you did it, but it’s definitely encouraging knowing he’s on our side. However, even a ‘True Dragon’ would have a hard time fighting that thing.”</p>
<p id="line_4258">I didn’t need him to tell me twice.</p>
<p id="line_4259">Because this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the one who sealed Veldora away.</p>
<p id="line_4260">“By the way, how are your wounds?”</p>
<p id="line_4261">“Nothing severe. I wasted too much mana trying to prevent my sword from shattering, and thankfully, nothing fatal hit me.”</p>
<p id="line_4262">Coincidentally, Leon’s sword had broken in the end, regardless. In addition, despite how nonchalant Leon put his words, he seemed to be biting his lip, trying to hold himself up.</p>
<p id="line_4263">We didn’t have the extra hands to protect Leon. With how things developed, perhaps I made the right choice in the end.</p>
<p id="line_4264">I didn’t just summon Veldora. There was one more person I called.</p>
<p id="line_4265">“Are you all right, Leon-sama? Long time no see.”</p>
<p id="line_4266">It was Charys.</p>
<p id="line_4267">I ran into a bit of an issue during the summoning. Veldora decided to be stubborn and wanted to bring Charys along, no matter what.</p>
<p id="line_4268">“You are…Ifrit?”</p>
<p id="line_4269">“Indeed. I have now been given the name Charys and am in the service of Veldora-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_4270">“I see, I am glad that you are doing well.”</p>
<p id="line_4271">“I never realized Leon-sama’s true intention was for Shizue Izawa and I to understand each other. It was under the guidance of Veldora-sama that I have now realized how foolish I was.”</p>
<p id="line_4272">“…Is that so?” Leon nodded.</p>
<p id="line_4273">But I honestly doubted whether the two really knew each other. It sounded like they were just casually greeting each other, though it’d be improper to tease them about it given the current situation. They were both so serious. I guess the master and servant were very alike one another.</p>
<p id="line_4274">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, please buy me some time. It’s time for you to witness some of my trump cards,” Leon said.</p>
<p id="line_4275">He could be planning to escape by using me as a distraction, but I believed that Leon wasn’t that kind of person.</p>
<p id="line_4276">I trusted him.</p>
<p id="line_4277">“Understood. I’ll be covering Veldora then. Charys, you shall stand guard here as Leon finishes his preparations.”</p>
<p id="line_4278">“Understood!”</p>
<p id="line_4279">“My apologies, thanks for the assistance.”</p>
<p id="line_4280">And that was settled.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4281">Leon quickly began getting ready. Charys would be in charge of protecting him. The master and servant from the past were working together once again.</p>
<p id="line_4282">I, on the other hand, returned to the battlefield.</p>
<p id="line_4283">The final battle was about to start.</p>

Her life flashed before her eyes—the memories from her childhood to the present.</p>
<p id="line_4287"><em>Right, I remember now. When I was young, my father would spend time playing with me.</em></p>
<p id="line_4288">Since she could only see the present, she had forgotten these important memories.</p>
<p id="line_4289">In the past, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> once had a normal family.</p>
<p id="line_4290">But everything went to hell when <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s father’s company went bankrupt. Had father not strayed to devious ways, mother would not have gone insane. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t have even the slightest intention of imagining just how much her father was suffering.</p>
<p id="line_4291">That was why, even to this day, she still hated him. She lived in hatred, trying to escape from the unfortunate reality that was her family. Unable to forgive her father’s sin, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> focused the blame on him to justify her own actions.</p>
<p id="line_4292">A common trait in humans was that their hearts were weak.</p>
<p id="line_4293">Her father was the same.</p>
<p id="line_4294">Had the family supported each other, perhaps things would have ended differently…</p>
<p id="line_4295"><em>Perhaps it’s laughable for someone like me to act all high and mighty about justice. Perhaps that’s why I pursued the shadow of my father in that man…</em></p>
<p id="line_4296">This sense of justice—regardless of if he denied it—she felt saved by his unbounded good-heartedness.</p>
<p id="line_4297"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s heart had struggled and was about to burst until the one that brought enlightenment to her and put her at ease had undoubtedly—</p>
<p id="line_4298">With that being said, that was just what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought. He would probably be very troubled if she shared this sentiment with him. But sometimes she let herself dwell on this sweet and tempting possibility that perhaps he would accept it.</p>
<p id="line_4299"><em>Wouldn’t that make me just like what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said? After all this time, I still couldn’t forgive myself.</em></p>
<p id="line_4300">Realizing this, she felt rather melancholic.</p>
<p id="line_4301">All her life, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had been burdened by the thought that her actions were unforgivable. Had she not been the person she was, mother would not have felt sad. Even if she were to go back to her original world, no one would celebrate her return.</p>
<p id="line_4302">That’s why she decided to help as many people in this world instead.</p>
<p id="line_4303"><em>I want to save as many people as possible</em>—this thought became <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s driving force.</p>
<p id="line_4304"><em>But I have grown tired. I just want to rest in this dark abyss—</em></p>

<p id="line_4306">«You can’t fall asleep!»</p>

<p id="line_4308"><em>Is that…Chloe?</em></p>
<p id="line_4309">This thought brought <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> back to reality.</p>
<p id="line_4310">No, this was hardly what you’d call reality. Her circumstances were extremely peculiar.</p>
<p id="line_4311">Through a window floating in mid-air, she could see the world outside. Or rather, she did not see through her eyes, but instead could feel it through her heart.</p>
<p id="line_4312">«That’s because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-oneechan is inside me.»</p>
<p id="line_4313"><em>What does that</em>—before <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could ask, she recalled what had happened to her.</p>
<p id="line_4314"><em>R-right, I was struck by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>…but am I not dead?</em></p>
<p id="line_4315">As all her memories slowly came back, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> fell into a state of confusion.

<p id="line_4316">«I will explain everything to you. Just try and stay conscious. Now then, I hope you can synchronize with me.»</p>
<p id="line_4317"><em>Synchronize?</em></p>

<p id="line_4336">However, Chloe remained calm.</p>
<p id="line_4337">“Um—please calm down and listen to me. This is the ancient era.”</p>
<p id="line_4338">‹Huh?›</p>
<p id="line_4339">“Look there, can you see that mountain?”</p>
<p id="line_4340">‹Yeah…eh, could that be?!

<p id="line_4341">It was only natural for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to feel confused.</p>
<p id="line_4342">The only thing she could see was the vague summit of Mount Liora, far in the distance. Since there was nothing in the way, she could see things far away.</p>
<p id="line_4343">Indeed—they were standing in an empty plain. However, to her knowledge, this should be a city. Yet there was nothing there.</p>
<p id="line_4344">She wouldn’t want to consider the other possibility—that the city had been wiped out entirely due to the earth-shattering battle among powerful individuals. However, if that were the case, there wouldn’t be any grass growing here.</p>
<p id="line_4345">—In other words—</p>
<p id="line_4346">“I know that it’s a bit hard to believe, but I am not lying.”</p>
<p id="line_4347">Chloe was right.</p>
<p id="line_4348">In short, this was the holy land—or where the holy land was meant to be in the future. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Chloe had traveled through time to the ancient era before the nation of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had even been born.

<p id="line_4349">With that being the case—</p>

<p id="line_4351">Despite her realization, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> couldn’t help her utterance.</p>

<p id="line_4353">‹Chloe, how can you tell that this is the past?›</p>
<p id="line_4354">Indeed, that was her question.</p>
<p id="line_4355">Even if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was to accept something as ridiculous as time travel, how would Chloe know that this was the past? Wouldn’t there also be a possibility that this was a future where everything was destroyed?</p>
<p id="line_4356">Indeed, not only were there no buildings around, there was no trace of any human occupation either. Since there weren’t any ruins, it was more likely to be the past. But even if that were the case, the ruins could be buried underground, so surely, she could not have concluded that it was the past.</p>
<p id="line_4357">Yet, Chloe had spoken without hesitation.</p>
<p id="line_4358">That was why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was in doubt.</p>
<p id="line_4359">Seeing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s reaction, Chloe replied with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_4360">“It’s simple. Because this isn’t the first time I’ve been here. Every time I lost control over my power, I went back to the past… Since I’ve been to this place before, I remembered.”</p>

She couldn’t say anything out of shock.</p>
<p id="line_4362">As she processed, she began to gradually accept Chloe’s explanation and tried to understand the situation more.</p>
<p id="line_4363">‹Well, I guess you will explain to me in detail what this is all about, right?› <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked, determined.</p>

<p id="line_4365">It <em>appeared</em> that Chloe’s Skill involved time leaping. Emphasis on ‘appeared,’ because Chloe didn’t know this too well herself, either. She mentioned that she couldn’t consciously activate it. At most, she could recall some events from the past.</p>
<p id="line_4366">However, that alone shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p id="line_4367">This ‘past’ was relative to Chloe’s own experiences. And since she had been time leaping over and over, her version of the ‘past’ included events in the linear future of the timeline.</p>
<p id="line_4368">However, she couldn’t seem to recall all her memories clearly…</p>
<p id="line_4369">Human memories could be very ambiguous at times. One may not be able to recall what happened exactly at what time. It was especially so when having over two thousand years’ worth of memories. It was far too difficult to solve the issue.</p>
<p id="line_4370">‹When did you awaken this power?› <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked.</p>
<p id="line_4371">Chloe thought for a bit before answering. “Well, when I was rescued by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei.

<p id="line_4372">Chloe explained that the thing that had taken her as its host was not a spirit, but ‘her power from the future.’ Somehow, her power was self-aware.</p>
<p id="line_4373">“—I think I died in the future. That’s why it seems to repeatedly come back to me at that point in time.”</p>
<p id="line_4374">‹In other words, the ‘Dwelling of the Spirits’ is where your awakening starts?›</p>
<p id="line_4375">“No, that’s not it. At the time, I don’t remember anything. But I will regain my memories the moment I go back in time.”</p>
<p id="line_4376">‹Then you’ve been repeating the same thing over and over?›</p>
<p id="line_4377">“It seems to be the case. I can only remember the details from the last time I was here. Although, there are memories from different lives mixed up in there at times.”</p>

<p id="line_4379">If she had to repeat this over and over again, it would be hell. The human heart wasn’t strong enough to continue fighting for the same result over and over.</p>

<p id="line_4381">Chloe would always travel back to the same era. Perhaps that was the limit of the time leap.</p>

I wanted to be selfish and told him not to go to the battlefield. The Empire was powerful and had many terrifying weapons.

<p id="line_4418">“Umm, yes. The one I gave her.”</p>
<p id="line_4419">This was an event that would happen in the future, yet at the same time, had already taken place in the past. It was a circle of repetition.</p>

<p id="line_4440">Just as Chloe had said, compared to the last timeline, the entire situation had improved.</p>

<p id="line_4442">‹By the way, how come things turned out so differently this time around? What could the cause behind this be…?›</p>
<p id="line_4443">“Hehe, actually, I managed to regain some memories of the future when I was in the ‘Dwelling of the Spirits’ this time.

<p id="line_4444"><em>And then he gave me this</em>—as Chloe said so, she pulled the <em>mask</em> out of nowhere.</p>
<p id="line_4445">‹That’s—I see. You got it this time as well. Then surely you can get back to that direction in the future.›</p>

<p id="line_4447"><em>How clever</em>. Impressed, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began to plan for the future. Since she decided to trust Chloe’s words, she wanted to place her hope in the future.</p>
<p id="line_4448">It was then that Chloe whispered something to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>:</p>

<p id="line_4453">But she felt rather troubled at the same time, thinking of the possibilities…</p>
<p id="line_4454">“Were you just panicking?” At Chloe’s teasing remark, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> firmly changed the topic.</p>
<p id="line_4455">‹Not at all! Never mind that, let’s get to work!›</p>
<p id="line_4456"><em>—Now that I think about it, this kid has over two thousand years of memories after repeating this over and over, right? I must not be deceived by her appearance. I must not treat her like some innocent child…</em></p>

<p id="line_4460">Chloe started off without hesitation.</p>

<p id="line_4462">“Umm, there was a massive battle over there, and I went check it out.”</p>
<p id="line_4463">‹Was it because of Veldora?›</p>
<p id="line_4464">“Uh-huh.

<p id="line_4467">Chloe sure was determined.</p>
<p id="line_4468">She also had a good sense of direction, unlike <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_4507">She could tell if Chloe was lying by analyzing her heart rate and such. Even though Chloe could be lying, she <em>did</em> intimidate those proud soldiers like they were nothing. So there was no reason for her to be a liar.</p>

<p id="line_4515">Overwhelmed by her determination, Chloe could only nod in agreement.</p>

<p id="line_4518">Even though the castle was destroyed by Veldora, due to Chloe’s active involvement, there weren’t many casualties.

<p id="line_4581">“Eh?”</p>
<p id="line_4582">It seemed that it was Chloe’s first time hearing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> so bewildered.

<p id="line_4583">‹I actually fought with Veldora once. At the time…›</p>
<p id="line_4584">The situation then flashed through <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s mind.</p>

<p id="line_4591">—That was about how it went down.

<p id="line_4592">‹…Things happened. I’ll have to give him a good beating to ease my grudge against him.›</p>
<p id="line_4593">Chloe could tell from her tone that she was serious.</p>

<p id="line_4598">In Chloe’s memory of the future, Veldora had spent time playing with her, so she didn’t hate Veldora as much. However, knowing how violent he was in the past, she didn’t feel like defending him that much.</p>
<p id="line_4599">“I don’t really know about your past grievances with him, but please hold back a little. Veldora-san is actually a very nice person!”</p>
<p id="line_4600">So in the end, Chloe let <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> have her own way with him.</p>

<p id="line_4602">“GUWAAAAAAHHHH!”</p>
<p id="line_4603">Hearing Veldora’s furious roar, the beautiful face behind the mask twisted with satisfaction.</p>
<p id="line_4604">And with that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> handed the control of the body back to Chloe.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_4605">Chloe’s time was about to come to an end.</p>
<p id="line_4606">That point between past and present was approaching.</p>
<p id="line_4607">“I haven’t mentioned this to you guys before, but I will be disappearing soon.”</p>
<p id="line_4608">“Chloe, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p id="line_4609">‹What does that mean?›</p>
<p id="line_4610">Chloe had kept it a secret this whole time, but she intended to tell them now. <em>The truth is</em>—</p>
<p id="line_4611"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had half-guessed this.</p>
<p id="line_4612">Soon enough, Leon would appear in the history <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> knew. Since Leon and Chloe were thought to have come to this world together, it would cause a special situation where two of the same person existed in the same era at the same time.</p>
<p id="line_4613">If one were to take the multiverse theory as truth—the idea that new universes, including parallel worlds, emerged one after the other, yet also at the same time—then perhaps having two Chloes at the same time was plausible.</p>
<p id="line_4614">However, if assuming there was only one world—</p>
<p id="line_4615">Chloe’s Unique Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Time Travel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ was an abnormal case, to the extent that the notion of multiple worlds shouldn’t be surprising. In any case, it was still hard to believe for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_4616">It was more logical to think that the world was being remade. Or else, if many versions of themselves existed in many worlds, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Chloe’s efforts would be meaningless in the grand scale of things.</p>
<p id="line_4617"><em>If there is a world that will be saved, then there is another that will perish</em>—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> found this idea hard to accept.</p>
<p id="line_4618">That was why she made up her mind to end Chloe’s endless cycle and save the world. It didn’t matter if she had to be sacrificed in doing so. However, there was also a problem. And that was what Chloe had just said.</p>
<p id="line_4619"><em>By the looks of it, my theory seems to be correct…</em></p>
<p id="line_4620">There really was only one world, and it did not allow the existence of a paradox.</p>
<p id="line_4621"><em>—No, that’s not entirely true. It’s not that it doesn’t allow the existence of a paradox. It just stops the world from collapsing. If there was something strong enough, such as the creation of the mask, then even the paradox couldn’t destroy it, and instead only twist its existence. Otherwise, there’s no way to explain the existence of the peculiar mask.</em></p>
<p id="line_4622">Whilst relieved that her reasoning appeared sound, the thought of what would happen plunged <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s heart into darkness once more. She knew that what would happen next was entirely based on luck; their fate would fall into someone else’s hands.</p>
<p id="line_4623">“—That’s why I won’t have memories from that moment on.

<p id="line_4659"><em>Of course you got cut. You were using your hand to block her sword. I mean, that’s no ordinary sword she is wielding.

And you just ran in recklessly trying to catch the sword by your hand.</em></p>
<p id="line_4660">How unreliable—</p>
<p id="line_4661">As I suspected, this guy had gotten weaker after turning into his human form. And because of how confident he acted before, my disappointment was immeasurable and my day was ruined.</p>
<p id="line_4662">I had been looking forward to Veldora beating <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_4663">But as it turned out, there’s no free lunch in this world after all.</p>
<p id="line_4664">“Seriously, how are you so careless?! Obviously you would have gotten hurt!”</p>
<p id="line_4665">I started crying seeing the pathetic state Veldora was in. This was some grade-A bullshit.</p>
<p id="line_4666">“B-but, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, that sword was even stronger than when we fought last time…”</p>
<p id="line_4667">“So you’re saying the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is using ‘Absolute Severance’? Didn’t you say you’d been hit by it before?”</p>
<p id="line_4668">To be fair, I didn’t know how credible the ‘Absolute’ part was. But I definitely didn’t want to use my ‘Absolute Defense’ to test which one was stronger.</p>
<p id="line_4669">“No, that’s because…I was fine being cut by that…”</p>
<p id="line_4670">With that mutter, Veldora concentrated on evading <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s attacks. He would get cut at times, but fortunately, he seemed to have strength to spare.</p>
<p id="line_4671">No, in fact—</p>
<p id="line_4672">I understood what Veldora meant.</p>
<p id="line_4673">He was saying that in his previous battle with her, he didn’t take nearly as much damage with these same slashes. But the reason why was rather obvious if you thought about it a bit. This was purely the result of different sizes. The size of a slash could be estimated, and even if it could be widened through skill, it, surely, would not have been able to cut through Veldora’s giant draconic body.</p>
<p id="line_4674">However, Veldora was in his human form now. And he was stupid enough to try to use his hands to catch the sword, so of course he would be cut. Even though it would quickly regenerate, compared to his dragon form, it would consume magicule at a much higher rate. Normally speaking, when fighting in human form, it wouldn’t require nearly as much stamina. However, it didn’t seem to be strong enough against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_4675">He was probably too confident in his proud ‘Veldora-Style Killing Arts<sup>TM</sup>’ and tried to recreate the made-up technique of blocking a sword with his hands from manga.</p>
<p id="line_4676">That said, I wasn’t really panicking. This would be a good lesson for Veldora. That’s why I decided to let him continue drawing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s attention completely.</p>
<p id="line_4677">I turned my attention to Leon.</p>
<p id="line_4678">Under Charys’s protection, Leon was conducting a summoning. Even though it hadn’t been that long in reality, it felt like an eternity.</p>
<p id="line_4679">Leon summoned a rapier.</p>

<p id="line_4682">The round, golden shield in his left hand seemed to be legendary-grade.

Leon probably just felt it was better than nothing.</p>
<p id="line_4683">All in all, Leon seemed to be ready.</p>
<p id="line_4684">We could finally start our counterattack—</p>
<p id="line_4685">Or so I thought.

<p id="line_4687">In that instant, as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I crossed eyes, she sent a strong telepathic message to me.</p>
<p id="line_4688">‹Let me explain this for you first. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is another personality of Chloe! <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s soul may be resting inside her too, so you must not kill her!›</p>
<p id="line_4689">…<em>WHAT!</em></p>
<p id="line_4690">Compared to the strength of her ‘Telepathy,’ the message she delivered was far more shocking.</p>
<p id="line_4691"><em>How could you say something so important at a dire time like this so casually?!</em></p>

<p id="line_4694">I didn’t know what to do now that I had been informed of the truth so suddenly.</p>

<p id="line_4696">Now that she mentioned it, they looked quite similar.</p>
<p id="line_4697">But what was the thing about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s soul? I didn’t know what to take from that…</p>
<p id="line_4698"><em>What in the world is happening there?</em></p>
<p id="line_4699">«Report.

<p id="line_4700"><em>And that means?</em></p>
<p id="line_4701">«In other words, individual ‘Chloe <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Aubert" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ likely time-leaped to the past and grew to be the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ in front of you now.»</p>
<p id="line_4702"><em>No way, no no no.</em></p>
<p id="line_4703"><em>Is that even possible?</em></p>
<p id="line_4704">I could just ask <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but she was busy fighting to the death against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. So I couldn’t just have a Q&amp;A. Even her ‘Telepathy’ was only just sent in the nick of time.</p>
<p id="line_4705"><em>Speaking of time leaps…is it like time travel or a time slip? I don’t think she can control it freely, so I suppose it’s more like sliding in and out of time?</em></p>
<p id="line_4706"><em>—Eh, why do I believe all this.</em></p>
<p id="line_4707"><em>No, the thing is—</em></p>
<p id="line_4708">Chloe disappeared in front me before.</p>
<p id="line_4709">«Answer. Assuming the phenomenon occurred at that time was a ‘Time Leap,’ then it is impossible to observe all elements of the event. Without authority to interfere with ‘Time,’ it is naturally unobservable.»</p>
<p id="line_4710"><em>I suppose, after all, even if you know the concept of time, observing time itself is impossible.</em></p>
<p id="line_4711">Actually, hold on. I didn’t have to understand any of this. If I just accepted that it was possible, then so many things suddenly made sense.</p>
<p id="line_4712">When I was trying to help the young Chloe, the ‘thing’ we summoned must have been from the future.

<p id="line_4713">«Correct. This possibility is extremely high.»</p>
<p id="line_4714">I see.</p>
<p id="line_4715">If that were true, it would explain why Ramiris was so panicked at the time.

Sensing that aura, Ramiris would naturally try to stop it.</p>
<p id="line_4716">There was no use worrying about this now.</p>
<p id="line_4717">Chloe had definitely leapt through time, that was for sure.</p>
<p id="line_4718"><em>Then how to explain the situation right now?</em></p>
<p id="line_4719">«Report. The same ‘soul’ cannot exist in two places in the same spacetime. Thus, they reacted to each other, causing one of the two to disappear.

<p id="line_4727">I was surprised. I didn’t expect to gain his trust so easily. He spoke less formally too. I suppose a more casual Leon wasn’t that bad either.</p>
<p id="line_4728">A thanks would have to suffice for now. I then gave my order to Veldora.</p>

<p id="line_4731">But I didn’t even say anything—</p>

<p id="line_5261">Despite his calm and collected appearance, he was actually a bit of an airhead, and the type to step in conversational landmines.</p>
<p id="line_5262">I mean, he valued Chloe so much. He’d been rather attached to her, without showing any signs of leaving. He even claimed that she was the most beautiful girl in the world. He was being indulgent and didn’t even have the decency to be subtle.</p>
<p id="line_5263">“Leon-oniichan, you’ve always been like this. You’re too attached to me! That’s why I always tell you that you won’t get a girlfriend acting like this!”</p>
<p id="line_5264">Chloe was quite harsh on Leon.</p>

<p id="line_5266">By the way, I might have been fooled by his cool and handsome appearance, but Leon was a really unlucky guy. Ramiris also said that Leon used to be a crybaby. <em>Maybe I should treat him better.</em></p>

<p id="line_5268">Surprised, I suddenly remembered. “Chloe! Something this important—“ I paused.</p>

<p id="line_5270">But it turned out that my worries were unnecessary.</p>
<p id="line_5271">“It’s fine! I don’t think anyone is watching us anymore.” Chloe’s declaration assured our safety.</p>
<p id="line_5272">In that moment, Chloe was far more than the young girl she looked to be. Children would eventually grow up to no longer require their parents’ care. While happy at Chloe’s growth, it made me a bit lonely too.</p>
<p id="line_5273">It was then that I realized something.</p>
<p id="line_5274">As of now—‘True <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ Chloe <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Aubert" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had awoken. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Chloe weren’t completely separated.

<p id="line_5276">—No, that’s not true.</p>
<p id="line_5277">It was not some accidental miracle, but instead a certain result of Chloe’s unyielding will. Chloe pushed forward, persevering through her endless cycle of repetition and in the end, managed to overcome all challenges to reach a whole new level. It was Chloe’s undying will that dispelled despair and made this miracle.</p>
<p id="line_5278">At that moment, I admired Chloe from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p id="line_5279">That was why I decided to say this without any pretense: “You really worked hard. I want to learn from you too. I swear to never give up in the face of anything.”</p>
<p id="line_5280">That was my most genuine thought.</p>
<p id="line_5281">“Mmhm!”</p>
<p id="line_5282">Chloe nodded with a bright smile. I swore to never let her lose that smile in the future.</p>
<p id="line_5283">In other words, I couldn’t always be so naive. Now that I knew that there was a force out there trying to kill me, it was only naturally that I would have to come up with a solution.</p>
<p id="line_5284"><em>Am I right?</em></p>
<p id="line_5285">«Correct. A comprehensive solution must be made.»</p>
<p id="line_5286">This incident gave me a very deep realization: if I were to be defeated, it would not just be <em>my</em> problem alone.</p>
<p id="line_5287"><em>No mercy for my enemies</em>—I solidified this resolve in my heart again.</p>
<p id="line_5288">Understanding my enemies’ ideals were indeed important, but it was meaningless if it was at the cost of our sacrifice.</p>

<h1 class="ch-number">Epilogue</h1>
<h1 class="ch-name">To the Promised Land</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_5292">That night, we just exchanged a bit of information with each other. We decided to discuss the details after we had settled down later.</p>
<p id="line_5293">Leon told me about his relationship with Chloe. They were childhood friends that grew up like siblings. He didn’t reveal more information. Chloe probably had forgotten about it too, so it remained a mystery.</p>
<p id="line_5294">Although I wouldn’t consider it to be that big of one.</p>
<p id="line_5295">Leon was always calm, cool, and collected, except when he was with Chloe. The extent to which Leon spoiled Chloe could rival how much <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san spoiled Ramiris. His dedication was on a dangerous level. He might as well have declared, with a straight face, in front of Chloe something like: <em>Let me take a vow and pledge my loyalty to you.</em></p>
<p id="line_5296">That being said, Chloe would probably smile and reject him.</p>
<p id="line_5297">On that note, Chloe seemed able to turn herself into an adult. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s consciousness remained healthy inside her in a relationship similar to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and me. That’s why they could switch control of their body. When engaging in serious combat, I heard that she could merge consciousnesses with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and in doing so, she could restore her original appearance.</p>
<p id="line_5298">She also mentioned that suddenly turning into her adult form would probably cause a panic among the other children. So, she wanted to continue life in her current form.</p>
<p id="line_5299">I found that safer too and told Chloe to do as she wished.</p>

I suspect that he recovered later on as well.”</p>
<p id="line_5302">So serious yet so clumsy.</p>
<p id="line_5303">That’s perhaps the best way to describe <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as a person. The death of his wife Maria made him feel guilty that he was unable to protect the one he loved.</p>
<p id="line_5304">When this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> found his new hope—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, she too suffered defeat after challenging me. Even though I had no evidence, my guess was that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had killed her.</p>
<p id="line_5305">Yet to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, any explanation was meaningless. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s death had a significant impact on him. Perhaps it was the loneliness he felt after losing her that cleared up <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s mind in the end.</p>
<p id="line_5306">There’s nothing more ironic than that.</p>
<p id="line_5307">After his mind returned to normal, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> devised a plan to awaken the ‘True <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ Had he failed, the world would have been devastated in a crisis. Yet <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had made his decision. His resolve was unmatched. That alone, was the only undeniable fact.</p>
<p id="line_5308">A <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t have to be someone of lofty virtue.

Therefore, when he had succumbed to insanity, the consequences afterward were probably greater than if it was anyone else.</p>
<p id="line_5310">Even I could not deny that I was not susceptible to this. What if I were to lose my loved ones? I recalled the time when I had almost lost my companions. The loss almost tore my heart out.</p>
<p id="line_5311">“’How foolish’—I seriously can’t say this about him in good conscience.”</p>
<p id="line_5312">I could relate to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s feelings on some level.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_5313">The next day:</p>
<p id="line_5314">Under the vast blue sky, with the ruins of the Grand Cathedral as the backdrop, our musical exchange concert took place as planned.</p>
<p id="line_5315">In front of the band was a neatly seated crowd as the audience.</p>
<p id="line_5316">The beautiful yet melancholic music resounded through the skies. It was the song to bid farewell to those who had placed their hope in the future—a requiem.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 11/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_5317"><em>I had a dream. A very strange dream. In that dream, I became a very selfish little girl.</em></p>
<p id="line_5318">Maria smiled as she woke up to the sight of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gran" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_5319">“Was it a good dream?”</p>
<p id="line_5320">“Yes, it was very sweet.”</p>
<p id="line_5321">The two smiled at each other.</p>
<p id="line_5322">“How incredible, why didn’t I believe that slime?”</p>
<p id="line_5323">“Umm—that’s a hard question. <em>Because it was a dream</em>—An answer like this sounds a bit unromantic.”</p>
<p id="line_5324">“Ehhh, can’t you answer it seriously?”</p>
<p id="line_5325">“Hahaha, sorry. Just like you said, Maria, things wouldn’t have escalated to this extent had we been able to accept everything and trust each other. But humanity is cowardly. They fear the people who live by rules different from their own and are wary that they might betray them. More problematically, he who does not doubt others is a man of beautiful heart but by no means qualified as a politician. Since being more careful than anyone else is the quality that is required of those who lead…”</p>
<p id="line_5326">Hearing this, Maria bulged her cheeks, seemingly discontent.</p>
<p id="line_5327">“Seriously! Then humans would never really understand each other from their hearts! I don’t like that, don’t like that at all! That’s why I’ve decided to trust him next time.”</p>
<p id="line_5328">“You are talking about what happened in the dream, right?”</p>
<p id="line_5329">“Yes, I am. That is, if I ever have the same dream next time, I will definitely believe in that slime-san. I’m sure we will become very good friends by that time!”</p>
<p id="line_5330">“Is that so? I’m sure you will,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gran" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> agreed gently.</p>
<p id="line_5331">“By the way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gran" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, what dream did you have?” Maria asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gran" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> innocently.</p>

<p id="line_5333"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gran" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had a very long and sorrowful dream.</p>
<p id="line_5334">But in the end, he got to see a ray of hope.</p>
<p id="line_5335">“It was a good dream. Really good.”</p>
<p id="line_5336">“Ahh, that’s great! If you are happy, I am happy!”</p>
<p id="line_5337">“Me too. As long as you are happy, I will be able to overcome whatever hardship I meet.”</p>
<p id="line_5338">“We can spend every day together peacefully. That thought alone brings me joy.”</p>
<p id="line_5339">“Indeed.”</p>
<p id="line_5340">“When our child is born, we will have more family, and we’ll be even happier!”</p>
<p id="line_5341">“Yes, you are absolutely right.” As he finished, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gran" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gently hugged Maria.</p>
<p id="line_5342">They heard beautiful music playing. It was the music telling them to set forth on their journey.</p>
<p id="line_5343">“It’d be improper to keep <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Razul" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> waiting. It’s about time for us to get going.”</p>
<p id="line_5344">“Umm, right. Did you forget anything? We probably won’t get a chance to return here, no?”</p>
<p id="line_5345">“Well, no worries. As long as I have you by my side, I don’t need anything else.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_5346">And so, the two held each other’s hands and started walking.</p>
<p id="line_5347">To the promised land far far away, where everyone was waiting.</p>
<h1 class="afterword" id="afterword">Afterword</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_5348">Sorry for the long wait. I will now give you volume 11.</p>
<p id="line_5349">This volume is almost entirely different from the web novel version. Spoiler alert, the character arcs later on in the story will also differ from the web novel version. That’s why their character settings will be changed as well.</p>

And also because of Editor I-san’s reckless interjection, all the changes were settled as final.</p>
<p id="line_5351">I recall he even threw out a couple stubborn remarks like—</p>
<p id="line_5352">“Don’t you think the little girl Chloe was a bit lonely?”</p>
<p id="line_5353">Something along those lines.</p>
<p id="line_5354">It was then that I began to suspect that Editor I-san is a Lo<b>[redacted]</b>con.

<p id="line_5355">Chloe’s plot was already a pain in the ass, and with I-san’s demands, it really gave me a headache this time. Although I dare to say it ended up making the story more interesting.</p>
