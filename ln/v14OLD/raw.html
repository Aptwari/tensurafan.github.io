With an army of nearly a million men, defeat had been unthinkable. No one doubted that they would accomplish their long cherished dream of conquering the West and establish a completely unified nation under the name of Emperor Rudra. The Great Jura Forest was a daunting obstacle, but now that the evil dragon Veldora had been weakened, there was nothing to fear. It was supposed to be that way.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&hellip;</span><span class="c14">The invasion campaign of the Imperial Army, considered by many to be the most powerful of all time under the reign of His Majesty the Emperor, had finally begun.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least, this was the general impression of the subjects, but no one had expected a tough fight, let alone defeat. None of them could have ever imagined that they would not reach the Western Nations or that their invasion army would be destroyed at the Great Jura Forest. However, the Imperial Army had been annihilated without achieving anything. The unforeseen impediment that was the Jura Tempest Federation would serve as a reminder to these subjects of how vast the world truly was.

People gathered in secret in a luxurious room allocated to the corps commander. Currently present was Yuuki, the room&rsquo;s owner and the head of the Moderate Clown Troupe, followed by Kagali, Laplace, Teare, and Footman. There was also Misha, one of the three heads of Cerberus. Vega was not participating in the meeting as he was on a mission with his Magic Beast Corps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">In the meantime, Laplace and Misha finished their reports. Upon hearing the reports, Yuuki couldn&rsquo;t help but smile bitterly.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">Although he had thought about the situation and made various predictions, the result was still unexpected. It was too overwhelming and much quicker than expected. The results of Rimuru and his men&rsquo;s military victory were so great that it was now necessary to rethink the whole plan. What was most astonishing was the extent to which Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s power had increased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To think&hellip;that they would defeat such a large army so easily. I expected that they would win, but to have zero casualties on Rimuru-san&rsquo;s side is something else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable. That army would have been able to go toe-to-toe with the force of three demon lords at the same time&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nah, compared to the ten great demon lords, the strength of the &lsquo;Octagram&rsquo; is far superior. Even if Guy is a special case, Luminas and Dagruel have been competing for supremacy for a long time, haven&rsquo;t they? Leon&rsquo;s power is well known to you, and even Milim, who was famous for not having any subordinates, has Karion and Frey who were both former demon lords. I think only Ramiris and Dino are the outliers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali refuted Yuuki&rsquo;s words, but as he explained the situation to her, she became convinced. Indeed, the situation was different from the time when Kagali was a demon lord. The assumption went without saying for Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim was now the ruler of the vast territory south of the Great Jura Forest. Luminas and Dagruel had always been very powerful, and their might had never been reduced by the war against the angels. Aside from exceptions like Leon, they were incomparable to the new demon lords when Kagali was a demon lord. Even for the demon lords who had gathered a good number of followers, it depended on their luck whether they could survive or not. The same was true for &lsquo;Curse Lord&rsquo; Kazalim, aka Kagali. That was why he had sought to be wise and form alliances with other demon lords. He had tried everything he could to stay alive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">The &lsquo;Bloody Lord&rsquo;, Roy Valentin, was only a body double, and the god Luminas was actually the demon lord. But even that, Luminas has not been able to win the power struggle with Dagruel. I envied those who have power, unlike us. Karion and Frey are smart. I should have been smarter. Had I done so, I wouldn&rsquo;t have caused everyone so much grief and we wouldn&rsquo;t have lost Clayman&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In retrospect, there was no point in forcing many majin to be under one&rsquo;s command. No matter how many majin you have, that army would be meaningless against those who have a certain level of strength. This was clearly shown by Clayman&rsquo;s failure. What Kagali and her group really should have done was to increase the number of people with whom they could talk frankly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Well, that&rsquo;s all in hindsight now. It&rsquo;s difficult to trust others when we&rsquo;ve been repeatedly deceived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes. If she had not met Yuuki, Kagali would still be resenting the world today.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">No use crying over spilled milk, </span><span class="c14">Kagali changed gears and put her regrets behind her.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The conversation continued without regard for Kagali&rsquo;s internal feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, I guess you had a tough time, Laplace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tellin&rsquo; me&hellip; I had a hell of a time once again.&rdquo; Laplace agreed, looking exhausted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha. You were fighting for about ten days?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, that Treyni girl has become crazy strong. If I&rsquo;d lost focus for a second, much alone let down my guard, I woulda been done for. What&rsquo;s more, we fought in the woods. The odds were against me, so I think I did my best there, no?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace&rsquo;s gripes went on for a long time. He had brought that on himself for acting so suspicious, but for once, he seemed to have had a bit of an opinion. Yuuki soothed Laplace for a moment and continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At any rate, they believed you in the end, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They tied me up so tight that I couldn&rsquo;t even resist. The executives&rsquo; of Demon Lord Rimuru were watchin&rsquo; me, and I can&rsquo;t say that they believed me after goin&rsquo; to that length.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so, Laplace deserved credit for being able to negotiate and bring back the information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised they let you go in one piece.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I heard that Demon Lord Guy gave him the slip. Rather than trustin&rsquo; the boss, he was trying to take advantage of the situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they had remained explicitly hostile, there was no way that the captured Laplace would have been released. Before that, Laplace would never have gotten involved. Laplace finished his complaints. Yuuki was relieved, but he couldn&rsquo;t relax just yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I had the same feeling as Laplace-dono. This time was really exhausting. My role was to agitate the commander of Caligurio&rsquo;s army and prolong the war. I fully understood that, but in the middle of the war, I seriously offered to withdraw. When it was rejected, I even thought of running away, even if I had to kill that man.&rdquo; Misha continued bitterly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But by the time she had advised them of this, it was too late. Misha was only able to escape because Yuuki had been in a cooperative relationship with Rimuru. If not for that, she would have been killed by Diablo by now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, we were lucky. I&rsquo;m glad Rimuru-san is a man of his word.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, that Rimuru slime is crazy. From what I remember, there should have been some fierce fighters among those belonging to the Armored Corps who could rival the Demon Lords.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There were.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, there were. They were taken care of by his subordinates before Demon Lord Rimuru came out, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha explained in dismay that even the dreaded demon peer had joined Rimuru&rsquo;s crew. Misha herself was not very realistic in her explanation. How could such a supreme-level demon, who is unbounded by anything, obey a single demon lord?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What shocked me was that two &lsquo;Single Digits&rsquo; were killed in front of my eyes as if they were guinea pigs. Frankly speaking, it was foolish to challenge such a monster.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he concluded his speech, everyone was in disbelief. Yuuki switched the topic to change the mood that was about to become too heavy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bernie and Jiwu&rsquo;s identities were also a surprise. It was a frustrating experience for me to see that I have been dancing in the palm of Damrada&rsquo;s hand up until now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those were Yuuki&rsquo;s true feelings. This confirmation that Damrada was a traitor came as a shock to Yuuki and his friends. Damrada had been Yuuki&rsquo;s confidant, whom he had trusted for many years. Damrada was a major figure in the core of Yuuki&rsquo;s group. He had trusted Damrada so much that he entrusted him with the secret society Cerberus as a foothold in the Empire. The betrayal of such a person forced them to rethink their entire strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two of the strongest forces of the Empire were attached to Masayuki, who had been regarded as a pawn. This fact also proved Damrada&rsquo;s foresight. Damrada must have influenced Yuuki&rsquo;s actions for a higher vision than Yuuki&rsquo;s. Now that Yuuki realized this, his pride was in tatters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I think Clayman&rsquo;s outburst may have been Damrada&rsquo;s involvement as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali, who had been pondering over the situation, also said as such. Yuuki nodded his head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t deny that. It&rsquo;s a little strange now that I think about it, that all our plans have failed. But I don&rsquo;t think Damrada would have benefited from that. Our power has grown because of Damrada&rsquo;s cooperation. If he wanted to take away our power, he should not have given it to us in the first place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is the question. Damrada seemed to be fascinated with Yuuki-sama. It did not look like an act, and his loyalty seemed genuine. We have completed many projects with his help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As a colleague, I can say that Damrada-dono truly worked for the organization. His achievements were great and his loyalty to the boss was genuine. However, it is also true that the man has a ruthless and cold-hearted side. His rationalistic side can be seen from the fact that he is in charge of Gold. Therefore, he might have betrayed the boss for some reason.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say for sure that there is no such thing.&rsquo; Misha said, however, Yuuki shook his head and replied to Misha.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is no doubt that Damrada betrayed us. But it is not clear if he truly meant it or not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki smiled bitterly while muttering, &lsquo;or perhaps it was genuine betrayal&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess I agree with the boss. If it was all an act, Damrada&rsquo;s behavior would not make any sense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali also seemed to have come to the same conclusion as Yuuki. As soon as she said so, she started to express her opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, let me explain. Master Gadra reported to us, and we realized Damrada&rsquo;s betrayal. The place where Gadra was killed was Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s castle, and standing in front of him was Lieutenant Kondou, the man who lurks in the shadows of the Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Emperor&rsquo;s castle&hellip; I see. So Damrada had the status to get access in there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nodding at Misha&rsquo;s words, Yuuki added more information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Incidentally, from the information you brought back, I have also figured out the identity of Damrada. There are probably only a few people, other than the Emperor, who can order a &lsquo;Single Digit&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone nodded in agreement with Yuuki&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. That&rsquo;s right. When you think about it, it&rsquo;s quite natural.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Damrada did not betray us, but only followed the Emperor&rsquo;s order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe he didn&rsquo;t mean it, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter now, does it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They may or may not have been enemies of Yuuki&rsquo;s group from the beginning. But in this case, all that mattered was the result that Damrada was a traitor. And it was Laplace&rsquo;s side that was not satisfied with the betrayal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Surely, the boss must be right. However, if there is the possibility that Damrada manipulated Clayman, then shouldn&rsquo;t he be made to pay for it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, right! Let&rsquo;s go over there and kill him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ho-ho-ho. Trust comes first. We don&rsquo;t tolerate traitors!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace aloofly suggested a purge. Teare and Footman agreed. However, Yuuki stopped them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just wait. Damrada is really a high ranking member of the Imperial Guardians. You can be sure that he is more dangerous than a normal demon lord. I doubt you can beat him, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Yeah, right. I hate to admit it, but I don&rsquo;t think even I could have beaten Master Gadra in my prime. If Damrada could kill Master Gadra with a single blow, even if it was a surprise attack, we should consider Damrada&rsquo;s ability to be quite strong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;Besides</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">I think there is a hidden message in Damrada&rsquo;s actions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a short pondering, Yuuki spoke up. Then, with a hypothetical story in mind, he began to express his thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damrada is a cautious man. He knows us well, and he has detailed information about Demon Lord Rimuru. A man like that would have known about the &lsquo;Resurrection Bracelet&rsquo; as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I mean, I think Damrada was aware of the possibility of Gadra coming back to life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But then&hellip;no way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha also came up with the possibility that he did not kill Gadra but rather let him go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The last person Gadra confronted was the &lsquo;information eating monster&rsquo;, right? If Gadra had been left alive, he would have fallen into the hands of Lieutenant Kondou. If that had happened, all the information Gadra knew would have been extracted by any means possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that had happened, all of our purposes would have been revealed, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe, yeah. But you know, there&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t understand. Gadra&rsquo;s silence kept Rimuru-san&rsquo;s information from leaking out. And as a result, the Empire suffered a major blow. I don&rsquo;t think Damrada caused the damage to the Empire just out of a sense of duty to us&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki laughed, unable to explain that point. Kagali again made a comment on this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damrada&rsquo;s loyalty is more towards Emperor Rudra than to Yuuki-sama. There is no doubt about this. At the same time, he thinks of us as his friends. No, no. What if he was thinking that we could be of use to him, or that we could play some role?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm-hmm, go on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is also possible that the defeat of the Imperial Army was in accordance with Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s wishes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s absurd.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha and Laplace immediately denied it, but Yuuki examined their opinions with amusement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What purpose does Damrada have in deriving this possibility?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that simple. Mass death is an essential part of the great ritual. Just as the awakening of a demon lord requires a lot of souls, didn&rsquo;t Damrada and Emperor Rudra also sacrifice the Imperial Army itself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible. Go on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If so, it is no wonder that he interfered with Lt. Kondou, who was determined to win. At the same time, the meaning of his missing us is also vaguely apparent&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra had been going to warn the Emperor. This was interrupted by Damrada. If Gadra&rsquo;s information had reached Kondou&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The damage to the Imperial Army would not have been so great. Even before that, Rimuru&rsquo;s maneuvers would have taken a different form. A man of Damrada&rsquo;s stature could not have been unaware of this, and his actions must have been intentional. In that case, what was the purpose?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A touchstone, perhaps?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali smiled at Yuuki&rsquo;s answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Numerous sacrifices are tolerated in order to create a true strongman. And they were going to use us as pawns to create the strong, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Or perhaps they wanted to bring us in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Clayman was not the kind of guy who would take orders from anyone but me and Kagali.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm-hmm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If they let Clayman go out of control like that, it seems to me that they must have used some kind of subterfuge.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess so. For example, brainwashing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki nodded to Kagali&rsquo;s point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s possible that he was &lsquo;thought induced&rsquo; even if it wasn&rsquo;t that powerful. They may have used items like we did, or they may have a hidden Skill like Mariabell, which is a domination type Skill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing the reasoning, all of them had a hard look on their faces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone nodded at Misha&rsquo;s words. Yuuki looked around the group and then spoke with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t worry. That kind of power is ineffective against me. I&rsquo;m going to check each of you a little bit now, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They all agreed without issue. To deny it here would be to confess to being manipulated. No one could refuse Yuuki&rsquo;s offer to prove their innocence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Apparently, no one has been brainwashed. Well, I would have thought that it would be fine if no one acted alone, since we would have noticed immediately if something was wrong with their behavior.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you say so, I was in danger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace said after getting up from his seat and spinning around. However, Yuuki and Kagali denied it with perfect breath.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, no, you&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You&rsquo;re the only one who doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Laplace returned to his seat sulkily and began to complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What the hell? You should be more concerned about me, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace&rsquo;s antics blew away the heavy air out of the room. Laughter echoed, and everyone&rsquo;s thoughts switched. Thankful for this, Yuuki opened his mouth as if he was trying to rearrange the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, let&rsquo;s leave aside what Damrada is thinking. The question is, what should we do now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I agree. I would like to ask Damrada how much of what we are up to has been leaked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, hey, hey! He knows what we&rsquo;re up to, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told Damrada all about my plans. It&rsquo;s not a question of being exposed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, shouldn&rsquo;t we get out of here as soon as possible?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, you know, I can&rsquo;t say that for sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Currently, Yuuki&rsquo;s faction was based in the Empire. There were a few hideouts in the Western Nations, but they were few and far between. They could not hide there, nor could they easily find a new hiding place. Above all, there was too little time and preparation to let all of the bottom members escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At the very least, it is impossible for me to run Cerberus by myself. I had to rely heavily on Damrada&rsquo;s processing power, and I don&rsquo;t even know who his subordinates are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other boss, Vega, was a man whose only real talent was violence. He could not be expected to do much in the way of management of the organization. Misha&rsquo;s statement had been based on this fact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;I know. Cerberus is going to lose its head. Damrada&rsquo;s men are all gone, but the problem is the Mixed Corps. I don&rsquo;t want to give up this force</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">or rather, I don&rsquo;t want to lose all my bases.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You could cut your losses, but in this case, the losses were too great. There was no place in the world that would accept a hundred thousand men. They would have to leave their men behind, but if they did so, those who remained would be purged for sure. In the first place, Damrada did not seem to intend to tell the secrets of Yuuki&rsquo;s group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There are several reasons why Damrada might have kept Gadra&rsquo;s mouth shut, one of them being to keep Kondou from getting information about us. Perhaps Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s near-guard are not ironclad. Our plan of a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in the capital, I think Damrada would like us to succeed in this, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what his intention is, but if Damrada wanted to hide us, it would be the only way to achieve his goal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki and Kagali exchanged their opinions as if anticipating each other&rsquo;s thoughts. The rest of the group looked at them in puzzlement. Then, perhaps unable to hold back any longer, Laplace interrupted them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, no, wait a minute. You know that he let Gadra go on purpose, but that&rsquo;s just his guess, right? If so, it&rsquo;s just a misunderstanding, and it&rsquo;s more likely that Kondou and Damrada are good friends, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone nodded their heads in agreement, but Yuuki answered confidently, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen to me, okay? Our coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat was also the result of our deal with Demon Lord Guy. Damrada knows that. I guess he thought it was better to create chaos in the capital to deceive Guy&rsquo;s eyes than to interfere with our plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s one way of thinking about it&hellip;or is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hohoho.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Teare and Footman were already having trouble following the conversation. They had started to play with a cue ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How could the Emperor&rsquo;s inner circle allow such chaos in the capital?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha was trying to formulate her own ideas, but failed to see Yuuki and Kagali&rsquo;s point of view. In a way, this was just a normal reaction. After all, Yuuki and his colleagues&rsquo; mindset was only for those who had absolute rationality and were willing to make any sacrifices for the sake of the goal. Moreover, it was a madness that even Misha could not understand, because it pushed Yuuki&rsquo;s self-interest to the maximum, and it seemed to be full of contradictions from other people&rsquo;s point of view. It was absurd to ask one to understand it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Misha, it&rsquo;s not that difficult. What is important is the point of view of who Damrada is wary of as his enemies. Damrada considers not Yuuki-sama or Demon Lord Rimuru, but Demon Lord Guy Crimson as his enemy from the beginning to the end. Once you get to that point, you can understand why they tolerate us running amok in the capital.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kondou is different. He is hostile not only to Guy, but to all those who would take revenge on the Emperor. He serves Emperor Rudra from a completely different point of view than Damrada.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki concluded that this is why there are conflicts. And Kagali also confirmed it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh well. If the boss and Kagali-sama say so, I&rsquo;ll just believe them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace was unenthusiastic in his assurances. Teare and Footman nodded in agreement. Misha then asked a key question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Yuuki-sama, what are your plans for the future? If Damrada turns out to be an enemy, we can&rsquo;t trust him, regardless of his true intentions, which is only natural. So, shall we cancel the coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat and go on a forced escape? Fortunately, 60 percent of the Mixed Corps is now engaged in the blockade of the Dwarven Kingdom&rsquo;s East city. If I can provide as much support as I can, along with the forces remaining in the capital, it will be no problem for me to take down the provincial cities. If we use that as our base&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The disgruntled, annexed nations of the Empire can rise up and form a great anti-imperial coalition?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, yes. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be the best strategy to secure our forces and have the best chance of winning the war?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not bad. There are plenty of regions oppressed by the imperial aristocracy, if you look hard enough. In such places, we can call ourselves the Liberation Army instead of the Rebel Army.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Unfortunately, the proposal is rejected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha tried to ask why, but it never came to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The only way for us to survive is to make a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat. Isn&rsquo;t that right, Damrada?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki said so before Misha could open her mouth. Before Misha could understand what Yuuki meant, the clowns in the room were prepared to fight. Then, the closed door opened and a man entered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good answer, Boss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man was Damrada. He was dressed as a merchant, as usual. But his presence was that of a soldier, as if he had no intention of hiding it. The air in the room became tense. Damrada&rsquo;s quiet voice stopped Laplace from making a sudden move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it. This building is already surrounded by my men.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki, who had been observing the situation, relaxed his shoulders and sank down on the sofa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you have time to talk? If so, why don&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But Boss, there&rsquo;s no time now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s fine. You, too. Just stay in your seat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After urging a disgruntled Laplace to sit down as well, Yuuki looked at Damrada with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what are you after?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought the boss might have misunderstood me. I came here to explain that I have my own reasons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With this reply, Damrada took his seat as indicated. Laplace and the others couldn&rsquo;t help but snicker at his determined appearance. And then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki and Damrada begin their question-and-answer session, leaving the others behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Difficult circumstances, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I really want you to succeed in the coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you let Gadra go too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukuku, so he&rsquo;s safe after all. I took a gamble on that one, but I thought he would survive, considering how cautious he was.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The purpose was to keep Kondou from getting the information, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought you were loyal to the Emperor?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I swore an oath, yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you have, huh? And now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you many times, and you may not believe me, but my allegiance is to the boss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t trust you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both of them laughed and fought a battle of tongues.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Armored Corps has been destroyed by Gadra&rsquo;s information. Furthermore, the Magic Beast Corps has now left the capital. Even if the situation of the Armored Corps is reported, it will take time for them to come back. At present, the forces defending the capital are greatly reduced. The time is now, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think so. It&rsquo;s so convenient for us that it&rsquo;s almost as if we&rsquo;re being set up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We&rsquo;ve spent years setting this up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damrada, you&rsquo;re&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am, boss. I live to defeat His Majesty Rudra. It&rsquo;s the only way to save him. The best way to do that is to have you take the kingdom. I haven&rsquo;t changed my mind, and I have arranged the situation. All that remains is for you to decide.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki sniffed in a disinterested manner. Everything was going according to Damrada&rsquo;s plan, and he was really not happy about it. However, rejecting him was not an option either. Damrada was right, and the situation could not be more perfect. The only question was whether he should trust Damrada or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let me ask you one thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why did you discard Clayman without consulting me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki and the Moderate Clown Troupe had sworn to each other that they would never betray each other. They were the few people in this world who could be trusted. Clayman, who was one of them, had also been a dear friend to Yuuki. Kagali, Laplace, Teare, and Footman also changed their mindset when they heard Yuuki&rsquo;s question. They focused their eyes on Damrada and glared at him as if they would not tolerate any deception. In the midst of such a deadly atmosphere, Damrada answered calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am not involved in the Clayman case. I have an idea of who did it, but I never expected him to resort to such measures.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a moment of silence until it was broken by Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it Tatsuya Kondou?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You seem to know a lot about Kondou. It seems that you have a lot of secrets, and it&rsquo;s a little too much to ask us to trust you, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki stated his claim to Damrada who was silent. Damrada listened to him with a distressed expression on his face. After he finished listening without making any rebuttal, he replied with a few words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I cannot answer all of your questions because it is forbidden. I can only say that I do not know all of Kondou&rsquo;s capabilities. Nevertheless, I ask you to believe me. To save his Majesty Rudra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Damrada spoke those words, the clowns&rsquo; cold stares penetrated him. Everyone had a look of distrust on their faces. The same was true for Yuuki. However, the current situation was not optimistic, even for Yuuki and his friends. Damrada&rsquo;s men were waiting outside the building, and they could not ignore the presence of Damrada&rsquo;s men from outside the room. Damrada must have brought with him some of the most powerful Imperial Knights. It was difficult for even Yuuki and the others to break through such an encirclement and escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">I can manage on my own, but I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll all make it. In that case, one of the options is to take the proposal at this moment&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki calculated. Then he suddenly noticed Damrada&rsquo;s eyes staring straight at him without wavering. His eyes had not changed since they had met. Yuuki closed his eyes and began to think back. Since the time they met, Damrada had been fearless and impudent, accepting any kind of request as long as it was paid in Gold. Yet, he was a man full of contradictions, willing to invest his money for the sake of his friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I am willing to make any sacrifice for the sake of those I believe in.&rsquo; Damrada once said. He wondered who was reflected in Damrada&rsquo;s eyes at that time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">It wasn&rsquo;t me. But even so, I liked those eyes&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He called Yuuki &lsquo;boss&rsquo; and pledged his loyalty to him. Damrada, however, still had a somewhat untrustworthy side to him. Thinking back on it now, he must have felt lonely. Realizing this, Yuuki opened his eyes and looked at Damrada.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is a lie in your words. You swore loyalty to Emperor Rudra long before you were loyal to me. That hasn&rsquo;t changed. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu, I&rsquo;m no match for you, boss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That murmur was an affirmation. On the contrary, it motivated Yuuki to trust the man named Damrada.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay. Instead of fighting you guys here, let&rsquo;s make the coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat a success!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one expressed dissatisfaction with Yuuki&rsquo;s decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a choice. If Yuuki-sama so decides, then we will obey.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess so. Damrada-san, if you betray us, we&rsquo;ll make it right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you too, Laplace!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ho-ho-ho. Don&rsquo;t forget about me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this moment, the clowns made their decision. They decided to trust their boss, Yuuki. There was a bond of camaraderie. Damrada was among them.</span></p><p class="c17" id="h.30j0zll"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image21.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c19" id="h.ehs4ij5ouaq6"><span class="c10">Chapter 1</span></h2><p class="c35"><span class="c20 c14">Rewards and Evolutions</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c14">It was the day after the revival of almost 700,000 imperial soldiers.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">At the Colosseum, the men who had played an active role in the defense were all lined up. The bleachers were filled with the last of the soldiers. Today was a victory party. Although the war against the Empire was still ongoing, it was planned as a necessary morale booster. Bacchus, who had been sent by the Holy Knight Order, and the &lsquo;Surmounters&rsquo; under Luminas were also present. They were killed by Jiwu, but fortunately they had been in the labyrinth. They were revived and the apologies were accepted. Although they were unanimous in saying that it was only due to inexperience, it still happened in our country, and formality is important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, I was glad that the damage was minimal. We were planning to serve delicious food in the latter half of the party, so I hoped people would enjoy it to their heart&rsquo;s content. In the guest of honor&rsquo;s seats, there were guests from foreign countries. Not only Alvis who participated in the defense as a reinforcement, but also Phobio and the two members of the &lsquo;Two Wings&rsquo; arrived later with the elite contingent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milim-sama was worried and restless, so Frey-sama sent us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, as I said, it was not necessary. We were sure that Rimuru-sama would be the definitive winner.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucia with blonde hair and Claire with silver hair spoke to me in overlapping beautiful voices. I feel like I made Milim worried, but I&rsquo;m sure she will be relieved when I tell her about this victory. The town is safe thanks to Veldora and Ramiris, and we should be able to return to our normal lives soon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;I am the liaison. I was sent here just in case the Magic Communication had gone down. And</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">no, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m being rude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Phobio said he was planning to come back immediately to send reinforcements in case we were defeated. Considering the possibility that the magicules&rsquo; force field would be disturbed and magic could not be used, Phobio, who was the fastest, was selected.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">He was about to say something after that, but stopped halfway. I was concerned about the way he looked at Alvis, but I decided to ignore it, assuming that he had already finished his business. I thanked the three of them and showed them to the distinguished guests&rsquo; table.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, there was another group. There was also a guest of honor from Dwargon. There was Jaine, an old lady who was the top archwizard in Dwargon. Commander of the Pegasus Knights, Dolph-san was also there as a guard. This one was mainly here to complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t use the forbidden spells in the Great Jura Forest,&rsquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">More than that, she was furious with me, her eyes changing as she asked me why I had a &lsquo;primordial&rsquo; with me. To be honest, I feel sorry about that too. But it can&rsquo;t be helped. I was already there before I could realize it, and it was an irresistible force majeure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is not a matter of force majeure! I&rsquo;ve never been so surprised and astonished in all the years I&rsquo;ve lived!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All I could do was apologize. Anyway, I tried to quiet her down, explained things to her and got her in a good mood, and somehow or other, she agreed. I really wanted Jaine-san to go home, but we had to have a meeting in the future. Actually, that was the purpose of this visit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In front of the eastern city of Dwargon, 60,000 troops under Yuuki&rsquo;s command were still deployed. Since they have been told that we are in a tentative alliance with Yuuki, war has not broken out and tensions have remained high. However, we can&rsquo;t just leave things as they are. I wanted to discuss with Yuuki about the future plan. I had released the captured Laplace and entrusted him with a message from me. Now we were waiting for Yuuki to contact us. So, Jaine-san and Dolph-san were also invited to the guest of honor&rsquo;s table. They were invited to observe the victory celebration.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, the victory celebration began with foreign guests watching the event. I was on the podium, which was one step higher than the others. I was sitting on a chair there, in my slime form. Behind me, Rigurd and Rigur stood side by side. With these two men at the top, the civil servants stood on either side of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="LET THE CELEBRATIONS BEGIN" src="images/image22.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Among those lined up below us were the Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten, whose faces were not usually seen. It was only natural, since they were the stars of the day. Normally, they were the bosses of the labyrinth, so it was not good for them to show their faces. But not today. It was because the townspeople and the adventurers who made up the volunteer soldiers were not invited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First to appear was Shuna, standing beside me. She prefaced her speech with my words and then gave her speech of consolation to the crowd. It was a great speech, but I actually didn&rsquo;t come up with it. It was all Shuna. Shuna is a better secretary than the first secretary or the second secretary. As I am not good at giving speeches, she is very helpful to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion is not good at giving speeches, and the thought of Diablo doing it is unsettling&mdash;the praises he&rsquo;d give for me alone would last until the celebration was already over. Grateful to Shuna for being here, I began to think about the next steps. In this victory celebration, I was going to reward the others as well as announce their achievements. In other words, I was going to test the awakening of my subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Wisdom King Raphael-san, by giving my subordinates 100,000 souls, they will be awakened and evolve to be as strong as a &lsquo;True Demon Lord&rsquo;. Only those who qualify are eligible, but surprisingly there were twelve of them. They were Ranga, Benimaru, Shion, Gabil, Geld, Diablo, Testarossa, Ultima, Carrera, Kumara, Zegion, and Adalmann. It seems that they needed to have a soul connection with me and also possess the &lsquo;Demon Lord Seed&rsquo;. Adalmann was the one I was interested in. In his case, I did not name him, so why did he qualify for evolution?</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. Individual Adalmann&rsquo;s faith has broken through a certain threshold and now the connection with the Master is established!&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Oh, I taught Adalmann the &lsquo;secrets of faith and grace&rsquo; that I had learned from Luminas. Thanks to that, he got a connection as good as a given name. That&rsquo;s great, Adalmann. He seems to have a lot of faith in himself to get the qualification by himself.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">It&rsquo;s a little bit awkward for me to be the target of that faith, but I admire him for that. Adalmann&rsquo;s case made sense to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next question is, how many people can I evolve? I counted and found that the number of souls I had in my stock was about a little more than a million. The secret of this is that I have Wisdom King Raphael-san.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Proposal. Individual differences were confirmed in the souls obtained. Do you want to reconstitute uniformly? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">YES/NO&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When asked to answer, I said &lsquo;YES&rsquo; without even understanding what it meant. Then, the number of souls swelled up to more than a million. I had returned a number of energies back to the Imperial officers who were brought back to life. Therefore, I thought that the number would be a little smaller, but the result was the opposite. There were a large number of awakened people like Calgurio, and a large number of powerful people who had attacked the labyrinth. They had more energy than usual, and they took a lot of energy from Jiwu and Bernie who had the Ultimate Skill, even if it was borrowed. It may be that each individual had the soul energy of dozens to tens of thousands of people. For this reason, ten people could be awakened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there were some concerns in trying this out. The first was the leakage of information. Was it safe to do such a showy act in front of guests such as Alvis and Jaine? However, I decided to trust them on this issue. Not because of our alliance, but because I thought they would find out anyway. It is impossible to fool Milim, and King Gazel trusted me during that time with Diablo. Even if Jaine-san was very angry with me, this was nothing now that everything with the labyrinth was known. In time, there would be unnatural rumors about the strength of the bosses from the labyrinth group. Those present thought that there was no point in keeping it a secret.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second concern was that I was not exactly sure what was going to happen. Since this was the first time for me to attempt the evolution of awakening, there was a possibility that something unexpected would happen. Therefore, I had the entire Colosseum isolated by Ramiris&rsquo; ability. This would prevent the damage from spreading to the outside. Besides, it would also maintain confidentiality, so it was a two birds with one stone solution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The last concern was the evolutionary Harvest Festival that would occur like when I awakened as a demon lord. In my case, I fell into a low-level active state (sleep mode) and was unconscious for three days. In a similar situation, the main executives of our group would fall asleep during this time of war. I was worried that something might happen to them, since they would not be able to do anything for two or three days.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although I was a little worried about this, I thought it would not be a problem either. There was no Imperial Army now. Calgurio and the others had told me that there was no immediate strength left in the Armored Corps. Of course, there couldn&rsquo;t be any left since we had killed all 940,000 of their generals. Only the Magic Beast Corps and Mixed Corps remained on the Imperial side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Mixed Corps led by Yuuki was in an alliance of sorts, and the Magic Beast Corps was being carried by the &lsquo;Air Assault Division&rsquo;, the tiger cubs of the Armored Corps, and was heading off in a different direction. Since my &lsquo;Argus&rsquo; is able to track the movement of the airship, I calculated that it would take more than three days for them to reach my country even if it suddenly changed its direction of movement from that point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The normal speed of the Argus was about 400 kilometers per hour on average. It is said that the maximum combat speed would exceed the speed of sound, but mana depletion would be too great and it would last only for a short time. In the first place, it is doubtful if it is even possible to fly such a long distance continuously. The speeds of ships and trains are incomparable, but the sky has its own threats. There are points where air currents swirl violently, points where magicule is disrupted and magic cannot be used at all, and so on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is said that there are also zones where troublesome sky monsters dwell, and it is necessary to think of safe air routes instead of straight ones. In this world, just having a means to travel at the speed of sound is a threat, but it is not as advantageous as one might think. It seemed to me that there was no need for us to be alarmed. The only thing that remained was the possibility of the Imperial Guardians making a move&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, we had won hands down, but only because we had the advantage of the labyrinth. I was able to deal with the situation calmly because I could come back to life even if I died. I would have been able to handle those near guard knights. Regardless, Benimaru would have been able to win. But what about Shion and Ranga? Gabil and Geld might have been in danger too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If so, we should be able to deal with them as soon as possible. Even if we unexpectedly encounter a strong enemy, we should be able to at least buy time. The connection between our souls will be established as &lsquo;Soul Corridor&rsquo;, and it seems that the connection with me will be rock solid as well. With this, the &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; will be connected in any situation. They will be able to contact me as soon as they encounter an enemy, and then we will be able to flank each other and take the enemy out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wanted to awaken everyone now in case of an emergency. I wanted to be prepared for anything. All in all, now was the right time to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let&rsquo;s get started right away. The first person I wanted to nominate was, of course, Benimaru. As the Army General, he had done an excellent job in commanding the entire army. He seemed to be dissatisfied with Testarossa and the demon girls&rsquo; performance, but yes, it was a kind of accident. It was not Benimaru&rsquo;s fault, nor mine! In the end, it was all right, and I can say that it was a great job done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna finished her speech and called up Benimaru. In response, Benimaru stepped forward. Then he knelt down in front of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right! Well, Benimaru-kun, I&rsquo;m going to reward you right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can you stop with the &lsquo;-kun&rsquo;? You&rsquo;re definitely&mdash;you&rsquo;re up to something again, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t understand. I haven&rsquo;t even done anything yet, and he&rsquo;s seeing right through me. This awakening evolution was actually supposed to be a surprise. I thought that if I told him about it, he would definitely oppose it, so I decided to do it without telling him. Shuna was reading out Benimaru&rsquo;s achievements. Meanwhile, the conversation between Benimaru and me was still going on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, I got a lot of souls in this war. It seems that Testarossa and the others were offering their souls to me. And, if I use it, I can awaken those who are connected to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t I heard about that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh? Because I&rsquo;m just saying it now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru and I were staring at each other, wide-eyed. It&rsquo;s because I think he would have objected if I had told him. Benimaru is more serious than I thought, and he seems to want to be strong only by himself. When I evolved into a demon lord, he seemed to have some thoughts about it. I think Diablo and Shion would have been happy to accept this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what do you mean by awakening?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s a good question. In my case, my magicules and mana increased more than tenfold, and all the monsters in the soul lineage have been given a gift. I didn&rsquo;t know what his growth rate would be, but I was sure it would be a big increase in power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, to put it simply, I evolved when I became a demon lord, didn&rsquo;t I? You can think of it as the same phenomenon, the Harvest Festival to become a demon lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Does that mean that not only me, but also my subordinates will be affected?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think maybe they will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was unclear to what extent this would affect the &lsquo;Kurenai&rsquo;, but at the very least, gifts would be distributed to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, no&hellip;this is so important, but you just said it out of the blue without any consultation&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, wait, hold on. That may be so, but this is not the time for questions and answers. Now that we don&rsquo;t know how strong the enemy is, it&rsquo;s imperative that we strengthen our forces, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s true, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru closed his eyes in distress. Then he opened his eyes, looked at me, and sighed deeply. He appeared to have made up his mind. Or maybe he just gave up, but it didn&rsquo;t make much difference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m not the only one you&rsquo;re awakening, am I? I think it&rsquo;s dangerous to lose so much battle strength at this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Only twelve are qualified to awaken, and currently only nine can be awakened. I am going to leave Testarossa and the others as escorts, I have decided that a few days will not be a problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. We have the labyrinth, so I guess it&rsquo;s not a problem if we just need to stall for time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru agreed with my explanation. The remaining question was about the possibility of someone going out of control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, there is one point of concern.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are stronger now than you were when I evolved. The rate of growth from awakening is unknown, so you could become stronger than I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that case, the &lsquo;Food Chain&rsquo; of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; might give me some feedback. Still, there was a possibility that he would become stronger than I am. I mean, Diablo and the others were definitely going to be stronger than me. I don&rsquo;t think Benimaru and the others will betray me, but I can&rsquo;t deny the possibility that they will be swayed by their power and go out of control. I think they will probably be fine, and the Isolation space was designed for in case they run out of control, but it was true that I had such a concern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you really want to force our awakening, even with such concerns?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We are loved. We must do everything we can to defeat any adversary, right? In that case, I will certainly meet your expectations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t even need to say anything for Benimaru to understand my thoughts. He even assured me that he would never go out of control. He&rsquo;s truly reliable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I believe you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just then, Shuna&rsquo;s speech was over. So, I awarded him right away.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Your command in this battle was truly outstanding! From this day forward, you can call yourself the &lsquo;Flare Lord&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, thank you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ritual began. He was usually friendly, but in front of the soldiers, he was the army commander. Benimaru was perfect at distinguishing between his private and public life. The title of &lsquo;Flare Lord&rsquo; was given to Benimaru. It was also a substitute for the title of &lsquo;True Demon Lord&rsquo; since he could not call himself a demon lord even if he became a True Demon Lord. The words used stood for fierce anger. He used to be a bit short-tempered, but now he always seems to keep his cool. Nevertheless, his nature was still a fiery flame. It&rsquo;s just that he&rsquo;s learned to burn and control his anger quietly. As the first demon lord to serve me, there could be no more fitting title.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Question: Using the specified amount of 100,000 souls, will you evolve the individual Benimaru?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">YES/NO&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">YES.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">As soon as I agreed, a &lsquo;Soul Corridor&rsquo; was created between me and Benimaru. It was not a thin connection as before, but a solid one. Through this, 100,000 souls would flow to Benimaru. At the same time, the evolution of Benimaru started</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">actually it didn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No change. Huh, is it a failure? Benimaru answered me with a thoughtful look on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Apparently, there is another condition for my evolution.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, no, it looks like it&rsquo;s not Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s problem, but mine&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For some reason, Benimaru was being ambiguous about what he was saying. What&rsquo;s going on? Something was fishy here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the problem?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked Benimaru in a quiet voice. He gave me a surprising answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, I heard the Voice of the World too. Apparently, I can evolve from an oni to a divine oni, but then I won&rsquo;t be able to have children.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru said that divine oni had no need to have children because they had no life span. Well, that was true. Oni were also a race that lived quite a long time. It was not surprising that they would lose their life expectancies if they were a higher race. That means that divine oni were probably a kind of spiritual life form. It seems that even demons don&rsquo;t have children, which is the fate of a species without a lifespan. There was no need for the preservation of the species, since they could be revived even after death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s the problem with that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sadly, I can&rsquo;t have children either. But it wasn&rsquo;t an inconvenience, and I didn&rsquo;t see it as a problem&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;It seems that I still have some unfinished business from when I was an ogre. I forgot about it myself, but I guess I have to finish my job as patriarch properly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does that job mean you have to have children in order to evolve?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, um. It seems that it is necessary to leave a next generation&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru and I were staring at each other again. We were currently in the middle of a celebration. It may look like I&rsquo;m throwing congratulatory words to Benimaru to the participants, but if I don&rsquo;t do something quickly, they will know that there is a problem. A little impatiently, I looked at Benimaru. Then Benimaru looked at me awkwardly. It was rare to see Benimaru like this. I was deeply moved by his attitude because he is usually so fearless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Prepare yourself, Benimaru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, but what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ignoring Benimaru&rsquo;s attempts to make excuses, I raised my voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. So you want to marry as a reward? So then, who is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey&mdash;Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was time for him to be a man&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t any of my business, but I held myself high. After all this, Benimaru had no choice but to make up his mind. To get the late blooming Benimaru to act, this kind of rough treatment was necessary.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;&hellip;Notice. This action may result in the strangulation of the Master.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">What?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wisdom King Raphael-san gave no answer to my query.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">No, no, no, it&rsquo;ll be alright.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I said this to myself, and the Colosseum erupted in cheers. It seemed that everyone had heard my voice and understood what I said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Brother, so you have finally made up your mind!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna smiled brightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, young man, who are you going to nominate as your partner?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou asked this question with his hand on his sword. Momiji and Alvis, who were in the guest of honor&rsquo;s seats, stood up before Benimaru could answer that question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama! I would like to ask your permission to speak!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;May I do the same? Like Momiji-sama, I have a request to make.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sensed a strong conviction from both of them. It was not an atmosphere in which I could say &lsquo;no&rsquo; anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, okay. Now then, will you two please come with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">We were in the middle of a celebration, but I didn&rsquo;t think this was the time to talk about it. Those in the Colosseum were already spectators waiting for a good show. There was complaining</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">or rather, it would be more likely to cause dissatisfaction if we stopped now. The two who came were allowed to speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, I would like to ask for permission to marry Benimaru-sama as a reward.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, Momiji made a bold statement. And then, Hakurou followed him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, the reward shall be that which is given. It is impolite to demand otherwise. However, I beg you to grant my daughter&rsquo;s wish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou requested Momiji to take over his own orders of merit as well. The way things were going now, it was difficult for me to refuse. Benimaru was frozen in his seat, unable to keep up with the situation. He was known for his good judgment, but now it seemed that he couldn&rsquo;t think straight. And then, another comment made the situation even more confusing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, please allow me to be Benimaru-sama&rsquo;s second wife!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Alvis, who was late to Momiji&rsquo;s statement, started to say something like that. Benimaru and I couldn&rsquo;t help speaking in unison, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Momiji and Alvis had been in a fierce battle over Benimaru. It was a well-known story to the point that it came to be known as an epic of love and war, so when did it end?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Momiji as the first wife and Alvis as the second wife?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Momiji and Alvis answered with a happy look on their faces. Benimaru&rsquo;s eyes were white. I don&rsquo;t know what happened between them, but it seems that a clear pecking order had been established.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is unbecoming of a wife to annoy Benimaru-sama with such things. I do not ask you to choose one of us, me or Alvis-san, so please take us both at the same time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, that&rsquo;s not how it works&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I discussed this with Momiji-sama, and we came to the conclusion that Benimaru-sama&rsquo;s caliber will not be a problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, no, no, what kind of conclusion is that?! Benimaru was looking at me as if begging for my help. Well, I&rsquo;m puzzled, too. I don&rsquo;t think I can help him so easily&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. According to the current rules of the Jura-Tempest Federation, polygamy is allowed for the purpose of procreation. However, it is limited to widows who wish to have children. In this case, the second wife would not be allowed.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, oh! That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For some reason, I feel that Wisdom King Raphael-san is actively cooperating with me, and now I can help Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Unfortunately, Alvis-san, in our country, only a widow who wishes to have a child can become a second wife. In the future, we intend to make it a law, and there is a possibility that the rule will be changed, but right now, we can&rsquo;t allow&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Feeling sorry, I tried to deny Alvis&rsquo; request. Benimaru nodded his head in relief, but it was a big mistake to think that this was the end of the story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ve been studying the rules of this country. Actually, I got married just a few days ago&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wait, she got married the other day?? With whom? I mean, in that case, it&rsquo;s impossible for her to get married to Benimaru, right? I thought so, but what Alvis said after that was beyond my imagination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;and I was sadly separated from my husband by death. Therefore, I fulfill the conditions to be the second wife of Benimaru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Huh? Wait a minute, wait a minute, that&rsquo;s not because of the war, is it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If so, that would be a big problem&hellip;Alvis&rsquo;s argument was so cunning that I felt foolish for worrying about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, wait, wait, what? Who was the husband of yours who you married?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That would be Phobio over there in the guest of honor section,&rdquo; Alvis told me with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Um, Phobio-san, you&rsquo;re still alive, right? Benimaru and I were confused and looked at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I don&rsquo;t know, you&rsquo;re asking me!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;But that&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We had a conversation only by looking at each other without even having to use the &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo;. Phobio came up to us and knelt down with an apologetic look on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry. My Alvis is speaking so self-righteously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, no. You were married? More importantly, are you dead??&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so the story began. Momiji, Alvis, and Phobio explained to me the whole story of Alvis&rsquo;s plan. In a nutshell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Momiji and Alvis had developed a kind of friendship through many fist fights. Then, Momiji and Alvis decided to change directions by assisting each other instead of fighting each other. What should they do so that they could both become Benimaru&rsquo;s wife? The answer they came up with was for Alvis to marry Phobio. After marrying Phobio, the two would fight in the labyrinth until one of them died. Alvis then won and reported herself as a widow. Since they had only fought a duel in the labyrinth, Phobio was still alive, of course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I won, she said she would marry me. So, can I cry?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s the reason why Phobio went along with the plan&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sight of Phobio drooping his head was so pathetic that I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel sorry for him. I mean, what should be done in this case?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rigurd, is this possible?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ha! It&rsquo;s a very simple and straightforward theory of power. This is the result of using wisdom and power to get what you want. If you ask me, this is totally fine!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see. Regurd, Rogurd, and Rugurd nodded their heads in agreement with Rigurd&rsquo;s statement. Seriously. In the eyes of a monster, Alvis&rsquo;s action is a good thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Brother. Momiji-sama and Alvis-sama have shown their determination up to this extent. Please be a man and give them your reply!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna was also in favor of Alvis&rsquo;s action? No, Shuna wasn&rsquo;t the only one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like it, tell them you don&rsquo;t like it, if it bothers you, tell them it bothers you, right? What&rsquo;s there to worry about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the case of Shion, she doesn&rsquo;t seem to be thinking much about it, but she still made a pretty good argument. Still, she does not seem to be against Benimaru taking two wives, and is simply urging them to answer. Surprisingly, there are no objections. No one seems to have any thoughts that this is unethical or unclean. Indeed, survival of the fittest is the rule of monsters. The strong takes everything, and is only limited by the rules I have set. If they want it, and no one complains about it, I think it&rsquo;s okay to accept this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru, how long do you intend to keep worrying about this? Your father will laugh at you in the afterlife if you keep being so indecisive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Souei&hellip;you may say so, but my father loved only my mother and brought me and Shuna into this world. What&rsquo;s wrong with me wanting to be like him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru seems to be unusually agitated, perhaps because Souei&rsquo;s words were painful to his ears. However, Souei did not budge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say it was bad. You seem to doubt your love, but why don&rsquo;t you just have children? If a man and a woman don&rsquo;t love each other, they can&rsquo;t have a child. If you don&rsquo;t have feelings for them, then just say no from the beginning. But if you have even a little bit of feelings for them, why don&rsquo;t you just hold them and show them the result?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei-san, you are too blunt. Although it seemed like harsh sexual harassment, I hated the fact that it looked so good on him. And the argument appeared to make sense to the monsters. I forgot that no child could be born without love. Benimaru is troubled because he feels it is unfaithful to love both of them at the same time. Moreover, choosing one or the other would cause grief to the one who remains. That is why he has been postponing to give an answer. I didn&rsquo;t dislike that kind of thinking. But in this case, if we show the result as Souei says, all the problems would be solved, wouldn&rsquo;t they?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alvis-san, let&rsquo;s see who can conceive Benimaru-sama&rsquo;s child first!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t lose, Momiji-sama. My love is real. All that&rsquo;s left is to win Benimaru-sama&rsquo;s heart!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think that was the hardest part, but they don&rsquo;t seem to be bothered by it. It was all up to Benimaru&rsquo;s heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru, we are in the middle of a celebration. It&rsquo;s a place to honor your deeds. I will allow you all your selfishness, so please answer me sincerely. Will you respond to Momiji and Alvis&rsquo; courtship or not? Which is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Benimaru does not like it, we will be done talking about it. But if not&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Momiji, Alvis, as the &lsquo;Samurai general&rsquo; protecting Rimuru-sama, I may not be able to stay by your side forever. Still, are you willing to choose me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was sincere to the end. He was worried about the future. When Benimaru has no more regrets after having children, he will evolve into a divine oni. Then he will no longer have a life span, and there will come a time when he will forever be separated from Momiji and Alvis. Of course. Since only he will evolve, his two wives will be left behind&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a situation like this, it was a bit harsh to ask for an answer so suddenly. Even I, though I don&rsquo;t feel it yet, would find it hard to see my loved one leave me before I do. Well, I am not talking about a specific individual, but about all my friends in general. I could understand Benimaru&rsquo;s concern, and I thought that Momiji and Alvis might also be affected, but my fears were unfounded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem at all! After I raise my children, I will somehow evolve as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree with you. And even if evolution is impossible, my children will comfort you in your ennui.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Women are so strong. These two showed her determination as if unfazed. Hearing their reply, Benimaru gave a fresh smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama! May I have your permission to take two wives?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could not and would not say no here. It would set an unreasonable precedent, but if they would be allowed to do so if they perform well, as they have done in this case, it might give them hope and encourage them to work harder. I decided that it was okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru is a pure-hearted man who pretends to be hard-core. If I had left him alone, he would have been a bachelor forever, and I would consider this as a good opportunity for him. If there is a concern, it is if he could love both Momiji and Alvis at the same time, but I believe that Benimaru will be able to get through this. And I will cheer for him, too. I jumped out of my chair and changed into human form. Then, I announced loudly:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Permission granted! In my name, I grant Benimaru, Momiji, and Alvis the right to &lsquo;the union of souls&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the case of monsters, marriage is like a union of souls. It is obvious from the fact that no child can be born without love. That is why it is appropriate to call it &lsquo;the union of souls&rsquo;. Hearing my declaration, a smile was etched on Benimaru&rsquo;s mouth. His face was dyed red with joy, and he was still clutching Momiji and Alvis in his arms, his chest outstretched.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="HAREM LORD BENIMARU" src="images/image23.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you. I will surely love them both and show them my sincerity!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Momiji and Alvis were in tears of joy after hearing Benimaru&rsquo;s magnificent speech. They seemed to be speechless with emotion. Honestly, I&rsquo;m so envious of Benimaru. A beautiful girl and a beautiful woman, they were truly a flower in each hand. But&hellip; I guess it will be difficult for the shy Benimaru from now on. Well, I can&rsquo;t speak for others either. In my case, I&rsquo;m asexual, so there&rsquo;s no use in thinking about it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s speech was greeted with loud cheers in the Colosseum. Shuna was happily congratulating her brother, and Shion was clapping proudly for some reason. Of course, I heard not only the congratulations but also some jealous and resentful voices, but that much was still a blessing. Thus, Momiji, Alvis, and Benimaru were celebrating amidst the cheers of the participants in this festive event.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would have liked to continue the celebration, but we were in the middle of the event and I wanted to give priority to the evolutionary rituals. Let&rsquo;s just announce it now and have Benimaru&rsquo;s wedding ceremony slowly after this evolutionary rite called &lsquo;victory celebration&rsquo; is over. We were going to have a banquet again today, but the more the merrier. So, for now, the priority was on the celebration event. I let the happy Benimaru and company move back and ordered Shuna to just make the arrangements. The incessant cheering finally died down when I raised my hand. It was indeed an unexpected happening. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Gobua breaking down in tears, and for some reason Phobio was comforting them, but there is no time for that now. We decided to continue the celebration.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

After watching me, Shuna&rsquo;s dignified voice echoed in the hall, where the excitement had not yet cooled down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The three grand corps commanders, step forward!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three corps commanders are the commanders of the First, Second, and Third Corps. That is, Gobta, Geld, and Gabil knelt before me. Let&rsquo;s start with Gobta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahem! Gobta-kun, you will not be rewarded!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I said this to Gobta, who was looking at me with an expectant expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? That&rsquo;s terrible! Then, why did you call me here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good question. I don&rsquo;t have a reward for you, but I&rsquo;m going to give you one right in return.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Giving souls to Gobta will not make him evolve. He is a talented guy, but he is not qualified for it. I considered giving Gobta weapons and armor, but I decided that Gobta could not handle more than what I am giving him now. Besides, he can &lsquo;Magic Wolf Unification&rsquo; with Ranga anyway, so he doesn&rsquo;t need any half-assed armor. Even if I gave him money, he would not use it for anything useful. What&rsquo;s more, the corps commanders are well-paid. He should be able to make a good living, since he receives a considerable amount of money points every month. In the case of a human nation, we would have given him a territory, but our country does not have any territory that can be ceded. Besides, Gobta would not be able to rule, so this was a meaningless example. And so, I decided to grant Gobta special rights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta was puzzled by my words. I guess he did not understand what I meant by the word &lsquo;right&rsquo; alone. Then, I will just tell him the answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have the right to treat me &lsquo;casually&rsquo;, with the same informal tone that you have always been using up until now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">I flashed a smirk at Gobta, who remained puzzled, and declared as such.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">Before Gobta could even comprehend my words, there was a roar of cheers</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">or rather, shouts of rage</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">that was even louder than the one that had just been given to Benimaru. It was a cheer so loud that it was impossible to hide any jealousy. Even Shion and Shuna were staring at Gobta with terrifying eyes. They seemed to be very envious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, uh, are you serious?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;After all, you can&rsquo;t even speak honorifics, can you? I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re going to screw it up big time one day, so I&rsquo;ve decided to take this opportunity to recognize it as your right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta&rsquo;s tone of voice was not good at all, though I could also sense his respect. I mean, I usually tell everyone to talk to me casually, but it seems to be quite difficult. In such a situation, there have been frequent complaints about Gobta&rsquo;s informal conversational style. They wanted me to do something about it because it would affect my external reputation. Since that was a hassle, I decided to recognize it as a &lsquo;right&rsquo;. There were many foreign guests such as Phobio and Jaine-san at this celebration. The idea was that the publicity here would solve Gobta&rsquo;s problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Well, I guess there are a lot of other troublesome things to worry about, such as appearance and authority, but we, as monsters, did not need such a formal system.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">I would just do what I wanted to do. What is important is not what is on the outside but what is on the inside. Gobta is a good example.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His tone may have been foul, but his loyalty was real. I could see it in his eyes. Gobta had a look in his eyes that says he is willing to die for me. That&rsquo;s why this is his &lsquo;right&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta bowed with a big smile, bending at a ninety-degree angle. He was overjoyed. Perhaps, he had been trying to correct his tone of voice. It hadn&rsquo;t worked at all, though. I am happy for Gobta that it was the best reward for him. Appropriate rewards were really hard to come up with.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I will strive to live up to the name &lsquo;Barrier Lord&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld responded strongly. Amidst the loud cheers, I secretly told Geld my message behind the scenes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will attempt the same evolutionary ritual on you as I did on Benimaru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just what is that&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t want to explain it every time, so I connected a &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; to those who were going to be given souls. Then, I explained about the evolutionary ritual to all of them. At this time, I also remembered to use &lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo; in combination with &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo;. By doing this, we could have an important conversation in less than a few seconds in real time. After a brief explanation, Geld responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I appreciate the offer, but I think there is someone better qualified for this reward. Carrera-dono, the inspector general, has been a major player in this war. If she is also qualified, then by all means, please let Carrera-dono take the reward instead of me&mdash;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmmm, declining to awaken with a soul&rsquo;s power?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I did not plan to have Carrera evolve this time. I had no doubt that Carrera was a major player, but I did not want her to go out of control when she gained power, even though she was already so dangerous at this stage. Because I needed to take a wait-and-see attitude, I wanted to wait on evolving Carrera in the meantime, choosing to advance the oldest and most reliable subordinates. I explained as such, but Geld was still hesitating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;But I am also&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, Geld was worried. He was afraid that he would get too powerful and lose control. And perhaps he was still trying to make amends. Amends for the great disaster that he had caused in the Great Jura Forest by his outburst at that time. As the one who bears the responsibility, he was strictly controlling himself. His eyes were shining with strong will, and he looked at me with determination. That is why I answered him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Geld. Even though Geld, the orc disaster, went berserk, it was for the sake of his friends, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld would not lose control. If he had that much determination, he would be able to control whatever power he gained. And&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no one left to denigrate Geld because of past events.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;You still feel responsible, but I believe in you. And I know you will use your newfound strength to protect us all!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Geld evolves, his servants will also receive a gift. That means our country will gain a strong defense. When I explained this, Geld&rsquo;s eyes shone brightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;&hellip;If that&rsquo;s the case, I humbly accept!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He agreed. As expected of Geld. A man who works for the good of his people, not for himself. By the way, there was no one who refused, except for Geld. Some of them seemed to be anxious, but I felt that their expectations were higher than their apprehensions. It was my fault that I did not confirm their intentions beforehand, but momentum was important in this case. I was relieved that everyone agreed to the plan. I deactivated the &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; and resumed the festivities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your work has been truly outstanding. As a reward, I give you this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then I signaled to Shuna. Shuna nodded with a smile and handed Geld a set of equipment she had prepared. The armor and shield were legendary-grade equipment that I had acquired in this battle, and I modified them myself in consultation with Garm. It was an exclusive weapon that only Geld could use by reacting to his monstrous aura. The principle was the same as that of the &lsquo;Holy Spirit Armor&rsquo;, which could not be reproduced even by Garm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The difference between mythical-grade and legendary-grade is the maturity level of the armor itself. The weapons themselves evolved over a long period of time. The evolution varied from one to another, and the number of years required depended on the materials. In addition, it was said that the speed of evolution increased dramatically if the owner was superior. Since Geld had a defensive specialization, I expected that even legendary-grade equipment would soon have a defensive ability comparable to that of mythical-grade equipment. On the contrary, Wisdom King Raphael-san said that there was a high possibility that Geld would gain a gift with his evolution. I am sure that it would reach the mythical-grade. If that happened, his defense would be much stronger. Geld accepted his prize reverently and bowed to me.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Question: Using the specified amount of 100,000 souls, will you evolve the individual Geld?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">YES/NO&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">YES&mdash;After doing this, I called out to Geld.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been giving yourself a hard time, all these years. This is a good time for you to get some rest, and to think about what you wish to do for yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld will not only fight in battles, but will continue to play an active role in the construction of the city. He has been working hard all his life and rarely takes a proper rest. He was probably the hardest worker in the country. I hoped that he would take this opportunity to take a good rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes! Thank you very much for this happiness!&rdquo; Geld replied, smiling happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then he returned to the line in a nonchalant manner, as if resisting the evolutionary slumber caused by the influence of the Harvest Festival on a demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I was so impressed that I turned my attention to the next person. Gabil. He had led the Third Corps in a brilliant aerial battle. When I congratulated him, he looked down with a sincere face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t enough. I am ashamed of my lack of talent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;Truth be told, Gabil really deserved it. The idea of having magic endurance training in the middle of a war is something that no one could imitate. Or rather it&rsquo;s not that I can&rsquo;t imitate it, but that I wouldn&rsquo;t want to imitate it. After the battle, I received a detailed report from Ultima, and was appalled at how stupid they had been. She even advised that Gabil-san should be punished. I didn&rsquo;t know when he had become such an experiment-loving bastard&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But thanks to that, it seems that Gabil and his team have figured out the secret of dragonewt&rsquo;s Intrinsic Skill-&rsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo;. I would have a big heart and not get angry this time. Besides, there were more important things for now. I also switched to &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; and spoke to Gabil. It was a private chat, since it would be counterproductive to scold him in front of everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I&rsquo;ll speak more about the experiments during the war later, but there is this. Ultima has a proposal. She is willing to teach you how to control your magicules.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;What did you say?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;For the demon race, dealing with magicules is as easy as breathing. She is willing to take care of you guys, so please get along with her and ask her for advice.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He might only be assuaged if I punish him, but it would be better for him to be treated by Ultima. As you know, Ultima would understand how to be lenient and only suffer a little before they could reflect on themselves. That was my decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We are still inexperienced. I, Gabil, am grateful to you for giving us an opportunity to grow further! We will strive to meet Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s expectations so that all of us can master the &lsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The response was surprisingly positive. It seems that they were prepared for it. Gabil, too, missed the days when he used to be beaten by Gobta. His goofy personality had calmed down a lot now. He had learned to read the atmosphere around him and had gained the dignity of a warlord. As he said, he still had some ways to go, but it seems that he had certain qualities to begin with, and through the bitter defeats and his interactions with Vesta and others, he had now acquired a thoughtful mindset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was now a reliable person. The experiences he had accumulated have helped Gabil to grow up. Therefore, I could trust him with power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will give you power. Use it well and awaken as the &lsquo;Draco Lord&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I gave Gabil the souls and encouraged him to evolve. Unlike Geld, Gabil&rsquo;s evolution was dramatic. His blackish-purple scales turned reddish-purple, and fiery magicules ran through his body. Gabil, however, endured the situation admirably. He kept his consciousness only with his spirit, and controlled himself. The experiment was not in vain, and it had borne fruit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wooooooooooo! I feel full of power! Thank you, Rimuru-sama! From this day forward, I shall call myself &lsquo;Draco Lord&rsquo;. And for the sake of Rimuru-sama and this country, I will use this power to my utmost!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A purple lightning shot was released from Gabil&rsquo;s body and roasted himself. However, Gabil&rsquo;s body began to heal instantly, transforming into a stronger body. It seems that it was a success. Perhaps because I told him to call himself a &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;, but Gabil now had a magnificent horn sprouting from his forehead. Gabil looked very handsome and well-fitted, even if he was a bit cocky. But that was all right. It was a magnificent evolution of both dignity and power. Thus, the &lsquo;Draco Lord&rsquo; Gabil was born.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That said, it seems that the evolution into a &lsquo;True Demon Lord&rsquo; varies from individual to individual. I myself had fallen into an irresistible deep sleep, and Geld was currently trying his best to stay awake. Benimaru needed additional conditions. In Gabil&rsquo;s case, it was all done in a moment, without even falling asleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gabil-sama, I&rsquo;m feeling full of energy too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me too. Gabil-sama is the best!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such voices could be heard from the corner where the Third Corps was lined up. It was the group of a hundred &lsquo;Hiryuu&rsquo;. The lizardmen who were members of the Blue Numbers also seemed to be receiving gifts. All three thousand of them had evolved into dragonewts. The &lsquo;Hiryuu&rsquo; had successfully broken through the barrier of A rank, and had gained enough fighting ability to be called mid-level majin. It was as if their &lsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo; was now normalized and the Skill itself was gone. The &lsquo;Dragon Scaling&rsquo; skill, which transformed the skin into dragon scales, also seemed to have disappeared, and they gained a new skill called &lsquo;Dragon Skin&rsquo; in its place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would leave the control of power to Ultima, but the problem was the newly acquired skill. It covered the body with self-repairing armor, taking in the surrounding magicules. In principle, it was the same as &lsquo;body armor&rsquo;, but its defense was incomparably higher. Since it regenerated even small scratches, it was very economical and did not require any protective gear. Moreover, the strength of the skill varied from person to person, and increased in proportion to the strength of the user. I was surprised to see that the strength of Gabil&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dragon Skin&rsquo;, for example, had jumped up to almost mythical-grade protection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, that kind of perfect defense was also reflected in the attack. Although they were still dragonewts in terms of their race, they had been so strengthened that it would not be an exaggeration to say that they were different from other dragonewts. In the end, they could not be humanized, but that was not important because it was a matter of personal will.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then there were the others. Surprisingly, even Souka and the others were affected by the evolution of Gabil. Those of this group were humanoid dragonewts. Since they were still in human form, their defense was inferior. However, their speed and attack power had been greatly increased. The skill possessed by these dragonewts was the same as that of &lsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo;, but while still retaining a human face after the transformation, which was different from Gabil&rsquo;s group. It seems that the scales and wings of a dragon can be taken in and out at will, but after the transformation, they appeared to become majin with the motif of a dragon&rsquo;s figure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although they were the same species as Gabil and the others, they seemed to follow completely different evolutionary paths. If they continued to evolve further, they might even become another species. In terms of strength, Souka and her members are superior to those of the Hiryuu. They had been strengthened to the extent that one could call them &lsquo;greater majin&rsquo;, and Souka herself had enough magicules to be comparable to an archdemon. As expected, they had succeeded in greatly increasing their strength.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Come forward!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Gobta, one could not forget Ranga. And then there was Hakurou, who was the advisor. And then there were the three demon girls who had been appointed as inspectors and intelligence officers. When I called Ranga, he appeared quietly from my shadow. Hakurou, too, appeared without a sign. Testarossa was graceful, Ultima was light, and Carrera was majestic. They came up to the dais and knelt before me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that they were all here, I would reward them in turn. First was Ranga. He had assisted Gobta and did a job well done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ranga, you not only fought alongside Gobta, but you protected him as well, so I thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean, my lord? I merely did what I had to do!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hahaha, what a cute guy. Still, I was well aware how happy he was to hear my compliments by the wagging of his tail.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, from this day forward, you can call yourself the &lsquo;Star Lord&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ranga roared and accepted. Immediately, a &lsquo;Soul Corridor&rsquo; was established between us. Ranga, as in my case, began to evolve instantly and the Harvest Festival seems to have started.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gggggh, my lord&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sleepy? Then take it easy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was nothing to be patient about. I put Ranga back in my shadow and let him sleep. By the looks of things, I&rsquo;m sure the wolves under my command had received the gift as well. I was very much looking forward to seeing what would happen after the evolution. Ranga did not run rampant, and fell asleep in my shadow. The four were now done. At this rate, it seemed like I would have nothing to worry about, but let&rsquo;s just continue the ritual without letting up until the end.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next was Hakurou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have done a great job in your role as Gobta&rsquo;s advisor. Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. Gobta is growing up, and soon he won&rsquo;t need my help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, no, there is a big difference between the presence and absence of Hakurou. So, as for the reward&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a moment, Rimuru-sama. For my part, it is enough that you have listened to my daughter Momiji&rsquo;s wishes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, I remember him saying that earlier. However, I can&rsquo;t just leave it at that, can I?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Those are two different things. I wish Benimaru and Momiji the best. Besides, it must be complicated for you as a father, now that Alvis-san has intervened, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I spoke to Hakurou through &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; again. Telepathy Net&rsquo; was very useful for me because I could talk in front of many people without worrying about time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I thought about that a little. But I believe in young Benimaru-sama. And my daughter&rsquo;s eyes are also reliable. So, I am satisfied.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s good. I believe Benimaru will make them both happy.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But God only knows if they will have children or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;So&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Wait a minute. Aren&rsquo;t awards for merit important? Besides, the prize I prepared for you is the work I asked Kurobee to do for me. I hope you will accept it so that Kurobee&rsquo;s efforts won&rsquo;t go to waste.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right. I had prepared Hakurou a newly forged sword. Recently, Kurobee has been improving his skills rapidly. The quality of his work is excellent, and it was a legendary-grade sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, Benimaru&rsquo;s &lsquo;Red Lotus&rsquo; was also made by Kurobee&rsquo;s hands. Benimaru was not able to show his true potential in the previous battle due to the difference in the performance of his weapons. Kurobee, who heard that, had blamed himself for it and became inspired by the fact. He shut himself up in his workshop, determined to forge him the best sword he could. Kurobee&rsquo;s sword, though not quite as good as the Red Lotus, was a sword forged with his heart and soul. Hakurou would surely appreciate it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Oh, Kurobee&hellip;in that case, I will accept it with gratitude!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yes, feel free to take it!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good, good, good. If he declined, I would have been at a loss as to what to do. I still think he is a little too modest, though modesty is a virtue. In that case, let&rsquo;s continue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. This is for you. Take it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s kindness shall not be wasted. I, Hakurou humbly accept this sword!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou smoothly received the sword.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next, it was time to move on to the three demon girls. Actually, I had a hard time deciding what to do at first. If I were to consider only increasing our strength, it would be natural to evolve the three demon peers. But as I explained to Benimaru and Geld, I decided not to evolve them at this time. One of the reasons was that I did not have enough souls, but the other reason was that I myself am not sure if I could control them. As long as I do not know how strong they can become, they&rsquo;ll have to be put on hold. Since these three were the same level as Diablo, I decided to let Diablo evolve first and see how it goes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frankly, Diablo makes me a little uneasy in another sense, but&hellip;well, it&rsquo;s better not to think too much about that for now. From my point of view, Diablo seems to be one of the strongest. Even amongst the &lsquo;primordials&rsquo;, there seems to be some variation in strength depending on their personalities. The three demon girls are under my direct control, and I have them put under Diablo&rsquo;s care. Therefore, I will think about their evolution after Diablo&rsquo;s evolution is completed and settled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so, the souls I have currently are not enough to evolve them. There seems to be some sort of check and balance formed between these three, so I think it would be problematic to give them a chance to question superiority or inferiority. If anything, it would be too dangerous. Unless they all evolve at the same time, there would be trouble. I was tempted to consider only Carrera, since Geld suggested it, but I decided not to do it for that very reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, Carrera possessed more than Diablo in terms of total magicules. It seemed too risky to give her power. Uncontrollable power is self-destructive&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I felt. After all, the nuclear magic that Carrera used&mdash;&rsquo;Gravity Collapse&rsquo;&mdash;was no good. If it had failed, even Geld and his friends would have been blown away. Though it was completely controlled, the character of a person who could unleash that kind of magic without hesitation in that situation made me feel a little uneasy. It&rsquo;s important to check safety in everything. I decided to wait and see how things would turn out before deciding whether to evolve her or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera, you three have done an excellent job as intelligence officers. We are also making good use of the souls you have gathered for us. There may be dissatisfaction if I use what you have gathered for people other than yourselves&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had thought about keeping quiet about the evolution of the souls, but Testa and the others had been the main contributors to the collection of souls. I felt that it would be impolite to remain silent, so I confided in them, but they contradicted me with a force that interrupted my words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, what do you mean?! We have no complaints!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! On the contrary, we are the ones who have not repaid you enough!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They are both right, milord. We are already content. We&rsquo;ve been given bodies. And even a name. That alone is enough to make us strong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All three, in unison, denied any possible dissatisfaction. Indeed, they were already more than strong enough. Even as they are now, they were stronger than the awakened Gabil. Hearing them say that, I was convinced. But not giving them rewards was another matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am glad to hear you say that. It makes me feel that my heart will always be with you. That is why I hope you will accept the reward I have prepared for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A reward?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is no way out of it. If the lord has said so, how can I refuse?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right? If they refuse, it will be too much trouble, so I blocked the way out first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In recognition of your work this time, I am going to recognize you as executives. You will continue to work as usual, but in times of war, you will be given a part of the command authority. I will give you these titles as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Killer Lord&rsquo; Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Pain Lord&rsquo; Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Menace Lord&rsquo; Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These were the titles I came up with after interviewing a few people. I know the names sound pretty brutal, but they reflect exactly what had been happening during this war. Their role as leaders was to fight, and I thought it suited them well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From this day forward, I permit you to call yourselves as such. From now on, I expect you to serve as my confidants, just like the senior executives!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;By your will&hellip;&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing my words, all three of them bowed their heads in unison. Apparently, they liked the new titles. I watched the five of them return to the line, feeling glad that I had not received any complaints.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Next, I would call up those who had been active in the labyrinth. Gozer and Mezer were given a new set of equipment. I officially appointed Gadra as a Guardian of the 60th floor, and entrusted him with the Demon Colossus. Beretta was now retired as the head of &lsquo;Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten&rsquo;. Gadra was now officially a member of the &lsquo;Elite Ten&rsquo;. As a reward, he would have access to the research facilities on each floor. From now on, he would be involved in the research side of things, too, anyway. I decided to trust him. He was overjoyed, so I guess it was a good reward for him. If he stole my research data, that would be the time to talk. However, I felt that it was a useless worry. He was a lovable old man, and I hoped he would do his best as an ally from now on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So far, everything was going well. In that case, it was time to get down to business. Beretta and the four dragon kings who retired from the Elite Ten were not my subordinates. They were under Ramiris, so I would leave them aside for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Guardian of the 90th floor</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">&rsquo;Nine head&rsquo; Kumara.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Guardian of the 80th floor</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">&rsquo;Insect Kaiser&rsquo; Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Floor Boss of the 79th floor</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">&rsquo;Insect Queen&rsquo; Apito.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Guardian of the 70th floor</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">&rsquo;Immortal King&rsquo; Adalmann.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard of the 70th floor&mdash;&rsquo;Death Paladin&rsquo; Albert.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lineup of eminent figures. At this point, there seemed to be no need to worry about anyone losing control. So it was time to evolve them one by one.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">First up was Kumara. I had given Kumara the title of &lsquo;Chimera Lord&rsquo;.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">Kumara seemed to have grown in stature, perhaps because she had successfully accomplished her revenge in this battle. Come to think of it, Kumara had been an enemy of mine when we first met. You never know how things will turn out in this world. Clayman had been manipulating her, but she was happy and proud to defeat Colonel Kansas who was the cause of the manipulation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason why I entrusted her with the labyrinth was because Ranga told me that she was good at pioneering forests. I had been advised to entrust Kumara as the Guardian of the 90th floor, so I decided to entrust her with the job. If he had not said that, Kumara might still be a fox cub. I knew Kumara was a powerful young beast, but I had no idea that she would eventually become one of the &lsquo;Elite Ten&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, perhaps it was destined to happen the moment I gave her the name. In any case, I was thankful for Ranga&rsquo;s suggestion. Kumara was now the master of eight magic beasts. Each of the magic beasts that served as Floor Bosses on the 82-89th floors were so strong that they were equivalent to Calamity-class. They were the eight parts of Kumara, and they looked vaguely familiar to me, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few days after naming Kumara, I once went to check on them while taking a walk. At that time, Kumara asked me to call each of her friends by name. I was introduced to a group of adorable child magic beasts. I have experienced countless failures in &lsquo;naming&rsquo; monsters. Because I was such a person, I clearly understood the dangers of name-related matters. But all I had to do in this case was to call out the name of the tailed beast that Kumara had already decided on. I thought it was a good idea, and I accepted it with a casual feeling. Of course, it&rsquo;s not that I did it because a young girl asked me to, or because I had such a strong desire to do so&mdash;anyone can understand without any explanation. I didn&rsquo;t expect that it would turn out like this&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that I think about it, I suspect that it was actually a &lsquo;Naming&rsquo; as well. After all, the eight animals introduced at that time did not have such a high fighting ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. Yes. A similar phenomenon to &lsquo;naming&rsquo; has been confirmed, although strictly speaking it is different. As a result, the bond between the tailed beasts and the individual Kumara has been strengthened.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, I knew it. I didn&rsquo;t notice it because they didn&rsquo;t enter a mode of low activity and I didn&rsquo;t see any change in the magic beasts at that time, but I had thought as such ever since I saw their battle. The magic beasts who were once so cute were now the eight members, possessing a fierce power. It was an amazing before and after. Everyone was surprised. I was surprised too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In effect, Kumara had received an equivalent of nine names from me. As a result, the bond between the eight and Kumara had been strengthened. And even the power that the tailed beasts had grown by absorbing the dense magicules of the labyrinth had been returned to the main body Kumara to give her strength overall. Well, there was no point in worrying about what has already been done. Kumara might have been defeated without it, so I will say that the result was overall good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I awarded Kumara the souls. As soon as I did so, she succeeded in evolving into a demon lord. The eight beasts of Kumara&rsquo;s body shined and returned to her main body with a glow. Kumara then grew nine tails. One of the tails, which had originally remained, turned golden. The remaining eight tails became a shimmering silvery white. They were tails with very beautiful fur. But even more beautiful than that was Kumara herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara&rsquo;s body turned out so voluptuous and seductive that she was completely unimaginable from her infantile appearance. She appeared to be even more attractive than before. Her long hair changed from brown to golden, like ears of rice reflecting the light, and it ran down her back, silky and shiny. Was it beauty that underwent evolution?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, of course, the amount of magicules had increased. At this stage, she had already surpassed the awakened Gabil. I never expected her to reach this level. Kumara herself had a great deal of fighting power, but it was only when all the eight beasts were combined into a composite beast form (chimera mode) that she could display her most powerful ability. Conversely, Kumara becoming more powerful meant that the Eight Beasts would follow suit and also become more powerful. What&rsquo;s more, their souls were connected through my &lsquo;Naming&rsquo;, and a gift was given only to those eight&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the most foul point was that the power given to them would be returned to Kumara, making her even stronger. In a sense, this was a monopoly of power. From Kumara, I sensed a sly, calculating nature that I could not have imagined based on her beautiful appearance. It was no wonder that Kumara did not get along with an honest and direct person like Apito. Still, there was no reason why such a drastic evolution should have to be such a burden on Kumara. Kumara seemed to be doing her best just to stay conscious. If she kept forcing herself like this, she may lose control, so this had to be stopped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go back and get some rest.&rdquo; I ordered gently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara looked a little disappointed, but she obeyed my order honestly. Most likely, she would sleep like Ranga and get used to her increased strength. In any case, I was looking forward to seeing her growth. No, even now, she is already a great beauty at this stage of her life. Anyway, Kumara left and returned to her own guardian realm.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Zegion and Apito were next. I started with Apito first, leaving Zegion for later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Apito, you did a great job in the last battle. That man Minits was by far the strongest of the Imperial generals. You fought him on equal terms. Your strength is real. You should be proud of yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When all was said and done, it was not power that I desired from Apito. All I was really looking for was honey, and as long as the honey improved in its productivity and quality, that&rsquo;s all I could hope for. It was strange how Apito had become an &lsquo;Insect Queen&rsquo; and a member of the &lsquo;Elite Ten&rsquo; before I even realized it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Surely you jest. I, for one, was not even close to being ready. After losing all of my compatriots, I only managed to pull out a draw.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, nothing like that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I tried to deny it, but I couldn&rsquo;t speak after seeing Apito&rsquo;s smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I did not achieve a complete victory this time. Therefore, I do not think I am entitled to a reward.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You say that, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, if I am allowed to make a wish, will you allow the souls of my brethren who died in the last battle to dwell in me once again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What? What did you say? She doesn&rsquo;t want any reward, but suddenly she&rsquo;s asking for something this crazy! These guys, they are definitely mistaking me for some amazing guy who can do anything, aren&rsquo;t they? How can anything like this be&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. It is possible.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you can do it! Myself aside, the Wisdom King Raphael-san is awesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay. Then I will let the spirits of the dead board you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito&rsquo;s brethren were such demonic bugs that she didn&rsquo;t even need to give them &lsquo;Resurrection Bracelets&rsquo;. I wondered whether I could call them &lsquo;Heroic Spirits&rsquo; or not, but I said as such on this occasion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am grateful for this happiness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito was not qualified to evolve, but perhaps Zegion&rsquo;s evolution would give her a gift. That&rsquo;s why I decided to give her what she wished for. Since Apito was pleased, I decided that this was the right choice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next was Zegion. I thought of putting off Zegion&rsquo;s reward because he was the strongest, but I felt that it would be unnecessary to worry about it. After all, just by looking at his calmness told me that he would have nothing to do, losing control. As expected, he was the most powerful being in the labyrinth. Wisdom King Raphael-san also recognized his exceptional fighting sense, and his magicule count was as high as Benimaru&rsquo;s. After taking Veldora as a teacher, he had even mastered the dubious fighting techniques of manga. No wonder he was so strong. In this war as well, he alone had defeated the strongest of the Imperial Army whom the other &lsquo;Elite Ten&rsquo; members would have had a difficult time against.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They would be fools if they lost the battle against them at the same time. Zegion, however, was able to beat them with a crushing defeat, without letting them get away with it. He proved that he was a very powerful fighter. Although it was speculation, Zegion was probably stronger than any normal demon lord now. Even I, an awakened &lsquo;True Demon Lord&rsquo;, might lose to him if I let my guard down. But to awaken such a Zegion&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had heard that even Diablo and his colleagues couldn&rsquo;t beat him, so I was really getting worried. However, that was then and this is now. There were already several awakened demon lords in the making, so it was too late to worry about this now. I had already given souls to five of them, and the evolution ritual was still underway. As proof, I had been feeling an influx of power. The Harvest Festival of those who had fallen asleep was being returned to me through the &lsquo;Food Chain&rsquo;. It was a lot of power, but my body was taking it in without any problem as if it were a tank short on fuel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. Momentum was the key for this kind of thing, and I would just go with it. Don&rsquo;t be afraid and keep moving forward! That&rsquo;s basically how I felt. Thinking about things the other way around. How strong would Zegion become? Thinking of it that way, I felt excited. There was a possibility that Zegion would surpass me, but as long as the &lsquo;Food Chain&rsquo; was there, my advantage would not be reversed. Believing this, I resumed the ritual without worrying about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really something. To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to be this strong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is all thanks to Rimuru-sama and his guidance!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, it was Veldora who taught you, wasn&rsquo;t it&mdash;wait? Wisdom King Raphael-san had been sneaking around behind my back, too. Then perhaps he thought that was me. It would be too much trouble to correct him, so I decided to just leave it at that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No need to be modest. It&rsquo;s only due to your untiring efforts. Please continue to hone your strength for me. And from this day forward, I will allow you to call yourself the &lsquo;Mist Lord&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I was moved with awe!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion was as taciturn as ever, but he was inspired and motivated by my words. What might have sounded like random words to me, must have sounded like gospel to Zegion. I guess he had more of a worship filter than I expected, but it&rsquo;s not too bad to be admired at this level, is it? I originally thought that I would just be protecting a rare insect, but as it turned out, I was now the one being protected. Zegion&rsquo;s growth was not something I deliberately cultivated, but was rather due to his talent. In addition to that, there was the dense magic leaking out of Veldora and the training environment in which one can come back to life even after death. Also, there was a training partner who was so much better than Zegion. One could not ask for more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, the reasons were still trivial. He got stronger as a result, that&rsquo;s all that mattered. I gave Zegion the souls. Zegion trembled for a moment, but he managed to control the flood of power with his will alone. Unlike Gabil&rsquo;s case, he was enduring it with sheer perseverance. Seeing him do that made me feel a bit gutless for falling asleep so easily. I didn&rsquo;t think that was something that could be done with just spirit or guts, but I couldn&rsquo;t deny it now after seeing the real example in front of my eyes. Zegion evolved into an extremely terrifying being. According to his will, a part of his outer shell was transformed into hihiirokane. In addition to being coupled with various laws, Zegion&rsquo;s exoskeleton was comparable to a mythical-grade hardness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This meant that his body itself was a weapon. In terms of combat ability alone, Zegion was unquestionably the strongest. Although for spiritual life forms, strength in combat did not affect their superiority&hellip;but even so, they were sure to be a threat. Even now, while Zegion was still in the process of evolution, he seemed to be acquiring various other abilities. It would be exciting to see how he gradually evolved later on. Despite Zegion&rsquo;s suppression by force of will, the Harvest Festival was definitely still taking place. And as expected, Apito appeared to be the only target of a gift.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion and Apito were the only ones I had helped by giving them my own cells. That is why Apito was the only blood relative for Zegion. Although there were other dangerous species in the hierarchy of bugs, they were nearly wiped out in this defense battle. They would not be resurrected, but would have to wait for natural emergence. The rest were Apito&rsquo;s dependents, but all of them had been killed. The souls of these bugs were given to Apito just now. I wondered what she was going to do with them, but it seemed as if she was going to use them for her own enhancement. The result of her evolution would prove it. During the celebration, Apito also did not look distressed in front of me. She remained calm and endured with the dignity of a queen. Like Zegion, I was impressed by her performance. With admiration for the both of them, I told them to return to their places.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as the celebration was over, Zegion and Apito returned to their home in the labyrinth and became cocoons. With that, they would smoothly complete their evolution. Apito consumed the gift from Zegion along with the souls of her dependents and subordinate bugs. Through that she received an enormous amount of energy in her body. As a result, her flesh collapsed, and she was reborn with a stronger and more battle-ready body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito was reborn, and with the Unique Skill &lsquo;Queen Worship&rsquo; that she had acquired, she managed to create as many as nine insect-type majins, each with the characteristics of multiple types of bugs. The Unique Skill &lsquo;Queen Worship&rsquo; was the ability to take in the ecology of the bugs she had eaten and produce them as majin. In the future, a swarming community of majin would be formed on this floor. Apito would reign as the true queen. Apito was both a member of the &lsquo;Elite Ten&rsquo; and a follower of Zegion. Therefore, Zegion would not be shy about pouring favor upon Apito. Thus, it was understandable that Apito evolved abnormally.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if Apito, the recipient of the gift, had evolved to such a great extent, Zegion was no exception. Although his physical strength had evolved, the amount of magicules in his body surpassed that of an awakened Clayman. However, there was one Skill acquired by evolution that was even more problematic. While Apito&rsquo;s &lsquo;Queen Worship&rsquo; skill was an amazing power in its own right, and also possessed such a broken performance that it could be compared to the great sin skills, Zegion&rsquo;s power was completely different. He had acquired the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Illusion King Mephisto&rsquo;&mdash;a true ultimate power. As a disciple of Veldora, he had obtained a Skill that was truly worthy of him. With this power, Zegion was the undisputed king of the labyrinth. A paradise of bugs created by Apito. As king and queen, Zegion and Apito would establish their absolute position.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Adalmann had lots of faith in me and was a bit of a</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">well, he was a huge nutcase. If I&rsquo;m being honest, he was like a Diablo of sorts. Although, it was because of this that he was able to use &lsquo;holy magic&rsquo;, so it wasn&rsquo;t all bad&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalmann was also a good friend of Master Gadra, and it was said that they used to work together on various studies in the past. That&rsquo;s probably why he was able to create the Extra Skill &lsquo;Holy-Demonic Reversal&rsquo; to eliminate his weak points. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it before, but perhaps he was a kind of genius. It sounds strange for someone without a brain to be so smart, but if it is a monster you&rsquo;re talking about, then it makes sense. Some monsters even possess arithmetic circuits in their astral and spiritual bodies, giving them the ability to think without their bodies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then there were even some psychics who thought not with their brains but with their hearts. Shion and her group that had acquired &lsquo;perfect memory&rsquo; were brought to mind. That was merely a reproduction of memories, but if they developed and continued to think with their souls and astral bodies, they would be released from their lifespans and be called mental organisms. In this case, almost all physical attacks would not cause any fatal injuries, and even if they lost their bodies, they would be able to regenerate. They were no longer under any danger unless they were attacked by special attacks or by weapons of legendary-grade or higher.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the case of Adalmann, he had not yet reached that point. The wight king was a spiritual monster, but he was bound by the yoke of his body. Because his spiritual body contained the thinking circuit, life span had nothing to do with Adalmann. Even so, he could not reach the point where he could continue to exist as long as he had a soul and an astral body. Although he was as close and existence to a spiritual life form as possible, he was not immortal. Such was the nature of his existence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the same was true for Albert, the &lsquo;death paladin&rsquo;, along with the death dragon. They had learned to be prudent enough to fight while covering their weak points. Adalmann&rsquo;s specialty was long-range attacks with magic. He supported Albert, who was the vanguard of the group, while also providing magical support. The Death dragon attacked from the sky, and when Albert was exhausted or damaged, it immediately took his place as a wall. This coordination was their winning formula for battle. To defeat this team, a special means of attack was necessary.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this time, the opponent was just too bad. In this world, there was always someone better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As was the case with Hinata&rsquo;s &lsquo;Holy Spirit Armor&rsquo;, a master who can handle legendary-grade weapons can cut off any kind of attribute. Even if they were immortal, it did not matter. Hakurou was an example. Hakurou would be able to freely use the legendary-grade sword that I gave him as a prize. Doing so would greatly increase his strength. And while such a person would be good as an ally, this time, the enemy possessed a legendary-grade sword. Moreover, the user was of the highest military force of the Imperial Guard&mdash;the top ranks of the Imperial Guardians.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Albert&rsquo;s sword, though a failure forged by Kurobee, was a unique-grade sword. However, the enemy&rsquo;s sword was of legendary-grade. The reason why Albert had been able to defeat the opponent even though he was fighting with inferior quality weapons was because his skill-level was superior. In the end, Albert&rsquo;s sword was shattered and his team lost because of it, but it would be wrong to blame Albert for this. Rather, he should be praised for fighting such a great battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Although the results were unfortunate, you guys fought very well. Especially you Albert, your swordsmanship was one of the best I have ever seen!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am deeply honored.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Adalmann, you too. Before I knew it, you mastered all of the magic I taught you. I feel that I have something to learn after witnessing your devotion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was not planning to follow his example though because it would be too much of a pain in the ass. I had no desire to do research unless it was something that interested me. However, I had an excellent partner, Wisdom King Raphael-san, in my place, and Adalmann&rsquo;s research results would be useful in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How can that be? I, for one, am not even a whisper close to the fullness of Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s wisdom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not mine, but Wisdom King Raphael-san&rsquo;s, right? Well, I wasn&rsquo;t going to point out anything though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so modest. Adalmann, I will give you greater strength. I hope you will use this defeat as a springboard towards even greater growth!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am so grateful for your kind words to a defeated person like me, and I will do my utmost to make it up to you. I, Adalmann, would be willing to die for you, offering my withered body and broken bones.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalmann said that with tears in his eyes. I wish he would stop talking so much about unsettling things like &lsquo;breaking his bones&rsquo; and &lsquo;offering his flesh and blood&rsquo;. In fact, Adalmann had initially refused to accept when I told him that I was going to help him evolve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Rimuru-sama, unlike the rest of you, I am a defeated person. I cannot forgive myself. I am not sure that I, an incompetent person, could reach the same level of awakening as Rimuru-sama expects&hellip; I hope to be given the honor of reaching a higher level once I am given the next opportunity to make a difference!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was Adalmann&rsquo;s argument. I managed to convince him by persuading and quieting him down. To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t even expect too much from him in the first place. Even when Shinji and his group attacked up to the 60th floor, I had thought that Adalmann and his group would be defeated. But looking at them now, they have grown far beyond my expectations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Krishna and the others were just a bad match for them this time. And so, I awarded the souls to Adalmann, with the hopes that he would work hard in moderation. This was a big deviation from the original plan, but the labyrinth would be the last line defense from now on. It was important to strengthen our defenses, so I asked Adalmann to evolve as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">All of our important research facilities were located in the labyrinth, and if the time came, the capital could be isolated in the labyrinth. I had no idea how convenient this would eventually be when I first invited Ramiris.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">It was as if the labyrinth that we thought of as our playground had become a mighty fortress before we even realized it. All of this was thanks to Ramiris and Veldora. I called out to Adalmann, remembering to thank him as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You lamented that your work was not good enough, but I still appreciate your work. Prove me right with your future endeavors!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes! I will surely live up to your expectations!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalmann&rsquo;s evolution had begun. As it was in my case, he appeared to be suffering from an irresistible sleepiness. I felt bad to make him endure, so I quickly proceeded with the ritual.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I believe you. Then, from this day forth, you shall take the name &lsquo;Gehenna Lord&rsquo;. And you will live up to that name from now on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, by you will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whew! It&rsquo;s really exhausting using such dignified language. By the way, it was also hard to come up with all these titles. I didn&rsquo;t sleep all night. Granted, I had been idle with too much free time and didn&rsquo;t even need sleep, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyway, I decided to give Adalmann the title of a &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;, which was the highest rank amongst my subordinantes. There may be more of them in the future, but for now he was one of only twelve lords. As a powerful and influential executive, Adalmann&rsquo;s presence would surely increase. If he got the chance to do so, that is.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalmann was not the only one who played an active role. Albert was kneeling next to Adalmann, who was currently trying to resist sleep. Behind him, a death dragon was crouching down with its huge frame shrunken. Since gifts would be given to both of them, it was unlikely that I would have much time to talk with them. Albert would be given a weapon to replace his broken sword. He was already able to use the sword with an overwhelming skill-level, so it would be a great help to him if he was given the right equipment. Since that was the case, I thought that it would be better to give him Kurobee&rsquo;s masterpiece.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amongst the spoils of war seized from the Imperial Army, there were legendary-grade weapons. Moreover, the grand general Calgurio had held a very rare mythical-grade weapon. This mythical-grade was too good to be displayed without being used. I tried to leave it to Kurobee, but Kurobee refused to accept it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I can now create mythical-grade weapons by myself!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was convinced that this was indeed true. Benimaru&rsquo;s &lsquo;Red Lotus&rsquo; was reforged by Kurobee&rsquo;s hands to be as good as a mythical-grade. Convinced of this, I did not give him the weapon that I had now. In that case, who would be the right person to wield it? As one could see from Calgurio, merely being awakened did not make one a true master of a mythical-grade. Mythical-grade equipment will choose its own owner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">I understood that this was the case without analyzing it. I felt that mythical-grade equipment was a kind of &lsquo;tsukumogami&rsquo;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c14">. The magical steel had evolved into hihiirokane over a long period of time, and so, the owner had to be worthy of it to be able to wield it. This was exactly the kind of thing that a person with a long lifespan could only dream of. A noble soul that had become a dead spirit and was exposed to endless hardships, but nevertheless did not lose his skill-level as a Paladin. He had then evolved into a &lsquo;death paladin&rsquo; with an endless lifespan. Albert had studied hard and gained sword skills comparable to Hakurou&rsquo;s. Wouldn&rsquo;t he be the perfect person to handle this equipment?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what I thought. Besides, all the other executives had their own favorite weapons. There are even those who had a trusting relationship with Kurobee, and they did not want to carry any other weapons but those made by Kurobee. Others, like Diablo and the Three demon girls, used their own &lsquo;Matter Creation&rsquo; skill to make their weapons into tangible objects. The performance of those weapons were proportional to the skill-level of the owner, and they had at least legendary-grade defense. There was no need for them to own existing armor. Some, like Shion, had constantly poured mana into their weapons with love and affection for a long time. Perhaps because of this, Shion&rsquo;s favorite sword have become &lsquo;Hercules Ex&rsquo;, a legendary-grade weapon that prioritized destructive power. That said, didn&rsquo;t that weapon break?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought it was cut in half during the fight with Razul, but now it was back together again. That right, just like its owner Shion herself, even her beloved sword was revived like a phoenix. I was more stunned than surprised. And I was also a little scared. Shion seemed to have a love for cooking, but&hellip;what kind of ingredient is that?! Shion said that her so-called love had such an effect that it could revive even a broken sword. Just thinking about a dish infused with that kind of love&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">I had a dangerous feeling that I was going to have to think more about this in future, but I decided to just return to the task at hand. Now that I knew that compatibility with the equipment is also an important factor, there was no need to give the other subordinates new weapons now.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">This alone was a good enough reason, but the final push came from Wisdom King Raphael-san. It assured me that Albert was the best person to give this mythical-grade weapon to. I nodded my head without any doubts and decided to give it to Albert as a reward. Thus, Albert&rsquo;s prize was a set of mythical-grade equipment. It was full-plate armor, including a longsword and a kite shield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Albert, your swordsmanship is excellent. In recognition of your skill, I will give you these. Keep up the good work and help Adalmann!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As you wish!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time I called out to him, Shuna pushed a wagon with a set of equipment in front of him. She handed it to Albert. Albert shivered nervously as soon as he saw it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Th-This is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Albert was astonished, probably because he noticed its performance at first glance. It was no wonder. It was one of the few remaining pieces remaining in existence which had been handed down from mythical times. It was the highest honor for a knight to handle the best armor in the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be able to use it, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I won&rsquo;t let you say no. Under the pressure of my gaze, Albert became fired up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course! I will surely live up to the expectations of Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Albert replied in high spirits. He seemed to be full of enthusiasm, and I felt relieved. Then, as soon as Albert touched it, the mythical-grade equipment wrapped itself around Albert&rsquo;s body naturally. He seemed to have been recognized as the master of the armor. There was only one miscalculation. The performance of the mythical-grade equipment, now freed by its true master, was far beyond what I had expected. Albert had become as good as an incarnated spiritual organism whenever he was equipped with the mythical-grade equipment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ability to temporarily transform a physical person into a spiritual life form&mdash;this was the true power hidden within mythical-grade equipment. A spiritual life-form was, so to speak, a god-like existence with no lifespan. Veldora is like that, and I am like that, so to speak. There was nothing tangible about it, but it was definitely like immortality. Immortality is definite, and its nature is quite inexorable. Aside from conditions such as the destruction of the heart core or loss of magicules, it felt as if there was no way someone like that could die.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, a spiritual life form had no life span, was unaffected by any abnormalities, and could overcome death with just the power of will. I was convinced that mythical-grade equipment had a tremendous performance because it could raise someone to the same level as such a supernatural being, even if only temporarily. At the same time, I could understand the reason why Wisdom King Raphael-san had recommended Albert. Benimaru had evolved into a spiritual life form on his own, and Ranga and Shion were similar&hellip;no, rather, I was pretty sure that they would be similar. Gabil and Geld were not quite there yet, but I think that giving them mythical-grade equipment would not change their current conditions. Certainly, Albert was the right choice. It was like a match made in heaven, that&rsquo;s how I felt.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalmann&rsquo;s pet dragon couldn&rsquo;t be forgotten either. Because the death dragon had been working so hard, I decided that I would reward it in some way. I was wondering what I should do, but now I had thought of an answer. A name. &lsquo;Naming&rsquo; is the best way to make a monster happy. It is a dangerous thing to do, but now I had Wisdom King Raphael-san with me. I&rsquo;m sure it would keep things safe and adjust the outflow of magicules.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Proposal. In this case, there is already a bond between the individual Adalmann and the death dragon. Rather than creating a &lsquo;Soul Corridor&rsquo;, it is recommended to use the method of &lsquo;Naming&rsquo; by consumption of souls.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm? This was an unexpected suggestion from Wisdom King Raphael-san. By the way, how much soul is consumed in this case?</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. 5,000. Do you want to do it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">YES/NO&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it&rsquo;s only 5,000, then that is much more secure and reliable. Wisdom King Raphael-san said that it had analyzed the souls of &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; to convert them into magicules. It assured me that I would be safe. Okay, then let&rsquo;s go with that! I stood in front of the death dragon and patted its head. It seemed quite nervous, and although it looked quite scary, it was actually quite a cute guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I must reward you as well. So, from now on, you are Wenti, the &lsquo;Hell Dragon King&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After saying that, I consumed the souls and Named it. In that moment, a dramatic change occurred. The death dragon&rsquo;s huge frame of more than 20 meters became smaller and smaller until it transformed into a beautiful woman wearing a dark-colored robe.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="death dragon looking less dead" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wondered what this was, but I still wasn&rsquo;t letting my guard down. I guess with monsters, all things are possible. I&rsquo;ve been there and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot. The truths I have learned thus far kept me from panicking in the moment. I maintained my unwavering attitude of &lsquo;of course this is what should happen&rsquo;, without showing my panic. I&rsquo;m still trying very hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, my beautiful, beloved god! I am so moved by your blessings given even to my lowly self!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Uh, yeah. Of course I knew she could speak fluently. And all I&rsquo;ve given her is a name. Well, there was also the gift from Adalmann. I think she seems to be misunderstanding. I hope she doesn&rsquo;t get the wrong idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;O-oh, good for you, Death</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">no, Wenti!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahhh, my master. God has not forsaken me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, this is the result of our faith.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What a beautiful love between lord and slave. It feels like I&rsquo;m being left on the sidelines, but I&rsquo;m happy for them. Thus, the reward ritual given to Adalmann and the others was successfully completed.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so, &lsquo;Naming&rsquo; by consuming souls is very convenient. Originally, if I tried naming upper class monsters of the dragon lord class, I didn&rsquo;t know how many magicules I would lose. Even with Wisdom King Raphael-san, there was a limit to the amount of magicules I had. All of the magicules I had been accumulating through &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; had been used up by naming Testarossa and others. There was the method of relying on Veldora, but he seemed to be very reluctant to do so. It was hard to get him to change his mind, so I decided that would be a last resort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naming without any reserves can be a problem if it makes me fall into a low-level active state (sleep mode). Now that my total amount of magicules had increased, I didn&rsquo;t know how much time it would take me to recover. This was wartime. It would have normally been impossible to take such a risky bet. However, it was not a problem this time. Earlier, I had been wondering how I should thank Ramiris, but if I did this, I think she would be happy about it, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Basically, I came up with the idea of giving names to the four dragon lords under Ramiris. Even if they had no connection with me, they could still be named in this way. It was thanks to Wisdom King Raphael for coming up with this idea. I had enough souls in my possession, so there should be more than 20,000 souls left. In the first place, I was only able to secure such a large number of souls thanks to the cooperation of Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Ramiris had told me, &ldquo;I have no use for souls, so I don&rsquo;t need them,&rdquo; and she gave them all to me. I still felt bad about that, so this seemed to be a good idea. I hope she will be pleased with it. I would remember to talk to her later.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

The celebration was now at its final stage, and only two problem children remained. Needless to say, they were the first and second secretaries&mdash;Shion and Diablo. From what I had seen so far, I was convinced that there was no danger of them storming out. However, I still had to be on guard. After all, this was Shion and Diablo we&rsquo;re talking about. It was not an understatement to say that they were the two most dangerous. If both of them began rampaging at the same time, the damage would be enormous. And currently, the leaders were not in a reliable state. For these reasons, I would start with Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shion, you are appointed as the &lsquo;War Lord&rsquo;. Hopefully from today onwards, you will act with more composure than ever before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course! There is no woman in the world as calm and mature as me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Uh, that, just who are you talking about? You seem to be talking about yourself, but your self-esteem is way too high! I was impressed that Shion had learned to control herself recently, but she still had a long way to go. I should keep an eye on her for the long haul.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it as is, so don&rsquo;t lose control. Consult closely with those around you, and protect us all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After I said that, I gave Shion the souls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;And then, huh? To my surprise, there was no change at all. Shion looked at me with a puzzled look on her face. We stared at each other for a while, but there was still no sign of change. Was it a dud? This made me feel like I wasn&rsquo;t rewarding her, and it was becoming very awkward. I was suddenly in a crisis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, I had nothing else prepared. I wondered what to do, but then a surprising phenomenon occurred. The &lsquo;Yomigaeri&rsquo; fell asleep, while Shion did not change at all. And among the members of the mysterious Shion fan club there were a few who seemed to be having a hard time staying awake. It appeared that all of them were given some kind of gift, though it differed depending on the individual. Shion herself seemed to be fine, but that in itself was strange. There was no point in thinking about it too deeply, right? I guess this kind of thing just happened because they were direct subordinates of Shion. For this reason, it seemed better to leave this whole Shion ordeal alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, Shion, if you feel something is wrong with your body, please let me know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes! By the way, Rimuru-sama, I too, like Gobta, would like a special right&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion began saying something like that, fidgeting. Well, yeah. The ritual was done properly, but it felt to me that this was nothing more than giving a title. Some would say it is enough, but in Shion&rsquo;s case, she didn&rsquo;t need a new weapon&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like Gobta, huh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay. In that case, let&rsquo;s teach you how to make a special dish!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? So you agree that I am a better cook than Shuna-sama&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Absolutely not!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How on earth can someone come to such an impossible conclusion? Shuna, who had been listening beside me, was aghast, but then she suddenly got into a good mood when I immediately denied it. Shion seemed to be dissatisfied with my denial, but when I whispered to her that I would expand the kitchen as well, she nodded her head in satisfaction and went back to the line. She was an easy gal to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Shion&rsquo;s subordinates, the &lsquo;Yomigaeri&rsquo;, had evolved in an interesting way. They had become some type of spiritual life form. It was interesting to note that unlike a demon, the Yomigaeri all had their own bodies. They had physical bodies, but they were similar to the demon race. More importantly, they had not lost the ability to mate. They had been reborn into a completely new species. In other words, they were something like a new race of death oni. It seems that the oni factor of Shion manifested more strongly, and their power greatly increased. Some of them had even acquired the Extra Skill &lsquo;Divine Force&rsquo;, which was a physical enhancement system. However, they did not have horns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although their magicule count was lower than that of the Hiryuu, it was difficult to judge which of the two was stronger considering their immortality. No one would believe me if I told them that these guys were once hobgoblins. Indeed, monsters have such a mysterious biology. Shion&rsquo;s ritual ended in this way, though it was surprising that she did not change.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Problematic Diablo. He had been fidgeting with impatience for a long time now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&lsquo;Is it my turn now? How about now?&rsquo;</span><span class="c14">&mdash;his smile had been giving off that feeling, as if in anticipation. To be honest, it was more likely for Diablo to go on a rampage if the ceremony was canceled rather than losing control after awakening. I could say with certainty that if anybody interrupted this, their lives would be lost. All right then, let&rsquo;s get started.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Diablo-kun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have a bad feeling about this. Without a doubt, this evolution would make him one of the strongest in the monster country. Not only would he be the most powerful among my subordinates, but he&rsquo;d definitely be more powerful than me. He had mentioned himself that he couldn&rsquo;t beat Zegion, but he had probably been bound by certain conditions. The proof was that he had single-handedly conquered Jiwu and Bernie, who were quite strong opponents themselves. As powerful as Zegion was, Diablo gave off the impression of being the most superior. In other words, Diablo was still the strongest among my subordinates. If Diablo was really serious, he could probably be stronger than me even as it is now. In fact, the person I was when I first awakened was simply no match for the person I am now&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be interesting to see how Diablo would evolve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are deserving of the title &lsquo;Magic Lord&rsquo;. I hope you will continue to lead the demons as my sword in the future as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Especially those three demon girls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, leave it to me, Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Please, I&rsquo;m serious. I nodded and then performed the ritual on Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;And then the devil was born.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In an instant, the evolution appeared to be over. I thought it was a dud like with Shion, but it turned out that wasn&rsquo;t the case. It was just that he had controlled all of the energy perfectly and did not show it at all. As expected of Diablo&mdash;he was brilliant. Diablo had evolved and become one of the most powerful beings on earth. A portion of his power also flowed through the newly created Soul Corridor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is bad, this is really bad. I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine the upper limit of his power. Now that Benimaru and Shion had yet to evolve, he had become the most powerful being under my control. No, on the contrary&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">He was on par with myself in terms of total magicule count, and considering his accumulated skill-level and experience, it felt like I was no longer a match for him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">Sure enough, my bad premonition seemed to be coming true. That said, I had a feeling things would turn out this way, so I was not at all upset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excellent evolution, Diablo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is a great honor to receive your compliments, Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s it, huh? His personality was the same as before. It would have been interesting to see if he had wanted to overcome the situation here. If that had happened, I was planning to fight seriously, though that was a secret of course. Diablo, however, appeared to be trying to get a new Skill, even though his evolution was complete.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s just that I realized the usefulness of an Ultimate Skill in the last battle. I had ignored this power in the past because Guy kept bragging about it, but now I&rsquo;ve changed my mind and have decided to use whatever I can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;O-oh, I see&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is this guy an idiot? This is called being a smartass, right? There seem to be a lot of that type hanging around me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take this opportunity to learn it so that I can brag about it the next time I see him. Kufufufu.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A-ahhh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hates Guy bragging about it, but doesn&rsquo;t mind doing it himself&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, whatever. One only has to look at Diablo&rsquo;s attitude up until now to understand that he&rsquo;ll be selfish towards anyone but me. Even I could understand that without relying on Wisdom King Raphael-san. Anyway, I won&rsquo;t have to worry about it, since Guy would be the victim. As long as I don&rsquo;t get involved in it, I can turn a blind eye. Diablo has maintained the same attitude as before, and at this rate, it seems that my worries about him were unfounded. He has completely controlled the evolution, and I would continue to rely on him as a competent subordinate.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Incidentally, there was another fact that would later come to light. An evolutionary gift from Diablo was given to Venom, his second-in-command, along with a hundred demons under his command. However, though this was only my intuition, I had a suspicion that Diablo focused his energy on the gifts. I didn&rsquo;t know if such a thing was possible or not, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Diablo could do it. Diablo would have thought that strength is not something that is given, but something that is acquired by oneself. But then again, Venom also seemed to have something to offer. He had evolved properly and become a demon peer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That said, he was not as good as Testarossa nor was he as intimidating as Moss and Veyron. It would not be reasonable for a person who had reigned as the strongest for a long time to be defeated by a newcomer, right? Even though they were the same class of demon peers, the difference in &lsquo;status&rsquo; was quite apparent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for sure. I&rsquo;m just a newcomer, and I haven&rsquo;t even lived a hundred years. I&rsquo;m not even worth being compared to them.&rdquo; </span><span class="c14">Venom himself had said as such.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Venom appeared to be a special individual, belonging to a late modern species with little experience. There was a chance he was a reincarnated person with a strange fate, since he was born with a Unique Skill. He has no memory of his previous life, but sometimes he remembers words that he should not know. He had said that he often felt a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu whenever he saw things having to do with Japan. Well, if he really was a &lsquo;reincarnated person&rsquo;, it made sense that he was special.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That said, Venom knew his place. He did not get carried away nor did he look down on his colleagues even if he had evolved to the same level as Testarossa and her colleagues. He seemed to have realized the difference in his abilities after observing his evolved power. For a demon, experience was more important than the amount of magicules. While I was in the midst of thinking that this kid was pretty good, he told me a story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">&ldquo;Well, actually, I challenged Diablo-sama before, and now I&rsquo;ve been taught the true difference between our abilities ever since!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He said this in such a cheerful way, but he&rsquo;s just an idiot, isn&rsquo;t he? This kind of thing is typical among Diablo&rsquo;s inner circle, so it seems that there was a reason he liked him. But even so, it turned out to be a good thing. He learned from his experience and wouldn&rsquo;t make the same mistake again. Even if he ever did get carried away, Diablo would definitely take care of it. Diablo had no mercy on those who did not know their place, even if it was those under his command. Venom seemed to be a man who could learn from his mistakes.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then there were the others who received gifts. In fact, these guys were originally still in the process of constructing their bodies in the culture capsules. One hundred such bodies were born as devil chevaliers. Devil chevaliers were those who had gained power comparable to that of greater majins, though not as powerful as archdemons. They had become so fierce that they could slaughter greater demons with a single blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To put it simply, they were a super high-spec existence, yet Diablo was not interested in them in the slightest. He left all of them as Venom&rsquo;s subordinates. He gave priority to being able to move freely in protecting his position under my direct control. It was at that moment that I was convinced that he had not changed after all. Diablo was still Diablo, even if he had evolved and surpassed me.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I was glad that things ended peacefully. However, the victory party was still going on. I called out to those who had done well, and congratulated them for their efforts.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">And so things continued until only those who were sober were celebrating. The all-inclusive banquet would be held the next time. While looking forward to that time, I would enjoy today&rsquo;s feast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, Jaine-san and the two members of the &lsquo;Two Wings&rsquo; had left. They told me with apologetic faces that they had some urgent business to attend to and had to hurry back as soon as the ceremony was over. I hope that they will take their time to join in the celebration next time. I was also worried about those who were getting drunk at the party.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;m not a good match for Benimaru-sama anyway. I knew that from the beginning!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gobua-dono, you are beautiful too. Just look at me, I was killed by Alvis-sama, my idol. Beastmen are those who like the strong. They want someone who&rsquo;s as good as or better than themselves as a mate. And if someone is strong, he can have as many women as he wants. That&rsquo;s how it is supposed to be, yet I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Phobio-dono, you are already strong enough. If I were stronger, I would have been able to get between those two&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You may just call me Phobio. You are also strong enough. It&rsquo;s just, you know, it&rsquo;s the wrong comparison. I can&rsquo;t beat them either, so there&rsquo;s nothing to do about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Phobio-dono&hellip;no, Phobio. In that case, please just call me Gobua.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahhh, Gobua.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Phobio&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hey, hey, hey, I can&rsquo;t watch this anymore! Look, I&rsquo;m an adult, so I won&rsquo;t get angry, but this is not the place for you guys to have a lovey-dovey date! That said, I guess it&rsquo;s not a bad thing if two rejected people hit it off with each other. Love really is a mysterious thing. I decided to take things as is. And so, the party continued in full swing, and the night passed happily&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, new &lsquo;lords&rsquo; were born in our country. Although they could not call themselves demon lords according to the regulations, nine of them were in fact equivalent to awakened demon lords. In addition, there were three &lsquo;primordials&rsquo;. Unless something unexpected happens, we should be able to cope with any unexpected situation. Since I have given the title of &lsquo;lord&rsquo; to these twelve, I will call them collectively &lsquo;Twelve Chaos Guardian Lords&rsquo;. Although some of them also had titles such as the &lsquo;Four Heavenly Kings&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Elite Ten&rsquo;, the official title of &lsquo;Lord&rsquo; takes precedence over them. This is because, unlike the other positions, there was no plan to replace its members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In effect, a &lsquo;Lord&rsquo; is a permanent executive since they transcend life span. In the future, it would be ideal for them to be separated from the day-to-day management and to be active only in wartime or in emergency situations. Rigurd and Rigur, as well as Gobta and Myourmiles, and a number of others, were excellent executives, but they had their own life expectancy. There was still a need to consider generational subordinates and the permanent subordinates differently. It was not an immediate issue, but it would be an issue to be discussed in the future. The one I was concerned about was Gobta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was still a top executive, and he was surprisingly resourceful and strong in battle. To be honest, his &lsquo;Magic Wolf Unification&rsquo; with Ranga was a cheat move. Ranga would become stronger after this evolution, but I was sure Gobta would be able to handle it. Gobta really was a special kind of being. The evolution from naming him had not changed his appearance. What he said in his sleep about evolution through talent might even hold some weight. And with his reward, Gobta&rsquo;s position had officially been established. Gobta&rsquo;s position of being closer to me than other executives had brought him much attention. Perhaps by accident, it was the best reward of all. I thought this as I looked at my friends who were all enjoying the banquet.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On another note. Apparently, after the world heard about the events of that day, I became known as &lsquo;Chaos Creator&rsquo; Rimuru. Because I was conscious of the many things I had done, I decided to accept this new nickname.</span></p><p class="c17" id="h.1fob9te"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image26.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c19" id="h.qmqevtr6bzgv"><span class="c10">Interlude 1</span></h2><p class="c35"><span class="c20 c14">The Outrageous Victory Celebration</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Jaine attended the celebration and witnessed the shocking spectacle. Demon Lord Rimuru had evolved his majin followers one by one, turning them into &lsquo;True Demon Lords&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Oh no, this&hellip;this can&rsquo;t be! I&rsquo;m not dreaming, am I?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jaine was so surprised she couldn&rsquo;t even make a sound. She knew that Demon Lord Rimuru was trouble, but this was so ridiculous and unrealistic that it was far worse than the worst Jaine could have imagined. Jaine&rsquo;s purpose in coming here had been to ask Rimuru how he was going to handle the &lsquo;primordials&rsquo;. Jaine herself believed in Rimuru. But a &lsquo;primordial&rsquo; was not an existence that could just be taken easily. Once unleashed, they could disrupt the balance of power in the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in fact, this war had proven just that. The elites of the Imperial Army, 940,000 of them, were annihilated without a trace. It was fortuitous that Rimuru was on their side, but there was no guarantee that they would be able to maintain that relationship for a long time to come. Therefore, Jaine came here as a representative, to check on the situation and to see how things were going. Rimuru&rsquo;s reaction when she greeted him was natural and he did not seem to have changed since their previous meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jaine then complained a little harshly. She intended to find out what Rimuru was thinking by observing how he reacted to her complaints. The result was a flop. In response to Jaine&rsquo;s anger, Rimuru not only showed his remorseful attitude, he even honestly apologized, saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Then, Rimuru&rsquo;s explanation of the situation, which could only be called an excuse, revealed that it was Diablo who had done this all on his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is this Diablo the same as the Black Primordial (Noir)?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, it seems so. I didn&rsquo;t know that either, but I don&rsquo;t know why he&rsquo;s so close to me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After saying that, Rimuru nodded his head in baffled agreement. It didn&rsquo;t look like he was lying, and she could only understand that he had decided to take in the demons without knowing what they were. Jaine&rsquo;s life experience was also telling her that this was not an act. If so, there was nothing more Rimuru could do, even if she complained further. More importantly, Rimuru himself was not at fault. There had been a fear that he might become arrogant with his power, but Jaine was relieved to find out that she had worried too much. This was not good. At that time, she should have given him more of a stern warning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Even if the Primordials becoming his followers was a force majeure, it&rsquo;s just plain malicious to mass-produce &lsquo;True Demon Lords&rsquo;!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, most likely, Rimuru truly had no malicious intent. Perhaps he was convinced that he could handle any problems on his own if something came up, just did not intend to cause trouble for Jaine and the others. Normally, such an approach would make one suspect a threat, but he must have had no intention to do so. Perhaps, he might have even decided that he could not hide anything more since he had been so much criticized for the &lsquo;primordial&rsquo; situation. The disclosure of information was made with sincerity and based on trust. If so, Jaine was also partly to blame. She should have taught Rimuru some common sense earlier. Whether that was possible or not, it was too late now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">This world&hellip;the balance of power in this world is&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jaine almost fainted as she thought about what would happen next. The celebration went on without incident, and one by one, his subordinates were gaining strength. A systematic influx of power was observed in them. There was no doubt that Tempest&rsquo;s strength had increased significantly in just the past few hours. A huge military state was about to be born in the center of the Great Jura Forest, far beyond the threat of the Empire of the East. Realizing this, Jaine regretted having not dealt with this problem earlier. However, even if she had those thoughts&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">There&rsquo;s nothing we can do. Even last time, the conclusion was that &lsquo;There is nothing we can do, so there is no point in thinking about it.&rsquo; King Gazel also decided to put this matter on hold, but there will be no solution in the future. In that case&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The war with the Empire was not yet over. The Imperial Army was still deployed, and Rimuru had been in contact with them. The next plan was to conspire to attack the capital of the Empire at once. Jaine had come here in the first place for the purpose of arranging such a meeting. And yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">I&rsquo;ve never been so confused in my life. At this point, they&rsquo;re not even an Empire anymore. I must tell King Gazel that the True Demon Lord has been born!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, Jaine thought about pretending she hadn&rsquo;t noticed. It would be an escape from reality, but it also seemed like a good idea. However, she was the one who had pressed King Gazel a while ago as to why he had not told her about the &lsquo;primordials&rsquo;. Therefore, Jaine had no right to remain silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dolph, I&rsquo;m going back first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, why? The main purpose of coming, the meeting, is scheduled for tomorrow, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We would still save face if just you were to attend. I will return home by magic. I don&rsquo;t need an escort.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;O-okay&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph, who was unable to read the flow of mana, did not understand what had just happened in front of him. Jaine was a little envious of Dolph and felt depressed just thinking about the future.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Tempest, the land of monsters, was home to many powerful majins. They knew that, and had been in contact with some of them, Geld being the first. While acknowledging them as a threat, they were currently allies, so they did not believe there was a need to be so cautious. No matter how many greater majins there were, they could still match up. That&rsquo;s how they felt until now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What they had been ordered to do was to assess Tempest&rsquo;s strength. Now that they were at war with the Nasca Namrium Ulmeria United Eastern Empire, the largest and most powerful of the human nations, Rimuru&rsquo;s forces would probably suffer some damage. If this happened, then the construction of the sky city, which Frey was looking forward to, would be hampered. It was their mission to assess the damage and make predictions for the future. Naturally, this included the organization of reinforcements. However, it appeared that this was not necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Zero casualties?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it, but seeing your cheerful faces, I guess it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, an unexpected report was given. They had been glad to hear the news and joined in the victory party, but it was a huge miscalculation being shown an event that took them by surprise on the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. It is impossible that some of the executives have grown up to be as fierce as Frey-sama in such a short period of time&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;No, look over there&hellip;Demon Lord Rimuru is about to do something.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claire calmly pointed out to Lucia, who was upset to see those who had come up to the podium. What began next was the most appalling ritual that the two could have ever imagined. No, this was not the time to be dumbfounded. It was unrealistic to the point of wanting to give up thinking about it, but this was too serious a situation for them to make any judgments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;We have to report this to Frey-sama ASAP!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. Let&rsquo;s go home right away.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They communicated and quickly made a decision. And so they returned to report to Frey what had happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The location was the topmost floor of the temporary castle, in a corner of the keep which had not fully been furnished. Frey let out a long sigh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What in the world is that slime thinking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One person responded to her mutterings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, hey, what&rsquo;s going on? Your melancholy expression is beautiful, but a sigh doesn&rsquo;t suit you, does it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Karion. The two were now well acquainted with each other as Milim&rsquo;s assistants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be so sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What really happened? Are we fighting an uphill battle against the Imperial Army?&rdquo; Karion asked anxiously. Frey looked worried as she answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That would have been better. Then we wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about things and we could just send reinforcements right away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, what is it? Did that Rimuru guy do something terrible again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a moment of silence, Frey collected her thoughts and answered. Karion remained silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Karion, may I ask you something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calling Rimuru-sama, Milim-sama&rsquo;s best friend, &lsquo;that Rimuru guy&rsquo;, is not very nice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, come on, it&rsquo;s a little too late for that. Besides, you called that kid by his first name when you were with Milim, and you even called him &lsquo;that slime&rsquo; not too long ago!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you hear me? You&rsquo;re a bad person too. I won&rsquo;t say it in front of other people, so forget about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, but don&rsquo;t try to cover things up with a story. Just tell me what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, Frey let out a helpless sigh. Her fragrant breath tickled Karion&rsquo;s nostrils. Karion, who was pleased by this, looked at Frey with an expression saying that he was not going to be fooled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, all right. You won&rsquo;t be sorry you asked, will you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Depends on what it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t regret it. Don&rsquo;t take it all on yourself. Let me shoulder some of the burden too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. I like that about you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey felt her melancholy mood lift and she smiled. Then she told Karion a portion of the report she had received from the twins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious. It&rsquo;s impossible for those girls to lie to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, what is it? Seven demon lords were just born under Rimuru?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That seems to be the case.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So are those guys stronger than us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But&hellip;at the very least, they felt stronger than I am in the eyes of those girls.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before they evolved, they seemed to be as strong as Frey. But Demon Lord Rimuru had now done &lsquo;something&rsquo; to them, and the girls had sensed an overwhelming increase in their power. According to the report, some of them were still in the middle of their evolution, but it would not be long before their power would stabilize. The contents of the report were unacceptable, but that seemed acceptable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Are you kidding me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Karion, who heard the story from Frey, was speechless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Karion, do I look like I&rsquo;m joking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, those are the facts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion and Frey had never shown their full strength in front of their subordinates. However, even close subordinates could see the power of their masters to a certain extent. Even if it was only an estimate, it was information that could not be ignored. Moreover, there was no one under Frey who would ever offend her by making jokes or telling lies. Knowing this, Karion had no choice but to believe what he just heard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Just what the hell were Phobio and Alvis doing&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Phobio was not originally a man who could recognize his opponent&rsquo;s strength. Even if something unusual had happened in front of his eyes, he would not have noticed it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">&mdash;No, Alvis would have seen it. So then why didn&rsquo;t she report this to me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Karion was wondering about this, Frey told him something as if she had forgotten about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, by the way, Alvis-san, the leader of your group, is now engaged to Benimaru-dono, who is in charge of Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s group. If this international marriage succeeds, then it will contribute to the relationship between our two countries. Rimuru-sama has also approved it. I&rsquo;m very happy for them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She did it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis had approached Karion about this earlier. The advice he gave her was to &lsquo;take it by force&rsquo;. As a result, Alvis had won her prize. Karion grinned with pleasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But it looks like she&rsquo;s going to be the second wife.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Che, I thought she would be the first. Still, once she has a baby, it will be for our people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s vulgar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Frey, you&rsquo;re the only woman I&rsquo;ve ever loved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. My race is monogamous. We&rsquo;re the opposite of you, so it&rsquo;s not gonna work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The harpies were an almost exclusively female species that relied on the rare occurrence of a male form or the acceptance of powerful majin nymphs for diversity to sustain their race. For queens such as Frey, it was common practice to increase the number of her offspring by monogenesis. A husband was not a necessity. On the other hand, among the beastmen, it was common for a strong man to love more than one woman. The weak were weeded out, and the race became stronger. Both sides had the same purpose, however, they were not compatible with each other by any stretch of the imagination. That said, both Karion and Frey recognized each other&rsquo;s strength. Therefore, they maintained a dangerous relationship, like walking on a tightrope, tightly holding the last line of defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t seem to get a good answer from you for now, so I&rsquo;ll let this continue slowly. The real question is, what did that Rimuru guy do now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Putting the Alvis celebration on the back burner, Karion got down to business. Frey agreed with this sentiment. Although we have a good relationship with Rimuru and the others now, and we intend to maintain it, no one can be sure of the future. I wanted to know what happened, and if possible, find a way to achieve a higher level of success.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Clayman&rsquo;s ending comes to mind. He had been in a state of extraordinary power at that time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;According to Rimuru, that was an awakening.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you think caused it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph! It didn&rsquo;t look like that guy had any hidden power. That means he must have gotten his power in that moment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Souls.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4">&hellip;</span><span class="c14">Clayman said, &lsquo;By collecting souls, I will awaken as a &lsquo;True Demon Lord&rsquo;. If this is true, there&rsquo;s no way that Clayman wouldn&rsquo;t have collected souls beforehand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. So he used them to try to awaken.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think so. To be honest, I haven&rsquo;t killed many humans, so I&rsquo;ve never cared much about souls.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me too. Wars are fought with our own kind, other majin, or angels. Our country was wealthy, so we didn&rsquo;t care about the humans.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. But this does answer the question. Rimuru-sama apparently gained a lot of souls in this war. He must have given them to the majin under his control to awaken them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an exaggeration. As much as I hate the fact that a bunch of majin who became &lsquo;Demon Lord Seeds&rsquo; like us are under his control, I&rsquo;m more pissed off that they beat us to it. In that case, how many souls did Rimuru use?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion scratched his head and asked, and Frey turned her attention to the city under construction below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, by the way, I didn&rsquo;t mention the outcome of the war. Surprisingly, Tempest&rsquo;s army suffered zero damage. On the other side, the Empire lost 940,000 of their own people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m lying?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-no, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I also hoped that this report had been wrong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, Demon Lord Rimuru had obtained as many as 940,000 souls, so it would have been easy for him to awaken his seven subordinates. There was also the possibility that it was not just those seven who were awakened. According to the report, Benimaru, who was the general, did not show any changes, but only married two wives, Momiji and Alvis. However, there was no way Rimuru would not have given souls to Benimaru, his right hand man. It would be safer to assume that the evolution of Benimaru had been delayed for some reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, a one-sided victory with zero casualties. That&rsquo;s not even a war anymore. I would have raised the white flag long ago, but I wonder how the Empire will act.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous. I don&rsquo;t care about the Empire. The real question is, what should we do now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Exactly. I&rsquo;m just surrendering to Milim. I was afraid that asking for power might make her suspect treason, but now I&rsquo;ve been reminded that I don&rsquo;t need to worry about that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru brought his subordinates up to the same level as himself, right? Seeing him that way, I realized that Milim must be the same way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. Milim is not such a small being that she would make a fuss over our own awakenings.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right? Then why don&rsquo;t we just do as we please? We&rsquo;ve been a little too relaxed, but it&rsquo;s not too late. Let&rsquo;s aim for even higher things!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. I like that about you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey and Karion looked at each other. The atmosphere had just gotten pretty good, when&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wahahaha! Well said, guys! I may not be able to awaken my minions like Rimuru can, but I can train them! In the labyrinth, you won&rsquo;t have to worry about dying, so we can do this with all our might!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Milim intervened at the perfect moment.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="MILIM BEING CRINGE" src="images/image10.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Che, you&rsquo;re in the&mdash;Ah Milim!

That said, I have no intention to accompany you for your training&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion and Frey complained, but Milim did not listen to them. Milim&rsquo;s ears had an excellent function of shutting out any information that might be inconvenient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right then, I&rsquo;ll go ask Ramiris for help!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-Wait, wait! I didn&rsquo;t ask you to train me either!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milim! If you won&rsquo;t listen to me, I&rsquo;ll think of my own idea. I will leave all of your meals up to Midley-dono. Is that alright with you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey&rsquo;s comment stimulated Milim&rsquo;s sense of crisis and succeeded in stopping her. Karion, who was watching the event, praised Frey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-I get it. If you want to train, you can call me anytime.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. By the way, did you finish your homework?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-Well, you know, I heard something interesting, so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t done it yet, have you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ugh, now that the break is over, I&rsquo;ll go right back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s a good girl.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim returned to her homework, and Frey and Karion also succeeded in overcoming the crisis. However, their ambition for evolution continued to smolder in their hearts. Whether or not this ambition would ever be fulfilled was a question that remained to be answered.</span></p><p class="c17" id="h.3znysh7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image14.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c19" id="h.c0qtmwsf3cxm"><span class="c10">Chapter 2</span></h2><p class="c35"><span class="c14 c20">Future Plans</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Before I forgot, I decided to thank Veldora and Ramiris. The reward for Veldora was clothes. I thought it might be a little problematic since he was always wearing a cloak and no clothes on his upper body, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to mind. Perhaps he liked this kind of clothing so I took the opportunity to give him some clothes as a gift.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, Rimuru! My friend and ally! At last, you have noticed my feelings. I have always wanted to wear something nice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, no, you could have asked Shuna to get it for you right away, couldn&rsquo;t you? I mean, there were clothes that you could adjust the size by magic in the clothing store.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You fool. The only thing that will fit me is a one-of-a-kind, custom-made piece. And if it is made by you, my trusted friend, that means it&rsquo;s the best, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Uh, actually, I don&rsquo;t have any sense of style&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think Veldora overestimates me. Even my own clothes are just what people tell me to wear. Come to think of it, the same was true even in my previous life. I had the worst taste in everyday clothes. That&rsquo;s why I always wore suits. The rest of what I wore consisted of jerseys. Those were really nice. I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about getting them dirty, and they were the most relaxing thing in the world. I was surprised that Veldora was more pleased than I had expected. Veldora quickly and happily began to put on his clothes.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="NEW DRAGON PAJAMAS" src="images/image28.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-Well, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re happy. I look forward to your help again in the future!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm. Leave it to me. Kuahahaha!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Considering the profit margin, it turned out to be a ridiculously cheap reward. Well, some of the clothes were custom-made with luxurious materials, but still, what can I say&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, next time I have free time, I&rsquo;ll think of something else to thank him with. Regarding Veldora, I would just leave it for the future. Next up was Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ramiris, you also helped me this time. Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, you&rsquo;re being so cynical! I&rsquo;m indebted to you too! This is what we call mutual help!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris answered a little sheepishly. I was a bit embarrassed too, but it was important to express my gratitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, I wanted to give you a gift of gratitude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Did you make clothes for me like you did for Master?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to talk to Shuna about that. As for me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clothes for girls were out of my league. I&rsquo;d rely on Shuna for that, so I proposed &lsquo;Naming&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does that mean you can name my cute little dragon lords?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be the parent?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, yeah. Although I was surprised too, it didn&rsquo;t matter because it actually succeeded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At yesterday&rsquo;s celebration, my colleague Adalmann&rsquo;s pet, Wenti, was &lsquo;Named&rsquo;. Then it evolved and became able to change into a humanoid form and also to speak fluently. So, I was wondering if your dragon lords would be interested in this too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a surprise that Wenti turned into a human, but come to think of it, a dragon turning into a human seems pretty standard in stories. It was not completely unexpected. Therefore, there is a possibility that the four dragon lords under Ramiris would be able to turn into human forms, like Wenti. If so, that would increase her manpower, which would make Beretta&rsquo;s hardships less heavy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;m counting on you!&rdquo; Ramiris nodded happily. After obtaining her consent, I began the session.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you have any good names in mind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmmm, I&rsquo;ll just leave it all to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris was not good at coming up with names. If I left it to her, the dragons would end up like some fantasy game bosses&hellip;no wait, wouldn&rsquo;t that be okay?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Come to think of it, I was the boss, so I didn&rsquo;t need to worry about that. I asked Ramiris to gather the dragon lords in the King&rsquo;s Chamber of the Labyrinth. I looked at the dragon lords lined up in front of me and thought to myself that they too had suffered many defeats. However, they did their best, so I wanted to think of good names for them. A dragon lord possessed more magicules than an archdemon. However, since it hadn&rsquo;t been very long since Milim picked them up, the dragon lords here were not as strong in certain respects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they could evolve by naming, their intelligence would increase all at once. If so, they would become smarter and stronger than they are now. I should look at each one of them and think of a suitable name. Intuition was the key for this kind of thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Fire Dragon Lord was Euros, the &lsquo;Draconic Flamelord&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Ice Dragon Lord was Zephyrus, the &lsquo;Draconic Frostlord&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Wind Dragon Lord was Notos, the &lsquo;Draconic Skylord&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Earth Dragon Lord was Boreas, the &lsquo;Draconic Terralord&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I borrowed these names from Greek mythology. The names of the dragon lords were originally from the Greek gods who controlled the winds of the east, west, north, and south, but I thought it was suitable for these dragon lords. Naming the dragon lords was my own idea, but the soul connection would be formed with Ramiris. I was relieved to see that this was also a success. Thus, a soul connection was formed between Ramiris and the dragon lords. I hoped that they would continue to do their best as Ramiris&rsquo; official subordinates. So how was their evolution?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As expected, the dragon lords really could change into human-like forms. They were not completely humanoid, and they still had the characteristics of dragons remaining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Draconic Flamelord&rsquo; Euros was a beautiful woman with red hair. Her auburn skin was covered with a garb of dragon scales, and her tail appeared to be a whip of flame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Draconic Frostlord&rsquo; Zephyrus was a slender, handsome man. His graceful and gentle appearance combined with his long green hair might almost make one mistake him for a beautiful woman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Draconic Skylord&rsquo; Notos was a petite little girl. She looked pretty from a distance, but closer inspection revealed jagged teeth and fangs. She was a powerful creature whose strength was not commensurate with her mass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Draconic Terralord&rsquo; Boreas was a large, muscular man. He was covered with dragon scales and had spines all over his body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All four of them looked like the leaders of a secret society of evil, and their &lsquo;deformed beauty&rsquo; was a fusion of horror and beauty. Such a form was only a type of state change. They did not become dragonoids like Milim, but remained as dragon lords like before. In the end, a dragonoid is a spiritual being with a physical body, like an irregular form of a &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo;. Even if a dragon lord possesses strong power, as long as it is trapped in their own body, their power would be far from that of a &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo;, which was a perfect spiritual life form. Although there was no change in the race, evolution had succeeded without any problem. Moreover, they seemed to have succeeded in acquiring a more powerful mana than expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their total magicule counts were several times larger than before the evolution, and they appeared to have reached the level of an awakened Clayman. While not as good as a &lsquo;True Demon Lord&rsquo;, they were a wonderful evolution. I shuddered to think what would have happened if I had consumed my own magicules, when &lsquo;Naming&rsquo; alone showed such an increased rate. If I had not done what I did, I might have suffered irreparable damage. &lsquo;Naming&rsquo; was a terrible system, after all. I had used more than 5,000 souls, and I was reminded once again that monsters were not logical beings. But, well, it&rsquo;s only a loss if you care about it. Thus, the evolution of the dragon lords, which also served as a thank-you to Ramiris, was successfully completed.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, &lsquo;Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten&rsquo; were almost equal in terms of the amount of magicules. However, in terms of the unquantifiable fighting power, there appeared to be a big gap between them. Zegion was the leader, that went without saying. Compared to the other &lsquo;Elite Ten&rsquo;, the evolved dragon lords were still weaker. They had strong physical strength as monsters, along with the means to attack. They also possessed various kinds of magic. All of these alone were undoubtedly a mighty and powerful force. However, that could not be used against those who were skilled in battle of the same rank. It is because of their lack of combat experience that they were fundamentally low in skill-level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The dragon lords must have been defeated many times in this defensive battle, and must have felt very frustrated. As soon as they evolved and became able to speak human language fluently, they asked for more training. By transforming into humanoid form, the dragon lords were able to learn the skills of human combat. Then they realized that a refined art was stronger than the conventional fighting style of monsters. Instead of relying on physical attacks with their breath, claws, and fangs, they used magic and incorporated it into their fighting. Then, they learned how to fight as a human being and tried to incorporate it into actual combat. It was a remarkable development for them to come to this conclusion by their own thinking. The training offer was accepted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuahahaha! Leave it to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora, who was in a good mood after raising Zegion, agreed to train the dragon lords. Thus began the dragon lord cultivation training.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Later, some of the dragon lords appeared to be stronger in human form than in their original dragon form. That might seem to be a bit of a reversal, but since they had mastered the art of transforming their own claws and scales into weapons and armor, the result was probably justified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I did not learn about this until much later, but I had the feeling that it was only natural.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

They were shocked to know that they had been brought back to life by the demon lord. It was indescribable, but they somehow succeeded in accepting it. The question was, what position should they take from now on? They were still living in tents. Food had been arranged and was brought to them by monsters on a regular basis. No one complained, even if they were skeletons. The tents were lined up on a hillside where the grass and trees had withered away. Although the scenery was poor, it was neither hot nor cold, and the space was surprisingly comfortable. The ruins of the battlefield combined with the air of death and the rows of graves of the dead were nothing to be concerned about once one got used to them. That was because it would be strange to be afraid of the graves whose contents were always out and about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In short, it was an environment where they did not feel much dissatisfaction in their daily lives. According to the explanation, this place was located on the 70th floor in the labyrinth. The person who gave the explanation was a &lsquo;wight king&rsquo; named Adalmann, who was in charge of guarding the labyrinth. Since some of them had actually fought in the labyrinth, there was no one who doubted him. Adalmann was a good man and treated Calgurio and the others as proper prisoners of war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Since my god Rimuru-sama has brought you back to life, I must do as he wills. He is not the kind of person who would take away your life once he has given it, so you may take your time to think about what you should do in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalmann said as such, setting Calgurio and the others free. No one had ever suggested that they flee this hierarchy. They were already in god&rsquo;s hands. They realized this and decided to believe in Demon Lord Rimuru. Calgurio agreed with this decision, and he was also convinced that they would fail if they tried to escape. That is why he took Adalmann&rsquo;s words to heart and decided to call the upper management together for a meeting.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nearly one hundred officers gathered in the large tent used for military discussions. They were senior officers and some of the Empire&rsquo;s leading champions. Of course, they were now people without power&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, gentlemen. Let me first apologize to you. It is my incompetence that has brought this upon you. I am deeply sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Calgurio looked around at those gathered and bowed his head.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">The response was a unanimous denial.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you saying? We are just as guilty for not stopping you, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When the deputy said as such, the chiefs of staff nodded in agreement. The senior officers also said that Calgurio was not solely responsible. Krishna was the most evident.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree with everyone. We have incurred the wrath of god because of our stupidity. And by god&rsquo;s mercy, we have been given the opportunity to atone for our sins.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He regarded the imperial invasion itself as a sin. Calgurio agreed with him. They had been so overconfident with their own military power that they did not understand anything about their enemies. Looking back, Calgurio thought to himself of what a fool he had been. He also thought that his companions must feel the same way, and gave a smile as if in relief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you. I feel a little calmer now that you have said that. I promise to god that I will remember this feeling for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the mention of the word &lsquo;god&rsquo;, Calgurio&rsquo;s mind was filled with the image of the Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c9">Yes, for me, the god of the moment is now His Majesty Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Back in the Empire, there was no place for Calgurio. He would be blamed for the defeat and be executed before even waiting for a court-martial. He had no intention of evading the responsibility, but Calgurio did not think that he should throw away the life given to him by Rimuru for nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Well, I can take time to think about it slowly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He could take care of himself later, Calgurio thought as a matter of course. His face was no longer the same self-preserving and desire-driven expression it once was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get down to business. The reason I have gathered you all here today is to get a consensus on how we should move forward. Adalmann-dono has generously given me the freedom to discuss this with you. Let us not waste his kindness and have a meaningful time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio started the discussion, and those present looked at each other and began to discuss. This was an unthinkable situation in a military meeting, but for Calgurio, who wanted everyone&rsquo;s honest opinions, it was a welcome thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The chatting continued for a while. The discussion was narrowed down to roughly two main opinions. Those who insisted that they should remain subservient. And those who insisted that they should return to the Empire once and for all. The two sides were in direct conflict with each other. Both sides had understandable arguments, and it was natural that those who had families would insist on returning to the Empire. However, whether or not they could return to their homeland depended on the intentions of Demon Lord Rimuru. There was a possibility that they would be allowed to do so after further negotiations, but if they made too much noise, they might cause the demon lord&rsquo;s displeasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As Adalmann-dono said, I trust that there is no intention to execute us for nothing. But we must keep in mind that this does not mean that we are pardoned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as they had been saved, their fate was in the hands of the demon lord. Even though they were allowed a certain degree of freedom, it was unknown as to what extent their selfishness would be accepted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;In any case, we will be executed even if we do go back. But still, I would like to let the generals who fought for our country return home safely. I would like to appeal directly to his Majesty Rimuru and ask for his favor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, we are basically hostages. Whether the home country will pay compensation or not, that is the difficult point.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, Major General Minits, who had been silently listening to everyone&rsquo;s opinions, opened his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Impossible. In the first place, we did not even expect to lose. We ourselves had been so ruthless in our attitude toward our adversaries.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone was silenced by his words. The Empire had never accepted anything but unconditional surrender in the first place. It was only because they had been winning that they had been allowed to be so arrogant. Now that they had fought and been utterly defeated, they would be on their own if they were not forgiven. Everyone understood this fact and realized that the future was not bright, even if they did return to the Empire. Even so, they still wanted to fulfill their responsibility to those with families.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Major General Minits is right. I wonder what his Majesty will think about this&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hate to say this, but it was an oversight of the intelligence bureau. Did they even realize how many demon lord class monsters there were out there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the officers made a statement that should not have been spoken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, you! Be careful of what you say. I don&rsquo;t care what you think of the Bureau of Intelligence, but you can be sure that the people you&rsquo;re referring to as monsters are the top brass of this country!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, it was my mistake&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Free speech was welcome, and no one here was a monster. Calgurio had not seen Adalmann since yesterday and thought that he must be meeting somewhere. That is why today&rsquo;s military meeting was held, but that was not a reason to tolerate all the comments. They must not forget that they were prisoners of war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;His Majesty Rimuru may be a generous man, but he will not overlook outbursts against his men. Please remember that and be careful of what you say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio concluded by saying that he agreed with the officer&rsquo;s opinion. At the least, one could understand just how terrifying Demon Lord Rimuru was simply by the fact that he had someone under his command who could handle an extremely powerful magic like &lsquo;Gravity Collapse&rsquo;. Why didn&rsquo;t the intelligence bureau know about such a dangerous opponent?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">I very much understand your desire to scold them for being negligent though. I honestly wanted to say that lie myself&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio thought so inwardly. However, someone then made a comment that felt as if ice cold water was poured on Calgurio and the other officers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you idiots? Listen up, the intelligence bureau already had a certain amount of information at that time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie, who had been listening to the conversation in silence all this time, suddenly burst out laughing and said so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nonsense! Then why did they withhold the correct information from His Majesty?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did they betray us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie&rsquo;s words had everyone in a state of fluster. Only Minits and Calgurio remained calm. Minits was the first to open his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bernie, you say? I believe you were on an undercover mission that we weren&rsquo;t even informed about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next was Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. As a Single Digit, it&rsquo;s no surprise that you had access to top-secret information that even we didn&rsquo;t know. So, what were they thinking, and what did they want us to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment the question was posed, everyone&rsquo;s eyes focused on Bernie. Everyone wanted to know. The Intelligence Bureau was sworn to His Majesty the Emperor with absolute loyalty. It was hard to believe that they would betray the Emperor, which meant that Emperor Rudra was also in a position to know of this situation. Bernie snorted and looked around at Calgurio and the others with pity. Then, without hesitation, he dropped the bombshell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just as you might have imagined. His Majesty the Emperor also knew everything from the start. Your defeat was already in the works.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-How could&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean? Did His Majesty send his army knowing we would lose?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way! You insult His Majesty too much!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The officers were in distress. However, some of them had already begun to understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess that makes sense. So, in other words, we were pawns.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not an accurate way of putting it, Minits. I&rsquo;m afraid that the main purpose was&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph! Shut up, Calgurio. I&rsquo;ll take responsibility for this leak of state secrets. You&rsquo;re all dead men, including me, so this isn&rsquo;t a betrayal of His Majesty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was Bernie&rsquo;s determination. Now that he had lost his power as a &lsquo;Single Digit&rsquo; and had been deprived of the ultimate skill lent to him by the Emperor, he was now the superior figure to show the way for everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bernie&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Jiwu. I, for one, wasn&rsquo;t that loyal to His Majesty. The only reason I followed him was because I could never beat him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was also Bernie&rsquo;s true feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Born forty-five years ago in the United States, Bernie was an ordinary student who loved freedom. Somehow he had come to this world and was discovered by Gadra. He was taken in by Damrada and learned the art of fighting. He became confident and even became proud that he was one of the best in this world. Then Bernie&rsquo;s confidence was shattered by a woman who was a close associate of Emperor Rudra. No, rather, she was a monster despite her beautiful appearance. The supreme being of the world that would never be reached, no matter how the heavens and the earth were turned upside down, no matter how many times one was reincarnated. He could not believe that such a being existed, but it was indeed real.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her name was Velgrynd. She was one of the top secrets of the Empire. One day, Bernie was escorted by Damrada to the Emperor&rsquo;s castle. It was a great honor, and it furthered Bernie&rsquo;s ambition. As a freedom-loving person, Bernie could not tolerate the Emperor&rsquo;s domination over others. Therefore, he had foolishly dreamed of overthrowing the Emperor if possible. The price of such foolishness was extreme fear. It was there that Bernie met Velgrynd for the first time. And after understanding true fear, he naturally gave in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emperor Rudra approached Bernie from behind the blind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;You are qualified. As a vessel, I will lend you my strength, so keep up the good work.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He thought he heard Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s voice, devoid of any emotion, coming from far away. The next time he regained consciousness, he found himself in a body that could not resist the Emperor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;His Majesty, you know, doesn&rsquo;t care if a million of his best men are wiped out. Rather, it is all part of the plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was impossible to make sense of for most people just by hearing it, however, Calgurio understood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;So that&rsquo;s it. So they are willing to sacrifice a million soldiers if the result will be that some of us can be awakened like me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie was a bit surprised that he was able to guess the correct answer with such a simple explanation. However, upon hearing Calgurio say, &lsquo;one who awakened like me&rsquo;, it all made sense to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;ve awakened as well. In that case, you understand, and you&rsquo;re correct. His Majesty the Emperor wanted to collect the pawns who had been awakened. For that purpose, even if it cost a million sacrifices, he believed it would be worth it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">This was a fact that even the senior officers did not know about.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">From the very beginning, Emperor Rudra had no expectations of the military itself. The most important thing was how to gather awakened people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quality over quantity, is it? In that case, why did they fail in defeating Veldora 300 years ago?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits asked Bernie this with a sharp look in his eyes. Bernie replied aloofly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened back then, but if you think about it, it makes sense, doesn&rsquo;t it? I could have killed you all by myself. That&rsquo;s how far apart in ability we are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-I see&hellip; Is that the reason why our defeat was factored in? A strategy based on the assumption that there would be casualties. While I&rsquo;d like to tell His Majesty that it was for a worthy cause, this time it was nothing but a total failure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it is. His Majesty the Emperor would not have expected to be defeated after awakening.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits nodded in agreement. Calgurio, listening to the conversation, had a bitter look on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alas, it is my fault that I wasn&rsquo;t good enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie denied this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s not that you weren&rsquo;t good enough. It&rsquo;s just that the opponent was too strong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right. That was simply not something we could beat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jiwu nodded in agreement. They, too, had been defeated by Diablo, who had defeated Calgurio. It was in no way surprising that Calgurio couldn&rsquo;t win against a monster that they themselves could not defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does this mean that the strength of the forces here is greater than the intelligence bureau expected?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It should be. The plan to use Demon Lord Rimuru as a stepping stone to increase our leverage here was foiled the moment we misjudged the strength of our opponents.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie spoke as if he couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. It was not a situation that could easily be laughed at, since a great deal of sacrifice had gone to waste. However, Bernie still felt in his heart that the Emperor deserved it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;So, Bernie-kun, now that your surprise attack while using us as a diversion seems to have failed, what are you planning to do after this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? I told you. I&rsquo;ll take responsibility.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Minits asked calmly. In the silent tent, everyone waited for Bernie&rsquo;s answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get one thing straight. As I said before, you guys are already dead. I don&rsquo;t mean that in a metaphorical sense, but in His Majesty&rsquo;s sense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. Are you suggesting that his Majesty doesn&rsquo;t want us to be alive?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bit of a misnomer. It means that he has no need for soldiers whose power has been taken from them and whose chances of awakening have been reduced to zero. If you&rsquo;re of no value to him, then it means he has no further reason to protect you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I suppose that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;On that basis, it is very likely that they will not accept the return of prisoners of war. No, not only that. If the surviving soldiers return home, the anti-war sentiment will spread. Do you think that would be in accordance with His Majesty&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits let out a sigh. He understood what Bernie was trying to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words, we are nothing more than a distraction to the intelligence bureau now that we are no longer important to His Majesty, correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Will he move to deal with those who are trying to return home?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Definitely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then they would put the blame on Tempest, inciting anger and vengeance among their subjects. Bernie explained with certainty that the intelligence bureau would work in that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;700,000? That&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Those who have undergone the transformative operation have not lost that much power. If we fought back, we would be fighting amongst ourselves!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits silenced the officers, who began to make a fuss by restraining them with his hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you have any idea who could do that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits remained calm amidst the many who wanted to say that this was absurd. And Calgurio, remembering his own awakening, remained silent. With that power, it was not impossible, he decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it possible with Single Digits?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you can do it, you can do it, however, that is just an empty theory. Superb individual strength was good for offense, but not for defense. If one was outnumbered, there would be areas that couldn&rsquo;t be defended. Similarly, it was not appropriate to chase a fleeing enemy. If they spread out and ran away, they would inevitably be missed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in this case, it was necessary to eliminate them without letting any of them live. Bernie really had no idea who would be able to do that. Except for one person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Common sense tells you that such a thing is not possible, right? But there is someone out there. In the Empire, there is an absolute monster who is able to do it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie remembered that figure and trembled with fear. Their beauty and horror could only be understood by those who have encountered them. Bernie, who understood it, felt a little unfortunate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4">&hellip;</span><span class="c14">Is it really so frightening to you, a Single Digit? It seems I was mistaken.&rdquo; Minits said, slumping deeply into his chair and looking up to the heavens.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me too. I had dreamed of joining the army and ruling the world in the name of the Empire. However&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this was all decided long ago in a place that had nothing to do with the military. From the start, there had been no place for the unawakened in the power game being played by someone else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This was foolish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah. I find myself as ridiculous as a clown.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio and Minits looked at each other with mournful faces. It was not only Calgurio and the others, but all the senior officers in attendance, who looked as if they had just woken up from a dream they were lamenting. Pathetic&mdash;Bernie thought. They would have been happier not knowing the truth, but that would not have satisfied them. That&rsquo;s why Bernie had spoken out of turn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now you understand. Do you see the situation? If you go back, nothing but despair awaits you. So just stay here as prisoners and wait until the war is over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bernie-dono, what are you going to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to the Empire. His Majesty Rimuru will try to sit down to negotiate with the Empire, since the war will not end like this. In that case, they&rsquo;ll need a guide, won&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That guide would probably be wiped out. Bernie, now that he had lost his power, would surely be assassinated. Sensing Bernie&rsquo;s resolve, everyone fell silent. They understood that their destiny was entrusted to the Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c17 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Adalmann was in a deep sleep from yesterday&rsquo;s ritual. The Harvest Festival had begun, but Adalmann&rsquo;s castle was still destroyed. As such, he had been taken to the guest room of the main building on the ground floor and put to sleep. Albert and Wenti were also put in an empty room, so they would wake up soon. The problem was the prisoners of the Imperial Army. Adalmann had been in charge of them, and it would be bad to leave them unattended. Besides, I thought I would ask them for information about the Empire, now that things had calmed down. Since it was a good opportunity, I decided to go and check on them. I was accompanied by my two secretaries. With these two, I could rest assured that nothing would happen to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama shouldn&rsquo;t have to go on his own&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, will you go for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, you go and talk to them!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu, then we might as well go together!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo was as consistent as ever. Was that true of Shion as well? She was never one to leave voluntarily. Well, there was no way I would ever let Shion go alone. I was thinking about this as I was clutched in Shion&rsquo;s arms. By the way, these two were still in good spirits, despite the evolutionary ritual they had gone through yesterday. Shion had not changed at all after one night. And Diablo was back to his perfectly normal self.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, did you gain a new Skill?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu! Thanks to Rimuru-sama, I have succeeded in acquiring an Ultimate Skill! Finally, I don&rsquo;t have to put up with Guy&rsquo;s annoying boasting!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Guy&rsquo;s point of view, Diablo must be the annoying one. For some reason, I was absolutely sure of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you were so annoyed, why didn&rsquo;t you get one by yourself? I think Diablo would have been able to gain an Ultimate Skill without my help, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, that is not how it works. If Guy told me to get it, it would look like I was copying him, which would be awkward.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t get it. This is not about imitation. As long as it&rsquo;s useful, I think it should be fine, but was I wrong?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, Diablo is narrow-minded. Didn&rsquo;t the saying go&mdash;&rsquo;hearing is a temporary shame, not hearing is a lifetime shame&rsquo;? Since Rimuru-sama taught me that, I always listen to what others have to say. Gobichi-dono also taught me the essence of cooking, and now I am fully licensed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion spoke to him with a smug look on her face. But I think&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think that was just because Gobichi ran away from him. Please don&rsquo;t give Shion a false sense of confidence. I hope you will take responsibility for Shion and take care of her until the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that the reason? The last time, Gobichi-dono was hospitalized. It is only natural for him to get sick if he has to deal with Shion&rsquo;s cooking all the time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">O-oh, I see&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t blame Gobichi-kun for that. In this case, Diablo had already undergone a painful experience before, and Shuna would never try to taste it. I knew it had to be Benimaru, after all. That&rsquo;s right, it was Benimaru&rsquo;s responsibility to educate Shion, and I would remind him of it thoroughly. This was not harassment towards a newlywed. I hope you will not misunderstand me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While we were having such a conversation, we finally arrived at our destination. After I transferred to the hillside of the 70th floor, everyone who saw me immediately stood up and saluted me. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right way to treat a demon lord of an enemy country, however Diablo and Shion seemed to be satisfied, so I didn&rsquo;t linger on it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;His Majesty Rimuru is here! Contact Sir Calgurio immediately!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then everyone began to move with a flurry of activity, and a path was formed as the soldiers lined up towards a single tent. It seemed that Calgurio and his men were currently holding a military meeting in that tent. We were explained this and were led to the tent. Inside the tent, there were about a hundred soldiers. They all stood erect and saluted me, welcoming me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was a little surprised to see such a reaction even here. I was, after all, a king of an enemy country, and I am also a slime. I guess Wisdom King Raphael-san&rsquo;s plan was more successful than I had expected, since I was not looked down upon even though I was a slime. Well, it&rsquo;s not surprising if you think about it. Perhaps it is wiser to obey the one who can kill you and bring you back to life. I&rsquo;m confident that I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go against such a dangerous person either. I agreed that this was the case, and took a seat at the head of the table where I was led.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, in order to look dignified in this place, I took upon a human form. Behind me were Shion and Diablo. Shion looked a little disappointed after I jumped out of her arms. I looked around at everyone and then spoke up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, guys. It&rsquo;s good to see all the top brass here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;Y-Yes!&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They all bowed their heads at once, but this made it even more difficult for me to talk to them. I asked them all to be seated and then got down to business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All of you relax. I&rsquo;m here to talk to you guys today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I said as such and smiled at them. I hoped that this would ease their minds, and that we would be able to have a meeting with a friendly atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Adalmann has some business to attend to and may not be able to come for a while. So, I was wondering if you had any requests.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are too kind to say so. We have been well taken care of, so please do not worry about the likes of us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So stiff! Calgurio answered on behalf of everyone, completely submissive to us. No, rather, I guess this was a normal attitude. They had lost the war, so this was the right thing to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good. So then, about our future plans&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes! On that point, we have a request for you as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A request? I hoped it would be reasonable, but I asked him just for the sake of asking. Then Calgurio made a surprising offer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We would like to ask for your kindness and cooperation to see if your country can accommodate us for the time being&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the&hellip;? I listened to the details. According to Calgurio&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had just now been discussing their future plans. The conclusion they came to was that even if they returned to the Empire, there was a high probability that all of them would be killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, no, you, don&rsquo;t be absurd! What kind of country kills its soldiers who fought for their country just because they lost!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was so surprised that I couldn&rsquo;t even think about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, I think for sure that would be the case.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Look who it is&mdash;Bernie. He explained the situation to me in a calm and orderly manner, as if he was not the same person who had previously targeted us. From what he explained, it was difficult to say that such a thing wouldn&rsquo;t happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip;sacrificing a million people to awaken just one person? You must be kidding&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, wait, wait. If that&rsquo;s true, it sounds unusual that the military invasion was postponed for fear of Veldora&rsquo;s unsealing. Perhaps they were mistaken, and they were actually waiting for Veldora to come back to life?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I do not understand what Emperor Rudra was thinking. However, I am of the opinion that His Majesty Rimuru&rsquo;s opinion is correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is this guy really Bernie? He&rsquo;s being polite at a level that makes me wonder if he is a different person. I mean, is he? Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s true goal was not simply to win the war. He wanted to select the strong men who would be awakened by pitting the Empire&rsquo;s soldiers against a powerful enemy. It was too large of a move, and too far out of the ordinary.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. A very interesting idea.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You idiot! Using people as experimental materials is not funny at all. Come to think of it, Wisdom King Raphael-san has a side like that, too. Zegion was a correct example of success, but I&rsquo;m honestly scared that I might be experimented on without my knowledge.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;No. No such fact has been confirmed.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Really? Well, I&rsquo;ll believe that part. Anyway, let&rsquo;s put that on the back burner for now. The question was whether or not to accept Calgurio&rsquo;s request.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, ah, your meals won&rsquo;t be free either. We&rsquo;ll have to get food for 700,000 people from other countries&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hesitated to throw them out when I heard they were going to be killed. However, I really felt that there was no reason to protect them in my country. I was responsible only for my own people. As much as I&rsquo;d like to say that I wanted them to live well, I couldn&rsquo;t just ignore this, could I? With the influx of 700,000 professional soldiers, the Kingdom of Blumund and other western countries would not remain silent. Even if we don&rsquo;t do anything wrong, there would be unnecessary bloodshed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That being said, it would be cruel to ask them to return to the Empire. Once you save a life, you should be responsible for it until the end. I had no choice but to take care of them. However, it was impossible to ask me to do so without some sort of compensation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In our country, we practice the saying, &lsquo;he who does not work does not eat&rsquo;. I will ask you all to earn your own rations, is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio and the others, who had been watching my response with bated breath, showed bright expressions upon hearing my words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At your service!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They seemed very motivated, even though they had not yet been told what they were going to be doing. That being the case, I will allow them to stay. In the first place, I had thought that it would be meaningless to take prisoners of war against the Empire. There was no wartime agreement, so there was no agreement at all. And from what Bernie told me, it turned out that they would not be a bargaining chip for the ceasefire. If that was the case, it was better to accept them as a labor force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The length of their stay was undecided, but at least until the war with the Empire was over, they would work for us. If the period of stay is short, they may be useless, so we would have to wait and see. I could only hope that they would be of some use. Well, Calgurio and the others didn&rsquo;t seem to be willing to go against my words, so I&rsquo;d leave them with Geld and let him make use of them. However, Geld was currently in an evolutionary slumber. He wouldn&rsquo;t wake up for a while, so I&rsquo;d have to see what they could do before then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, are any of you good at civil engineering?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The military, surprisingly, had a lot of people who were good with technology. In my previous life, there was a well-known story of a samurai commanding the construction of a castle. Even in modern times, it was reported in the news that the Self-Defense Forces played a great role in overseas relief efforts. Similarly, the Dwargon craftsmen were proud of their advanced technology in this world as well. They were quite fairly normal, but made a huge difference. And it was no exaggeration to say that the foundation of our country was built because of Kaijin, the former commander of such a dwarfish craft unit. In such a way, the link between the military and civil engineering technology were inseparable&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course! We are proud to say that our technology is the best in the Empire!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good. In that case, I&rsquo;ll see your skills firsthand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, first order of business. The destroyed castle you see before you, I want you to restore it beautifully. I&rsquo;ll get the materials, but I want you to start from the design phase. Can you do it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since they destroyed it, I want them to fix it with their own hands. Calgurio nodded at my request.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio nodded confidently, and the men who appeared to be his subordinates began to move in response. The promptness and control of the men were exactly what one would expect from those who were capable of doing their jobs. When Adalmann woke up, the skeletons would also be ready to help, so it seemed that the restoration would be finished in the not-too-distant future. And just like that, I decided to appoint the Imperial Army to the job.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Since I needed to make detailed inquiries, I selected some of Calgurio&rsquo;s subordinates who were familiar with the situation and asked them to accompany me to the meeting room. I was planning to hold a meeting to discuss countermeasures with the executives who were still awake. At this point, the Imperialists must not be aware of the defeat of Calgurio&rsquo;s group. Yuuki would have received reports from Misha and Laplace, but it was too much to worry about information leakage from them. And we, for our part, were aware of the Empire&rsquo;s moves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had also informed Luminas of the movement of about 300 airships over the sea route.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Hmph! Let&rsquo;s just see how they&rsquo;ll fight back!&rsaquo; She spoke boldly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t think Luminas would move on her own, but she still had an agreement with me. Luminas was supposed to prevent the Imperial Army from coming from the north. The Holy Empire of Lubelius was the headquarters of their religion and had produced many Holy Knights. They also had the hidden force of &lsquo;vampires&rsquo; and we could trust them with our lives. In case Luminas was ever in danger, 150,000 Western Reserve Forces would come to her aid. Testarossa&rsquo;s men were standing by to respond immediately. Above all, since Hinata was working with Luminas, we were definitely well-prepared for a crisis. However, we still could not be too careful. I looked around the gathered people and announced the start of the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The following seventeen members gathered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Secretaries Shion and Diablo. Grand Admiral Benimaru. Those in charge of administration&mdash;Rigurd and Kaijin. Corp Commanders Gabil and Gobta. Advisor Hakurou. Intelligence officer Souei. Gadra as a key witness. I also called the three demon girls Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera. From the Imperial side, there was Calgurio himself, Minits, and the duo of Bernie and Jiwu. Including me, there were eighteen of us here.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We started with self-introductions, and when the imperial side learned that Diablo and the three demon girls were &lsquo;primordials&rsquo;, they were absolutely mortified. Their stares were very painful. I&rsquo;m sorry. It was all Diablo&rsquo;s fault, not mine. Sensing the possibility of another complaint, I decided to proceed as if nothing had happened. Let&rsquo;s just get on with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, just say as much as you can tell me, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After saying that, I projected an image of the flying boat squadron with my physical magic : Argus. I ask Calgurio to explain the current situation of the Empire, as I had asked him to do beforehand. The Imperial side faltered when they saw the images on the large surveillance screen. Calgurio remained calm and immediately started to explain the situation. I knew some of the details from Gadra. The old man did not care about the betrayal, but Calgurio was a soldier. He may not be able to tell me some things, so I needed to follow up with Gadra. He told me what he knew and I asked him to explain on that basis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. Then, let me explain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio was more articulate than I had expected. Calgurio&rsquo;s Armored Corps had a division called the &lsquo;Air Assault Division&rsquo;, which had a modern air force of 400 ships, called airships. Three hundred of them were currently transporting other corps to the northern part of the Kingdom of Ingracia. Each airship could carry a maximum of 400 passengers. They said that 50 people were enough to pilot the ships, and that each ship could carry 350 people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was exactly what Gadra had told me. The force being transported was the &lsquo;Magic Beast Corps&rsquo; of 30,000 men, led by the imperial general named Gladium. However, it seems that they were combined with magic beasts, which could be called their partners. In that aspect, they were actually carrying 60,000 combatants. The rest, it seems, were support personnel who provided logistical support. The command of them was entrusted to a Major General named Zamud, but since he seemed to be a non-combatant, he would not be counted as a force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am ashamed to talk about this here, but most of the men who went to Ingracia were apprentices. They can operate airships, but in actual combat, their accuracy will be quite poor. They should only be engaged in research, so please give them mercy somehow&hellip;&rdquo; Calgurio said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, the full force was put up against our country, so only non-combatants of their rival, General Gladium could be lent. There were about 30,000 such support personnel, but none of them were wizard class, and most of them were sorcerer class. The rest were technicians to maintain the airships. They asked us to take them as prisoners of war without killing them if possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You bastard, there&rsquo;s a limit to what you can do! You invaded our country, and now you want us to help without killing you just because you are about to lose?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion screamed in rage and Calgurio turned pale and apologized. I tried to calm Shion down, but I also thought Shion had a point. Calgurio seemed to understand that well enough and apologized for his mistake&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not up to us to deal with that. Depending on the situation, we may have to ask them to give up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, we are aware of that. It will be as Your Majesty Rimuru wills it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d consider it if I could, but there were no promises. Even my resurrection magic was not universal, and in some situations it was impossible. Besides, depending on Luminas&rsquo; reaction, I may not be able to do anything. I heard that the threat of the &lsquo;Magic Beast Corps&rsquo; led by Gladium was also considerable, and there was no guarantee that Hinata and the others would not be significantly damaged. If that happened, there would be no time to show mercy. I believed that we would not be defeated since our defense capability was also quite strong, but since there were no absolutes in war, I could not make such a promise so lightly. And that was the end of the story. Next, I wanted to talk about the Eastern city of Dwargon.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

The image displayed an army of 60,000 men. They were not looking tense, but were all comfortably encamped. I explained the situation to the Imperials, who were again looking at me with shock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Currently, an alliance has been formed between Yuuki and me, albeit reluctantly. The fact that we are staring at each other here is just a performance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as I said this, Minits laughed at himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is a mess. If a part of the army had been taken from the beginning, there was no chance for us to win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. The moment our &lsquo;Armored Corps&rsquo; and Gladium&rsquo;s &lsquo;Magic Beast Corps&rsquo; were gone, they would turn their fangs on the Imperial City. Then it would be checkmate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two men&rsquo;s faces were pained as they realized that they had been defeated not only in terms of strength, but also in terms of strategy. However, there were some who disagreed with their statement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. There are still those who protect the Emperor in the capital. I repeat again and again, those who have awakened are equal to an army. I am sure he knew the possibility of Yuuki&rsquo;s rebellion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie&rsquo;s statement, however, seemed to me to be a different person from Masayuki&rsquo;s old follower because of his strong image.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you the real Bernie?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, no. I am actually more like the person I was when I was working with Masayuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question came out of my mouth, and Bernie answered it with a lawful answer. He said that his current attitude was that of a military man, and that he was naturally more open-minded. He also told me that he used to be an American. By the way, he was forty-five years old. He used to be an ordinary student, and the current Bernie was the result of his education after he came here. It was not important information for anyone but him, but I felt a little closer to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, now that you put it that way. I&rsquo;ve heard that there is someone in the Empire who could kill me, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if a normally deadlocked situation could be easily overturned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When you think about it, quality over quantity is the real problem in this world. No matter how much power one gathers, if you can&rsquo;t beat just one person, you will be defeated. Because we had won the war, I would have to consider the opposite situation as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, I&rsquo;ll go over there and give them a good beating!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion spoke boldly with the large sword in her hand. Since there was no guarantee that she could win the fight, of course I rejected it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, then I will do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rejected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t imagine a situation where Diablo lost, but I was still going to vote no. My policy was to wait and see until I can create a situation where we can definitely win. I reminded everyone once again to be thorough about this. In any case, the important thing was gathering information. The number of failures due to lack of information was too many to count. I had to make sure that I would not make the same mistake this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So then, you were sticking to Masayuki in order to get close to me without being suspected, right? To tell the truth, I didn&rsquo;t notice it at all, and the timing of the attack was dangerous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I turned to Bernie and Jiwu. It may have been Damrada&rsquo;s order, but it was a perfect operation that even Wisdom King Raphael-san did not notice. I had to commend him for his skills, even though he was my enemy. I think it was not easy for one to keep their best power hidden until the very moment when they have the chance to kill. This time I had gotten the upper hand, but if anything had been wrong, the situation could have been reversed. If that had happened, things would have been exactly what the Emperor wanted. Without me and Benimaru, Tempest&rsquo;s army would have been overrun by the Empire in confusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was too confident and careless. I was under the impression that the labyrinth was safe. Now I will always remember to be aware of danger at any time during war.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me too. I will make sure that anyone who approaches Rimuru-sama is subjected to a more thorough background check.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although Benimaru and Souei had been concerned about this for a long time now, it was not their fault alone. They were more alert than I was, expecting every possible eventuality. My lack of sense of crisis was also something I needed to reflect on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damrada-sama ordered me to protect Masayuki. I was not told the reason, so I thought that it was to prevent leakage of information.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am the same way. We did not receive the order at the same time, but we were trying to keep our identities secret from each other through different channels. It was only when the assassination order for His Majesty Rimuru was issued that I remembered that Bernie was also a &lsquo;Single Digit&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie and Jiwu joined our conversation. Since I recognized their right to remain silent, I appreciated their willingness to talk. However, I had some concerns about what they said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You just &lsquo;remembered&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I have never met a &lsquo;Single Digit&rsquo; other than myself, so it was only after the order was issued that I learned that Jiwu was one as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am the same way. Perhaps, except for the Commander and the Deputy Commander, nobody knows each other&rsquo;s identities.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was surprised to hear that answer. I was also surprised to hear that the best forces in the Empire did not know each other&rsquo;s identities. Why would they do that?</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. The presumed purpose is to prevent betrayal.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Hmmm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they don&rsquo;t know each other&rsquo;s identity, they can&rsquo;t cooperate with each other and try to overthrow each other. It&rsquo;s not very thorough, but I guess that&rsquo;s how careful they are to protect the Emperor&rsquo;s safety, huh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s understandable, but it also seems wasteful and inefficient. If they are comrades, they should have cooperated with each other from the beginning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I said so, Gadra chuckled as he expressed his opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, may I have permission to speak less respectfully?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. You&rsquo;re more than welcome to do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, Gadra said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s idea is excellent, but it is not very prudent. I know Damrada well, and he is a cunning man. He does not trust his own people, and is very cautious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that Wisdom King Raphael-san was correct in its reading that this was to prevent betrayal. I remembered that he was one of the heads of the secret society Cerberus and that he only trusted in &lsquo;Gold&rsquo;. And he was a top member of the &lsquo;Single Digits&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never met him, but he seems like a dangerous guy. I was sure he was Single Digit, judging from the way he tried to assassinate Gadra. Besides, if he is in a position to give orders to Bernie and Jiwu, is Damrada the leader of the group?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I asked this question, Gadra denied it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, Damrada must be the deputy. I think the leader is definitely Tatsuya Kondou.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I recalled, he was the director of the Imperial Intelligence Bureau, and one of the people Gadra was on the lookout for. Gadra himself said he did not know much about him. So we did not have much information about him, but I supposed that Gadra was convinced by the revelation of Damrada&rsquo;s true identity. The entire Imperial side was in a mood of resignation, wondering just how much they knew about him. Bernie and Jiwu gave us some useful information, as if they thought there was no point in hiding it now. Gadra was right, Damrada was the vice-commander of the Imperial Guardians and ranked second in the hierarchy. I did not know if Kondou was the leader or not, but I was sure that Damrada was a big shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Good job, Gadra</span><span class="c14">, I thought as I listened to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, this attack on His Majesty Rimuru was not an order from Damrada-sama, but a secret order from the Commander.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Same for me. I had a feeling that it was strange because the order to escort Masayuki was overridden.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jiwu told me that he even prepared a story about the rescue of one village so that Masayuki would trust her. Jiwu says that she finally became one of the guards after Masayuki saved her life and she was given a position of repayment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If they were going to reveal themselves at the same time, it would have been better if they had worked together from the beginning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree with you. I always thought that I was using Masayuki to avoid your suspicion because it was the best opportunity for him&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking back now there are a few doubts&mdash;Bernie concluded with some questions. Assuming that their stories were true, it is possible that Damrada and the leader of the group had different intentions. It was hard to believe that Damrada would give an order to completely abandon the entire arrangement when he himself had set it all up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, it actually might be a sacrifice to increase the success rate, but I also thought that there could have been a different way to do it. It was natural that Bernie and his colleagues had doubts, and it was natural to think that there was some underlying reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, have any of you in the Empire ever had an audience with Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s face?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was curious, so I asked such a question. Only one person, Gadra, raised his hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding, right? You don&rsquo;t even know the faces of the people you serve?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru seemed surprised and muttered in a low voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem like a ruler at all. He is so friendly that he eats from the shops in town and converses with anyone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, hey, hey.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no disrespect. King Gazel has his side too, though he&rsquo;s stricter than your side. However, most princes and aristocrats are a little bit more formal. I&rsquo;m sure there are some who won&rsquo;t show their faces to the lower ranks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I guess&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree with Kaijin-dono&rsquo;s opinion, but there are some points that I don&rsquo;t understand. Hiding your face from those who are supposed to protect you is a bit too much, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yeah. I feel it&rsquo;s not possible for me to be a part of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rigurd expressed his opinion to Kaijin, to which he readily agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s strange, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much strange as it is an anomaly. Bernie, if you don&rsquo;t mind my asking&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou asked Bernie while answering Gobta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How is it that you, the guardians of the Emperor, do not know the face of your lord? How can you protect your lord?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under his sharp eyes, Bernie opens his mouth with renewed spirit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple. Only those in the first six ranks can see His Majesty&rsquo;s face. The Commander and the Vice Commander are often away, and the other four attend His Majesty at all times.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were called the Four Knights, and as far as Bernie and Jiwu knew, they were so fierce that they had not been replaced for many years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words, you are not trusted to that extent. Are you inferior to these Four Knights in terms of ability?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou asked the hard questions. Bernie answered a little regretfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You may take it that way. It is true that it is difficult for me to win against those four. Not only that, His Majesty, has &lsquo;that person&rsquo; by his side. The fearful Lord Marshal, whom I can never defeat. I don&rsquo;t think we can beat them even if all the Single Digits attack at once.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Here we go again, another powerful person. At the moment, there is Kondou, Damrada, the Four Knights, and now the &lsquo;Marshal&rsquo;. Assuming that there are nine &lsquo;Single Digits&rsquo;, there are only seven left, excluding Bernie and Jiwu. The numbers match perfectly</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">or not. If we separated them by the sixth rank, then it was natural to consider the &lsquo;Marshal&rsquo; as a separate entry. In that case, we should consider that there is another &lsquo;Single Digit&rsquo; who is working separately. In other words, those are the eight members that we should watch out for. If Kondou was a different person from the leader, then we would have one more person to watch out for. This was a very troublesome story. It was good to know about it, but now I wanted to make sure of something else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, I heard from Gadra that Masayuki and Emperor Rudra have the same face.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra nodded at my words. Seeing this, everyone remained silent in thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damrada&rsquo;s order was to protect Masayuki, right? He kept everyone in the dark, making sure that no one would suspect him of anything. And then, the order was given without any regard to the setup. I&rsquo;m guessing Damrada and the leader had different purposes, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought I was sure by now, so I presented my idea. Presumably, I think Damrada really wanted to protect Masayuki. I don&rsquo;t know why, but I am sure it has something to do with the fact that he is a duplicate of Emperor Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You said you were using Masayuki, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. It was unclear why I needed to protect him. That&rsquo;s why I agreed to the Commander&rsquo;s order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Same for me. Damrada-sama did not give me any reason.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was using Masayuki to get close to me. If Damrada had given orders to Bernie and his group, I would have agreed with that idea. However, the fact that the Commander and others intervened raised a question that I had to confirm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you think that the leader of the group knows about Masayuki&rsquo;s face?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmmm, that&rsquo;s a difficult question. If Kondou is the leader of the group, as I believe, he must have known about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know the details, but we do know about Kondou. He is an unpredictable man, and it is rumored that he has all the information in the Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;The monster who eats information&rsquo; is the nickname given to Lieutenant Kondou, the head of the Intelligence Bureau. We in the military and the Intelligence Bureau have always had a bitter relationship with him. We have tried several times to initiate hostilities, but each time we failed. This is proof that he is not a simpleton.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio was trying to keep his story under wraps, but Minits had no intention of hiding it. He even revealed the backstory and explained that Kondou was a dangerous man. If a man as good as Minits was like this, then Kondou was probably really powerful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At the least, he is not an opponent I could beat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The old man Gadra was a very strong man. In my opinion, he was as strong as a Saint, if not stronger. Although his magicule count was low, his magic skill-level was outstandingly high. Since such Gadra declared that he could not win, Kondou had to be a Saint for sure. In other words, he was as strong as Hinata and King Gazel. By the way, Bernie and Jiwu were also saints, and Calgurio was also awakened. I didn&rsquo;t think Gadra, who could not use Ultimate Skill, could have won against them. In any case, we know that Kondou is strong. If he was so well-informed to the point that he is called &lsquo;the monster that eats information&rsquo;, we should assume that he knew of Masayuki as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Kondou knew about Masayuki, he must have had a different agenda from Damrada&rsquo;s. Bernie and his group attacked Masayuki with such vigor that they did not care if Masayuki died. This contradicts Damrada&rsquo;s order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I said as such, Bernie said something difficult to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Actually, the Commander had ordered us to &lsquo;get rid of Masayuki because he is no longer needed&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie and Jiwu seemed to have grown attached to Masayuki while traveling with him, and hesitated to kill him. So they were planning to consider how to dispose of Masayuki after killing me. It would be all right if they could hide him somewhere. If not, they were going to use magic to take away his memory. In any case, this confirmed it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That means there is something in Masayuki. I feel sorry for him, but we&rsquo;ll have to escort him for the time being. Souei, can I count on you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yup. Souei is still as reliable as ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damrada and the leader have different agendas. One wants to protect Masayuki and the other wants to eliminate him. The reasons for this are not clear, but it seems certain that they are at odds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. It would be a good thing if there was an opportunity to take advantage of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be that optimistic, however, it is good news that our enemies are not single-minded.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good news, huh? If it was difficult to distinguish friend from foe, we had no choice but to regard both as enemies. Well, I&rsquo;d just have to hear more to find out.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

That being said, I wanted to keep in mind the movements of those who were not in the military but in the upper ranks, those who could handle Ultimate Skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, tell me about the &lsquo;Single Digits&rsquo;.&rdquo; I asked, and Bernie nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. There are only nine of us &lsquo;Single Digits&rsquo; at any given time. It is possible that someone you know is being kicked out of the competition so that a stronger person can take his/her place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, there isn&rsquo;t much of a difference in strength in the end?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So it would not be surprising if the ninth and tenth places were swapped?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie shook his head in denial.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The eleventh in the pecking order is an assistant for &lsquo;Single Digit&rsquo;. And the tenth rank is called &lsquo;Spare Personnel&rsquo;. But it is only temporary. They are responsible for taking the place of the &lsquo;Single Digit&rsquo; members when there is a dropout from the &lsquo;Single Digits&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is said that there is a big gap between the ninth and the tenth place that cannot be crossed. It seems that it is probably the existence of Ultimate Skill. In other words, it was only when a person had awakened and obtained an Ultimate Skill, that he was recognized as a &lsquo;Single Digit&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, Bernie was ranked 7th and Jiwu was ranked 9th. The correct number to watch out for is at least eight, including the first through the sixth ranks, the eighth rank, and &lsquo;Marshal&rsquo;. Bernie and his colleagues did not seem to know about the Damrada faction. Since they did not even know who the &lsquo;Single Digit&rsquo; beside themselves was, it seemed that their words were not a lie. I wanted to know more information about the other members, so I hoped that we would find something useful to talk about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The spare, the tenth rank, is always on call in the home country. If something happens, he is ready to move. And Imperial Knights below 11th rank always work in pairs and are engaged in solving big cases.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Bernie&rsquo;s description, the tenth rank seemed to be strong as well. They might even be as strong as an awakened demon lord, just that they had not acquired an Ultimate Skill. The remaining ninety Imperial Knights up to the 20th rank and below the 30th rank also seemed to have a higher difference in strength. Even so, even the lowest level of the Imperial Guardians were of the sage class. Some of the top rankers were even said to be close to the Saint class. If the total power of the Eastern Empire was raised, they would probably be strong enough to wage war against several demon lords at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you talking about? The one who defeated us without suffering a single casualty&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a push from Minits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, but the fact that a hundred Imperial Guardians are more of a threat than an army of a million is also a problem to consider.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped. The Imperial Army is only a visible form of military might. A visible instrument of violence was necessary for the fools who did not understand real strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie let out a sigh. This was not only a statement towards the Western countries, but also to his own country, or rather, to the subjects of the Empire, I suppose. The subjects paid taxes in order to guarantee their safety, but to be told that the army protecting them amounted to only a hundred men would make them feel uneasy. It made sense to have a large numbered army, even if it was wasteful. Besides, it was all good when attacking, but more numbers were necessary when defending. The more people you have, the more you need to defend them. In this sense, the policy of the Empire was reasonable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In the past, defense was the main purpose of the army&rsquo;s existence, relying on the elite to invade other countries and to take away their will to rebel. Then, the army would be dispatched to rule in the name of the Emperor. However, they later started to send the armies first. I have always wondered why, but I never realized that the purpose was to create more awakened people&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was also surprised at this, so it seemed that this had been a very important secret. In this way, one could understand Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s purpose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This expedition itself was probably not about achieving victory. In fact, Calgurio-dono was actually awakened, and there were a few others who were likely to be awakened. I think that Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s real purpose in this battle was to increase the number of his pawns.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Benimaru also expressed his opinion, as if he had come to the same conclusion as me.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">Bernie nodded his head and slipped out a few words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There were several subjects on this expedition who were likely to be awakened. Not only General Calgurio, but also Major General Minits, Colonel Kansas, and Krishna. According to the order I received, we were to cooperate with the awakened people to escape. This was the first time I had ever seen the Commander&rsquo;s plan deviate so drastically.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie was smiling at that, but was not amusing to me. If that many people had been awakened, this would have been more than a difficult fight. Besides, now that we knew that the Empire&rsquo;s purpose was to create awakened people, it meant that we had been completely wrong in our judgment. I thought that the Empire had decided to go into this war because they were sure that they could win the war against Western Nations including us. Wisdom King Raphael-san&rsquo;s prediction was the same as mine, and I thought I had not been wrong in my thinking&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;&hellip;Notice. Definitive conclusion has failed due to insufficient intelligence. To ensure completeness, a new conclusion will be redefined.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wisdom King Raphael-san seemed to be a little bit embarrassed. Well, it was too much to ask it to decipher things to that extent, and I didn&rsquo;t intend to make outrageous requests either. Don&rsquo;t feel sorry about this, and just learn from the experience to improve next time.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Understood. Information will be reassessed in order to avoid any omissions.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m really counting on you. As for the future of the Empire, I would refer to Wisdom King Raphael-san&rsquo;s predictions. For now, I would summarize our opinions on what had been learned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rudra is gathering powerful awakened beings. I hate to admit it, but I think he is able to give people Ultimate Skills like he did to Bernie and Jiwu. With the &lsquo;Octagram&rsquo; including myself and other famous champions of Western Nations, I think he is trying to gather enough people in order to defeat us all at the same time and take over the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I said that, Benimaru and Diablo agreed with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tricky, but I agree. That&rsquo;s exactly why they don&rsquo;t care about anyone except for the awakened ones, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, indeed. It is true that human beings are weak, but with an Ultimate Skill, they will be able to compete with us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s funny either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right. If anything is useful, we can just learn it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But that would make the battle less interesting, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, that is an old-fashioned way of thinking, Testarossa. If you are dealing with the have-nots, just don&rsquo;t use the ability either. I think so, and I have already acquired an Ultimate Skill!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that cheating?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just leave it out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The feelings of jealousy of the have-nots is truly delicious! I used to ignore Guy because I didn&rsquo;t want him to feel that way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo was really selfish. Just when I thought he was agreeing with me, the conversation took a funny turn. It was about time for me to stop Diablo&rsquo;s rampage because I was starting to feel a pretty disturbing aura from Testarossa and the girls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Back to the main topic, in Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s opinion, the purpose of the Empire is to select the strong, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I also agree with him. There are people who boast of their strength beyond human beings, such as King Gazel, Lady Hinata, and Her Majesty Elmesia. The balance of power in the world has been kept by the protection of such high ranking people. I can understand that it is only after we gather enough numbers to break the balance that the real work begins.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rigurd and Kaijin had read my thoughts very well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see&hellip;to use the strong to deal with the strong, and surround ourselves with those who are able to help us. The weak are nothing but a hindrance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It sounds like a terrible story, but it will be easier for the weak.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, it would be nice for the weak if wars could be settled only by the strong. However, it goes against my aesthetics to make sacrifices to create the strong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio and Minits also had bitter expressions on their faces when they heard Gabil and the others&rsquo; reactions. As for the people concerned, it must have been a very outrageous way of thinking. And I thought Hakurou&rsquo;s opinion was important, too. In war, those who wanted to fight should fight hard themselves. Involving those who were weak was outrageous. But in reality, the world was a difficult place to live in because there were also situations where one could not say so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, Yuuki boy told me that Demon Lord Guy also seemed unhappy about the increase in the Imperial battle power. I had wondered why Guy, who is said to be the most powerful man in the world, was so vigilant&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra spoke, as if suddenly remembering. It is true that if one has an Ultimate Skill, there is a possibility that the attack will reach Guy. It was natural to be cautious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Guy&rsquo;s goal is the unification of the world by demon lord forces. The Empire that is trying to oppose Guy&rsquo;s goal is a conflict of interest. However&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny. Why does that arrogant Guy tolerate the existence of the Empire?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The battle would be more interesting if the strong gathered together, but Guy is surprisingly serious. I have a feeling that if he could, he would just go there personally and eliminate the fools&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo, Ultima, and Carrera voiced their doubts. Testarossa answered them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple. Velgrynd-sama is there. If we touch the Empire, we will be provoking Velgrynd-sama. That is why I&rsquo;ve been so quiet in the Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Calgurio, who had been listening, looked surprised, while Minits muttered </span><span class="c4">&lsquo;so quiet?&rsquo;</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;in a small voice. I don&rsquo;t know what Testarossa has been doing in the Empire, but it has nothing to do with me. I don&rsquo;t want to be blamed for something that happened a long time ago, so I just let that part slide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What I was interested in was the name &lsquo;Velgrynd&rsquo;. The name &lsquo;Velgrynd&rsquo;, could it be&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a surprise. I didn&rsquo;t know that White Primordial Blanc&mdash;No, Testarossa-dono had so much respect for the &lsquo;Scorch Dragon&rsquo; who lives in the &lsquo;burning mountain of the gods&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Testarossa smiled as if to say, </span><span class="c4">&lsquo;What was that?&rsquo;</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;and Minits hastened to change his words. This convinced me of Velgrynd&rsquo;s true identity. She is one of only four True Dragons in this world, and the sister of Veldora. The ruler of the &lsquo;scorch&rsquo; and the hidden gem of the Empire&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Respect&rsquo; is not the word I would use. My relationship with the True Dragons was somewhat complicated. However, since our lord Rimuru-sama and Veldora-sama are allies, it is only natural that I should pay my respects to Veldora-sama&rsquo;s sister as well, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, if it weren&rsquo;t for the relationship between me and Veldora, Testarossa would never have paid any respects to the &lsquo;True Dragons&rsquo;, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does that mean that Testarossa was quiet because she couldn&rsquo;t win against Velgrynd? Even so, can&rsquo;t you beat Guy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you have to decide whether you can win or not, you cannot win. Not mentioning Guy, it is impossible for me to win. It is not a question of strength or weakness, but the fact that the &lsquo;True Dragons&rsquo; are an incomprehensible and indestructible existence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just what is the &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo; race for Testarossa, the incarnation of &lsquo;incomprehensible&rsquo;, to speak of them as being that way&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could picture Veldora proudly laughing out loud, so I hoped she would never say this in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, the &lsquo;True Dragons&rsquo; are not even a threat to Guy, but it is impossible to destroy them, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not sure. At least with magic, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no victory as long as you cannot kill them completely&mdash;that seems to be common sense among demons. If so, it was certainly impossible to win against a True Dragon. As I recalled, Veldora had also said that. He had mentioned that a &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo; can come back to life even after death. In the case of demons, you can destroy them by destroying their core, but in the case of &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo;, they would still come back to life. In that case, it seems that a part of memories and personalities are reset&hellip;but it may be possible for &lsquo;True Dragons&rsquo; to be resurrected with their memories intact, like some demons. If so, they would literally be &lsquo;indestructible&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, if there was such an opponent in the Empire, we couldn&rsquo;t attack them carelessly, could we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy may be a threat to some, but he was no threat to us. Calgurio and the others looked at each other in confusion. Then, starting with Calgurio, Minits, Jiwu, and Bernie spoke up in that order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;With all due respect, I must say something. As far as I know, it is a fact that the Empire worships Velgrynd-sama as a guardian dragon. Even in the history of the Empire, she has been protecting us from angelic attacks. However&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is only because the Empire is paying tribute to Velgrynd-sama, begging her to grant it on a whim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That noble and beautiful crimson dragon is a symbol of the prosperity of the Empire. We, &lsquo;Single Digits&rsquo;, are required to have an audience with that dragon after being accepted by His Majesty Rudra. We must remember her name and face and show her that we will never be hostile to him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, I have performed that ritual myself. Hostility is impossible. It&rsquo;s not an existence one can win against.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So there was a connection between the Empire and Velgrynd, but it seems that the Empire&rsquo;s side could not ask for anything. Also, I was a bit curious about Bernie&rsquo;s reaction. Well, not just a bit, but a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, if you don&rsquo;t want to say anything, you can keep it to yourself, but if Velgrynd and that &lsquo;Marshal&rsquo; you were talking about fought, who do you think would win?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let me rephrase that. Perhaps, did you ever feel similar signs coming from both of them, or did you ever remember something like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie seemed to get my point and tried to laugh it off. But he failed to do so and made a serious face. Next to Bernie, Jiwu was also pondering with a pale face. I was sure of it now. The &lsquo;Marshal&rsquo; was really the &lsquo;Scorch Dragon&rsquo; Velgrynd. The reason why Demon Lord Guy does not attack the Empire is because of Velgrynd. And perhaps the Empire had some other threat as well as Velgrynd. Otherwise, I think Guy would have little reason to stay put. I looked at the big screen and let out a sigh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good grief, A rash move would only provoke Velgrynd, and sending an army against them could result in being annihilated at once. If this is the case, an invasion operation in cooperation with Yuuki&rsquo;s group would only be the height of recklessness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sure enough, information is really important. By becoming aware of Velgrynd&rsquo;s existence, we were able to stop before stepping on a landmine. As tempting as it was to win peace with the Empire, launching a counterattack would only be a fool&rsquo;s errand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Veldora-sama&rsquo;s sister is to be our enemy, who among us could win? Shall we ask Veldora-sama to come?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was Benimaru&rsquo;s statement. As timid as that sounded, this was only the result of calm judgment. A &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo; is an existence that surpasses even the existence of the gods, and those deluded into thinking they can win in a fight were blind to the reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not sure about that. I don&rsquo;t want to involve Veldora in our own affairs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided that I would not ask Veldora to fight with me, as I would not want to fight with my own brother and sister. In that case, I was not entirely sure what to do from here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will have to inform Yuuki boy of this information. I am sure that the army he has deployed will not be able to stay forever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. We need to rethink our strategy and keep in touch with Yuuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmmm&hellip;my mind was racing with thoughts. Just then, Diablo, the troublemaker, dropped a metaphorical bomb.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems that Guy is also involved, so I called him up. He should be here soon, so let&rsquo;s hear what he has to say!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">&hellip;Huh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t help but put on a blank face and stare at Diablo. I was almost ready to kill him when he showed me his bashful expression. What kind of unnecessary thing is this idiot doing to me at a time when things are so troublesome&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You called him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Yes?! No!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was so irritated, but this couldn&rsquo;t be ignored. In any case, I would break up the meeting for now, and prepare for Guy&rsquo;s visit.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

By the way, it&rsquo;s a pretty big deal to call me over, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re right. But alas, I wish you&rsquo;d say that to Diablo, not me. Guy sat down roughly in his chair. I showed him to the luxurious drawing room of the guest house to avoid offending him, but I may have been too hasty. The guesthouse was a place where only royalty and aristocrats were allowed to visit. It would be a great loss if anything went out of control here. The furnishings in the guesthouse were selected by Myourmiles-kun, who was well known for his aesthetic sense. There were also some valuable art works from various countries. The pieces were more modest than showy and were in accordance with my taste. The wabi-sabi atmosphere of the rooms showed the high sensitivity of Myourmiles. Rigurd and his friends were not yet old enough to reach this level. Since they did not have a chance to touch art works, they would not be able to understand the high-end and low-end aesthetics of things so easily. That said, Rigurd had mentioned &lsquo;feeling a sense of home&rsquo; in this place, so we might have the same taste.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyway, let&rsquo;s leave it at that for now and only worry if Guy actually gets out of control. As there was no other room suitable for him, I decided to accept a certain amount of damage. There was no way I could do such a daring thing as to lead Guy, the strongest demon lord, to a common reception room.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The chair was making a small creaking sound. It was carved from aromatic wood of the finest quality. Although soft sofas were nice, the wooden chairs that withstood everything were quite comfortable. They gave off the feeling of being surrounded by the forest and one with nature. I thought in relief that it would be nice to let everyone else leave and just let Diablo make amends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The imperial team was sent back to the 70th floor. Gabil had been assigned as a guide and would take care of Adalmann in his absence. Souei was to arrange for Masayuki&rsquo;s escort. Rigurd was in charge of contacting all the parties concerned to ensure the smooth operation of the city center that had been evacuated in the labyrinth. Kaijin, after consulting with Vesta, asked him to inform King Gazel of the meeting we had just had. I would contact him later as well, since I did not want to hide anything from him. Gadra was to exchange information with Yuuki. He thought it was necessary to communicate the current situation in order to decide the future course of action. Gobta and Hakurou were waiting in the other room. In order to deal with any problems that may arise, the three demon girls were also asked to join the waiting group. It would be safer to keep them out of Guy&rsquo;s way because of what they might do. That was the reason why I took this measure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, four of us moved to the reception room. Me, the culprit Diablo, and then Benimaru and Shion. Guy, on the other hand, appeared with three women. Sitting next to Guy was a woman with a face similar to Milim&rsquo;s. Her lustrous white hair refracted light like a sparkling lake and her eyes were a deep blue. She was a stunningly beautiful woman, but she also seemed a bit young and childish depending on how you looked at her. There was no hierarchical relationship between Guy and herself seeing as she sat down naturally and without any concern. In other words, they were of the same rank, and such an existence was extremely limited. Perhaps she is&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is the first time you&rsquo;ve seen each other. I&rsquo;ll introduce you. This is Veldora&rsquo;s sister, Velzard. Her other name is the Frost Dragon, so you&rsquo;ll have to remember them both.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nice to meet you, Demon Lord Rimuru-sama. My name is Velzard. I wanted to come and say hello to you since my brother seems to be in your care.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was right. She is Veldora&rsquo;s sister and one of the most powerful &lsquo;True Dragons&rsquo;. She was the Frost Dragon Velzard. Her graceful greeting was beautiful. The elegant way she sat on the chair was very picturesque. It seems that she was satisfied with the fragrance of the wood. However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although she showed an elegant smile, I could feel a cold sweat running down my spine. I thought I was familiar with the &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo; race after seeing Veldora every day, but this girl was something else. She was a dangerous woman who felt like a being from another dimension. Veldora had finally been able to control his youki with considerable accuracy pretty recently. I thought it was perfect too, but seeing Velzard-san standing in front of me made me realize that I had been naive. She was controlling her youki in an extremely natural way. The fact that she did not give me any sign of her presence showed just how much control she had over her youki. If I had not been introduced to her, I would never have recognized her as a &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo;. On the contrary, I might have believed her to be a human being. However, I could never have underestimated her, because her beauty and her power could not be hidden.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, hello. My name is Rimuru. I&rsquo;m a demon lord. Your brother has always been a great help to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why do I always greet people like this? And why is the Wisdom King Raphael-san remaining silent at a time like this? One side tried to be friendly to her, while another was thinking this was just irrational.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, dear, you&rsquo;re so modest. You don&rsquo;t have to be so defensive of me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velzard-san chuckled, looking pleased. At that moment, her calm and collected aura faded away, and her image transformed into that of a cute girl. To be honest, she looked just like a high school girl. Once again, I strongly recognized that she was related to Milim. I was saved by her smile as the heavy atmosphere was eased. The greetings proceeded, and we introduced all the respective members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other two were Mizeri the Green Primordial (Vert), whom I had met before, and Raine the Blue Primordial (Bleu), whom I had never met before. They were dressed in dark red maid uniforms as usual, and stood behind Guy without a moment&rsquo;s notice. They seemed to be of the same rank as Diablo and the others, though it didn&rsquo;t seem that way from the way they stepped back. Even so, there was no mistaking a &lsquo;primordial&rsquo;. They were the strongest among the demons, and they were definitely different from mere demon peers. I would be very careful not to get a bad response from them. With such determination, I carefully finished the introductions. Benimaru who sat next to me was fine, but I was nervous when introducing Shion. I felt like I was handling bombs by the time I got to Diablo. I regretted choosing this lineup, but it was too late now.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Shuna understood what was needed and did her job without showing any signs of agitation. No, not just Shuna, but all of the servers were doing their jobs as usual, as if it didn&rsquo;t matter who they were serving. They had become professionals. This was all the result of Vesta&rsquo;s strict training. After taking a break with a cup of tea brought by Shuna, we moved on to the main topic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The reason I asked you to come today is, of course. I wanted to ask Guy something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;Well, the Empire attacked us and we fought them off. And now we were thinking of invading from our side, but then we heard that Velgrynd is</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">ah, your sister is in the Empire too. And judging from the information I&rsquo;ve gathered, I think there might be some kind of a connection between you and the Empire&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve noticed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy grinned happily at my explanation. I had a bad feeling about this. I didn&rsquo;t want to hear any more about it, but I guess that&rsquo;s no longer an option&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been trying to hinder the Empire from increasing its strength. That was your purpose for keeping Yuuki alive, wasn&rsquo;t it? I know that you did not want to destroy Western Nations, but that&rsquo;s not the only reason, right? You mentioned a &lsquo;game&rsquo; before, so who are you playing against?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was concerned about it, but I pretended not to be. However, if Velgrynd was in the Empire, or if a threat of equal magnitude was lurking in the shadows, I couldn&rsquo;t help but ask. If I invaded without knowing about it, there&rsquo;s a good chance that my people would be killed. I looked Guy straight in the eye and asked him the question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukuku, if you&rsquo;ve noticed that much, I&rsquo;ll tell you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy answered without hesitation. I felt scared about that, but I listened to him quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, I made a bet with some asshole. That guy talked so much about crazy ideals that I wanted to show him reality. And so, we decided not to fight each other directly, but to play a game against each other with only the pawns we have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, leaving someone other than yourself to fight and defeating all of your opponent&rsquo;s pawns means you win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The &lsquo;pawns&rsquo; in your hands refers to&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was already aware of it without asking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s you guys.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right. That&rsquo;s what I thought. I wish people would stop using me as a pawn, but I can&rsquo;t start complaining here. Let&rsquo;s just be reasonable and try to get some useful information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, your opponent is the Emperor of the Empire?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure I was right, but I wanted to check. Since Velzard was sitting next to Guy, the one sitting next to Velgrynd must be the opponent of the game. However, that wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the Emperor, so I would have to find out from Guy&rsquo;s mouth exactly who it was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Correct. Emperor Rudra of the Empire is my recognized rival.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy was happy to tell me, as if he had no intention of hiding it. Since he said he was his rival, does it mean that this Rudra is as strong as Guy? He couldn&rsquo;t win otherwise, right? There was nothing worse than participating in a game in which there was no clear path to victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;May I speak?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beside me, Benimaru spoke up without fear. While right in the presence of Guy, Benimaru was amazing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, all right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then allow me to ask, what are the conditions for winning this game? Do you have to defeat Emperor Rudra, or do you just have to conquer all of his pawns?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Oh, well, that was certainly important. I was under the impression that we had to defeat Rudra, but if we could win the game just by neutralizing his pawns</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">in other words, the Empire&rsquo;s forces</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">then we had a much better chance of winning. There were still some nasty guys left, but it was better than facing someone on the same level as Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, one solution here is to get rid of Guy&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo;You idiooot!&rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t help yelling at him, and Guy&rsquo;s angry voice overlapped with mine. It&rsquo;s exhausting, really. Guy must have felt the same way as I did, because we both nodded at one another. I was actually grateful to Diablo for that, because I never expected to relate to Guy in such a way. That said, I&rsquo;d have to take away some points for saying something that could potentially offend Guy. In any case, I told Diablo to keep quiet for a while.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Guy, what about the answer to Benimaru&rsquo;s question?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy looked at me without answering. The moment his mouth broke into a smirk, my Danger Detection sense echoed an alarm in full force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-kun~!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whoa, I have a super bad feeling about this. This was more than just a premonition. I seem to understand why Myourmiles and Veldora always make subtle expressions whenever I call them with &lsquo;-kun&rsquo;. I was sure that I had that very same expression on my face right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, I have a favor to ask you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I refuse.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, just listen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;You listen to me&rsquo;&mdash;is what I wanted to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As tempting as it was, this was still Guy. It was not a good idea to make this arrogant person angry, so I had no choice but to listen to him. Myourmiles-kun, on the other hand, always seemed to be happy to hear from me even with that subtle expression on his face. In my case, I was filled with a desire to reject Guy with all my might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want you to stop that bastard Rudra. I won&rsquo;t ask you to beat him, but just figure out a way to deal with the pawns and make sure I win!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy spoke, looking as evil as ever. He got up out of his chair and walked behind me. Giving my shoulders a squeeze, he continued talking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do it, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hand that rubbed my shoulder grew stronger. Is this a threat?</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="I&#39;LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER YOU CANNOT REFUSE" src="images/image17.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me if I do what you&rsquo;re asking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since I couldn&rsquo;t refuse, I wanted to at least get better conditions. It might be reckless with Guy, but I decided to negotiate as much as I could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know, you&rsquo;re the one who upset the balance of the world I&rsquo;ve been managing. What do you have to say about that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In an instant, I was completely defeated. It&rsquo;s true that I was the one who took most of Guy&rsquo;s forces, even though it was just to build a new balance. To put it more bluntly, it was a bad idea to bring Testarossa and the others to my side. If I refused Guy&rsquo;s request, there was still a danger that I might be regarded as an adversary. There was no way around it. I gave up and decided to accept Guy&rsquo;s offer.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

The door opened and Shuna entered. The smell of tea filled the air, and the tension faded away. There was a cake on the tray, and we decided to take a break. This was definitely not a postponement of the problem, as I had decided that there was no escape now. The two secretaries and the two maids went to the next room, which also had tea prepared. I thought they would be reluctant, but they moved more easily than I expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took a sip of the tea Shuna made with care. It tasted gentle. The one Testarossa brewed was perfect and complete, but this one was very tasty and comforting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ho-ho, this is pretty good, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was glad to hear that Guy was very satisfied with the meal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh my, it&rsquo;s true. This cake is not only sweet, but also has layers of depth. The mellow aroma is wonderful, and the bitterness complements the sweetness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was relieved that Velzard-san seemed to like it as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Also, this room is furnished in a style that is to my liking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Surprisingly, Guy gave me a compliment. I had assumed that he was a tyrant and had no interest in wabi-sabi</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c14">. I needed to reflect on the fact that I should not judge others based on my preconceptions. Come to think of it, I think Oda Nobunaga</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c14">&nbsp;also had this kind of taste. It seems that he liked to spend time in a tearoom where he did not have to worry about his status, and he may have valued that time to reflect on his thoughts. Well, that was just my own contrivance, but it seems that I was right to show Guy to this place. I was a little relieved, so I spoke up to elicit his next reaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, is that so? I&rsquo;m glad you like it. You&rsquo;re the first person I&rsquo;ve shown here. This is the finest parlor we have, and I only show it to people I want to impress.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah? Are you trying to impress me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I am. Without that, one can&rsquo;t be a demon lord. If I could give up my pride, I&rsquo;d have lived happily behind the scenes from the beginning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, a jab. Before Guy&rsquo;s request was heard, I would show him that I would not be at his beck and call. Depending on his reaction, I needed to change my response to Guy. But Guy laughed off my reaction as excessive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahaha. You&rsquo;re trying to get to know me, aren&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re so funny!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t funny, but I still felt like I was being played in the palm of Guy&rsquo;s hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, no trouble. Asking for help is not irrelevant to you. I want you to continue the war and destroy the Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having said that, Guy sipped his tea with a graceful motion. He looked good, like some kind of king. Actually, he&rsquo;s a demon lord, so I guess he is a king. But, Guy&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He went straight to the point there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words, reduce Rudra&rsquo;s pawns to zero without killing Rudra? I had a hunch that it was when you were reluctant to answer Benimaru&rsquo;s question.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. As for the conditions for winning the game, they are not that strictly defined. The only rule we had was that the players must not directly fight each other.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The victory condition is that the opponent must admit defeat, die, or the game cannot continue, whichever comes first, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s going to be.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy nodded his head while sipping his tea again. According to him, Emperor Rudra of the Empire and Guy had been fighting each other for more than 2,000 years. Though they had been fighting, there had been no direct confrontation. They used to fight each other many times before, but after Milim was born and Veldanava, the &lsquo;Star King Dragon&rsquo;, disappeared, they began to be cautious of each other. The reason for this was that their battles had so much impact on the world that they could no longer be serious about them. It sounded far-fetched, but seeing Guy in front of me, I knew that it was not a lie. And so the battle had continued until now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy had been increasing his pawns while keeping the world in balance. It seems that he had been waiting for the slow evolution of many long-lived monsters. However, even among the &lsquo;Octagram&rsquo;, no one knew about Guy&rsquo;s true intentions. Even Milim did not know anything about Guy and Rudra&rsquo;s game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then why are you telling me?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahhh? It&rsquo;s obvious. You&rsquo;re the first person to push Rudra this far.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Needless to say, Guy was aware of the fact that the Imperial Army had been annihilated. Well, it would be strange if Guy didn&rsquo;t notice that since so many large magic attacks had been made&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But you were right to kill them all. Rudra&rsquo;s got no pawns awakened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Do Guy knew the purpose of Rudra&rsquo;s actions after all. Guy told me the exact story. Rudra&rsquo;s purpose was, after all, to make the survivors awaken by giving them an ordeal of defeat. Rudra&rsquo;s basic tactic was to find those who would awaken from among the survivors by giving a reason to convince the subjects, training the army, and then exposing them to threats. As proof of this, the last imperial expeditionary force had been swept away by Veldora, and it was said that some of them had evolved into sages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy had adopted a similar strategy. Those who had not yet awakened were not worth using as pawns. Guy thought that way and he allowed the demon lords to fight with each other. The more people who awakened to become true demon lords, the more advantageous the game became. That was the basic premise of the game, and it was just a matter of timing. The moment you decide that you are definitely better than your opponent, that is the moment to bet. This was surprisingly difficult and sometimes interfered with by the opponent. In that way, the game had continued to be fought without a win until now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For both Rudra and Guy, it was a long story of patience with a grand long-term plan. It was a nuisance to those who lived in this world, but I guess it was just a way to pass the time for both of them&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In this case, too, if there were even a few dozen survivors against Veldora, it was expected that some of them would be awakened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, Rudra didn&rsquo;t care about me. I was just one of Guy&rsquo;s good pawns. It was a little frustrating, but this was the reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, you want me to take this opportunity to attack the Empire?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave that to you. I don&rsquo;t need to say it, but fighting in vain is meaningless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, while disheartening, that was the truth. If the show of force was not a threat, it would only increase the number of casualties and would have no strategic meaning. I rejected the idea of sending an army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you know, then tell me, do you know of any opponents among Rudra&rsquo;s forces that we should be on the lookout for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I was mainly concerned with how well I could play my own cards. If I am the best, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter how strong or weak my opponent&rsquo;s hand is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">It was an arrogant statement befitting of the strong. This guy, he&rsquo;s definitely that type isn&rsquo;t he? He&rsquo;s like a mahjong player who doesn&rsquo;t even look at his opponent&rsquo;s discarded tiles, and just when one thinks they&rsquo;ve got an easy win, he&rsquo;ll pull a yaku mangan</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c14">&nbsp;without a care in the world. Well, Masayuki might get a tenhou</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c14">&nbsp;just with good luck, so I didn&rsquo;t want to play with him either since both of them were the same. The game topic was making me use strange associations, but let&rsquo;s just get to the point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Either way, we need to be clear about the Empire. I&rsquo;m going to do what I believe in, not what you want me to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since we couldn&rsquo;t postpone the problem, we&rsquo;d have to talk to Emperor Rudra. It would be wiser for us to go to Emperor Rudra in a favorable situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, are you planning to go there yourself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru looked surprised, but I was not going to give in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a choice. We can&rsquo;t abandon Yuuki and the others, so we should join them and try to make peace on our own terms.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that dangerous?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Either way, it will be dangerous. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that someone goes out there and does make peace. Would you believe that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wouldn&rsquo;t. I would be convinced that it was just a ruse to throw us off guard. Then they&rsquo;d try to assassinate me in secret when I was out and about. If that happened, I&rsquo;d have to keep my guard up all the time, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to achieve my goal of a carefree life. I would not allow such a thing to happen, so I had to make sure to settle the matter here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. And the escort?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru smiled at my words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His attitude was full of confidence that he could and would protect me. Sure enough, Benimaru was reliable. Guy laughed amusedly at the exchange between me and Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha. You&rsquo;re fun to watch, but your subordinate is fun too. There&rsquo;s something strange about him, and I think he still has a lot of room to evolve.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you know. Benimaru is my most reliable right-hand man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, so it wasn&rsquo;t Diablo?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahhh, that guy is strong, but he&rsquo;s kind of a problem child&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know what you mean.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt that Guy was deeply sympathizing with me. And for some reason, he was even treating me as one of his friends. I understood from his reaction that Guy was also having a hard time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, I just want to confirm one thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rudra can grant Ultimate Skill to others, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy&rsquo;s eyes narrowed in admiration when I asked him this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you noticed. You&rsquo;re right, Rudra does have an interesting skill, and he can lend his power to others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I knew it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, do you know what the terms of the loaning are?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was very important. If Guy knew the conditions, we would be able to narrow down the list of key members on the imperial side. I was wondering if there were less than ten people on the list, but one could never be too sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. His Skill is not all-powerful. He can only lend a limited, degraded power. As for the receiver, one cannot be the recipient of the power unless they have awakened. There are also conditions that I don&rsquo;t know about, but they probably aren&rsquo;t threatening.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy gave me a quick answer when I asked him if he thought it would be a good idea. Now I had all the information I wanted to know. Or rather&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wanted to shout at him that he was the only one who could say that an ultimate skill holder was not a threat. Perhaps Milim was one of Guy&rsquo;s kind too&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such a difference of feelings may complicate things. I was indignant when I saw Guy eating the cake served to him. I was angry at his appearance that didn&rsquo;t match what he said, but I was also annoyed at the way he made things become someone else&rsquo;s problem as soon as I accepted his request. Wait a minute, we were supposed to be talking about something quite important right now. I thought so, but it seemed that the secret talk was over. In frustration, I stabbed a fork into my cake. Sugar was important for thinking. I decided not to be distracted by Guy, but to calmly sort out the information.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

The air is calm. But&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy doesn&rsquo;t seem to be going home, even though his business is over. Shuna deftly poured a refill into Guy&rsquo;s empty cup. It seems that she had prepared a separate pot for serving to prevent the remaining tea leaves from over-brewing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good at what you do! My idiots can&rsquo;t do this much!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you very much for the compliment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru looked a little worried, but Shuna was magnificent. She was not intimidated by Guy and handled him without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My Mizeri and Raine, can I send them to your place for training for a while?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Training?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right. I want them to learn how to make this cake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their food at Walpurgis had been quite good, but Shuna&rsquo;s was a step above the others when it came to sweets. After all, she has been working hard to develop new dishes competing with Yoshida-san, and her skills were getting better and better. I thought that this was only normal, but now I realized that it was quite a luxury. I realized that I had just been doing whatever I wanted since I came to this world. I tried to reproduce what I liked&hellip;I tried to make good food&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how much passion and skill one has, there are recipes that cannot be reproduced without the right ingredients. Even an excellent person like Yoshida-san succeeded in reproducing this cake only with the good quality alcohol produced in our country. For this, I should not forget to express my gratitude. In any case, what should I say to Guy? I thought of telling him to come and buy it, but I guessed there was no need to be so stingy. And so, I decided to tell him only the recipe we developed, while hiding what Yoshida-san told me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shuna, can you show the two people in the next room how to make it later?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, with pleasure!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need to use good ingredients, so let&rsquo;s make a deal on that in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the sugar was refined so that there were no impurities in it. The combination of my dedication to good taste and the technical skills of Kaijin and the others had resulted in a quality that was as good as what I had in my previous life. Although we did not have enough to distribute in the market, we had enough for our own enjoyment. I would add a little more production, and arrange for Guy to have some of it as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I meant it. I was not willing to skimp when it came to our products, let alone our technology. What worried me was that we may have more troubles if Guy went in and out of our country&hellip;but that would not be a problem because he had people like Mizeri who could handle a &lsquo;portal&rsquo;. If we prepared the materials, we wouldn&rsquo;t have to consider the transportation. And, I had other intentions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Guy finds us useful, it will ensure the safety of our country. The deeper our relationship with foreign countries is, the more it will lead to our security. If there was a mutual need, there would be no need to use force against each other. An economic circle was equivalent to a strong military alliance. That was my theory. I didn&rsquo;t want to get into trouble with Guy, so the more cards I had in my hand, the better. After all, I had never been so careful about my opponents before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or perhaps it was the second time, after the time I met Veldora. Whether I could win or not, if we had a fight with them, it would be too much trouble. I was going to respect Guy&rsquo;s opinion as long as it was not too much of a problem. There may be times when Guy would ask me to do something reckless, as he did this time, but I would just have to accept it. But there was a limit to that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After several conversations with Guy, I realized that he was not the tyrant that I thought he was. He was surprisingly rational and understanding. With the way he was dealing with Diablo, I could see his hard-working side. I trusted that he would realize our usefulness and would not make any unreasonable demands. And so, I hoped he would go home soon. My little wish was cruelly scattered by Guy&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait. Before I leave, I need to ask you something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What? What else is going on?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why has Diablo evolved?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Surprise!!! I was hoping it wouldn&rsquo;t be discovered, but I guess that was a little naive. This is why I don&rsquo;t like observant people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What should I do? How do I answer Guy&rsquo;s question?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Diablo isn&rsquo;t the only one either, right? It took me a while to find out the signs because they were in Ramiris&rsquo; labyrinth, but why are there so many awakened &lsquo;True Demon Lords&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy asked me this with a smile, but his eyes were not smiling at all. I guess my poor attempts at deception were not going to work&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. It is safe to say that this is the result of experimentation with the &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo;, the Master&rsquo;s power.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The voice of heaven is here&hellip;!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Okay, let&rsquo;s go with that. As expected of the Wisdom King Raphael-san. Reliable Wisdom King Raphael.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, about that&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with my powers to see if I can strengthen my forces for the decisive battle against the Empire. And it turns out that my powers have an interesting effect.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh. What kind of effect?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What kind of effect does it have? I don&rsquo;t know. Teach me, Wisdom King-sensei!!!</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. This is an effect that reduces souls into energy and grants them to those who are qualified for awakening. Guy Crimson will agree if you explain that this is how the forced evolution is promoted.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re right on the money. Indeed, the evolutionary ritual was not based on the power of the &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; but on the power of the &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo;. So, I was just telling the truth without hiding anything. Indeed, that may be the right response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My power, &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo;, can reduce a person&rsquo;s soul to energy, and I can give it to others. It is a meaningless act for those who are unqualified&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. Does it mean that a person who has obtained the Demon Lord Seed can attain awakening? That&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy didn&rsquo;t need to hear all of it to be convinced, probably because the explanation was not false. All this was thanks to Wisdom King Raphael-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I guess. In this world of warfare, quality triumphs over quantity, right? It&rsquo;s only natural that we should improve our individual abilities.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That makes sense. By the way, I&rsquo;ve always wondered about you, but you&rsquo;re not normal, are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? I&rsquo;m very normal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, no. Ordinary &lsquo;slimes&rsquo; don&rsquo;t even talk. I didn&rsquo;t think much before, but the way you got Veldora to go along with the development of this town, whatever it is, it&rsquo;s not normal. You&rsquo;re a reincarnated person, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? Huh, you didn&rsquo;t know? I died in a different world and was reborn as a slime with my consciousness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy and I stared at each other. It turns out he didn&rsquo;t know. I thought that story had been known for a long time. It was not a secret, rather, it was public knowledge and was well known in the Western Nations. I had assumed that Guy knew about it. It might be a good idea to assume that the other party knows all the information. While not exactly an understatement, I would pay attention to it from now on. I&rsquo;d have to be careful not to give away information by unintentionally offering something unexpected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama is not lying!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hey, come on, why are you so suspicious? Even confirming with Benimaru and Shuna&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahahahahaha! That&rsquo;s awesome! I thought you were an odd one for a monster, but I didn&rsquo;t expect it to be like that. It&rsquo;s rare to be reincarnated to this world, let alone reincarnated as a monster. You&rsquo;ve got no luck at all, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy was giggling like a gibbering idiot. It&rsquo;s not that funny.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But that makes sense. If a soul alone can &lsquo;cross the boundary&rsquo; and keep its ego and memories, then it must be able to train its core. I can also understand why you are so obsessed with your human form, and it&rsquo;s possible that you evolved at an abnormally fast pace and acquired the Ultimate Skill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In short, my mind was strong, was it? I guess so. I&rsquo;m a pretty strong guy, if I do say so myself. I never give up, I never give in, and I always think positively.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hope you can accept it now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I always thought you were shady, but now I know I can trust you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s seriously rude. But I forgive you. Because I can&rsquo;t beat you. Besides, it&rsquo;s better than being treated as an enemy. This is an example of positive thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, it seems your suspicions are confirmed, and you&rsquo;ve heard what you wanted to hear. You probably want to go back&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have another one of these.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was about to ask him to leave quickly. However, Guy interrupted me and brazenly asked for a second cake. Shuna responded in a nonchalant manner. I had no choice but to also ask for another piece of cake. The sweetness of the cake soothed me. I thought so, but Guy didn&rsquo;t allow me to do that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Rimuru-kun, let&rsquo;s get back to the story we were talking about earlier.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can see it. This is definitely a bad thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? What story?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The story of how you awakened your men. From what you just said, it sounded like you could share your power with my subordinates. Is that possible?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This guy&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is he really just like me? For example, the way he&rsquo;s always on the lookout to make the most of everything that&rsquo;s useful. The way he catches you off guard when you&rsquo;re done talking, and then how he just cuts right to the point. No, no, on, I&rsquo;m not as obvious as this&mdash;am I? Well, the moment I start caring about it, I&rsquo;ll lose. More importantly, I have to answer Guy&rsquo;s question. I&rsquo;ll tell him&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. It&rsquo;s possible.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, it answered before I could ask the question in my mind. I felt a little sad. It felt like it was trying to show me how tired it was of dealing with me.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. No such intention.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems a little, well, angry. I didn&rsquo;t want to offend them any more than I already had. I can only put my trust in Wisdom King Raphael-san, and there is nothing I can do if it gives up on me here. Now then, that leaves the question. Guy&rsquo;s servants do not have a Soul Corridor connected to me, is that still okay?</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. Yes. Forced intervention is now possible even for monsters who are not part of the &lsquo;soul lineage&rsquo;. There is a condition that the target does not resist, but as long as it qualifies for awakening, you can promote its evolution by applying energy to it.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Got it. Then there&rsquo;s only one problem left. The number of souls I have. I don&rsquo;t know how many men he wanted to awaken, but it would be impossible if I was missing something vital.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a problem. We won&rsquo;t know for sure until we try, but it should be fine. However, I don&rsquo;t have enough energy left to share.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I answered in such a way that I could refuse Guy without offending him. In fact, I had a little more than a hundred thousand left, but Guy couldn&rsquo;t know that. I was sure he&rsquo;d give up now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh. That means you can do it if you have souls, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s no sign of giving up?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As a matter of fact, I once gave Mizeri about 10,000 souls. But since they didn&rsquo;t react or show any sign of awakening, I decided that it was all for naught.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demons were very dexterous in giving souls, weren&rsquo;t they? But, wouldn&rsquo;t this cause them to awaken?</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. In order to promote evolution, it is necessary to transform the soul into what it should be and adapt it to the target. It is impossible to make effective use of the soul if you just give it to the subject. In addition, the effective value of the soul is about 10 percent, because the energy efficiency is very low when it is given to others.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see. In order for the &lsquo;Demon Lord Seed&rsquo; to germinate, you need to water it correctly. Well, even if you know the right way to do it, whether you can do it or not is another story. In that case, would it be better for my subordinates to awaken voluntarily?</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;No. A monster &lsquo;Named&rsquo; by a higher being will have its nature changed. Even if it is a soul acquired by itself, it will not be awakened.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, the path of evolution is closed when naming occurs. It was hard enough work just to be qualified, but there were unexpected pitfalls. However, most monsters may not be able to qualify, and evolution by naming was also quite common, so it was hard to say if that was a good or bad thing. In any case, a monster who has been named will not be able to extract the energy suitable for itself from the souls it has acquired, because its nature will be different. Guy didn&rsquo;t seem to know that, and I admired Wisdom King Raphael-san&rsquo;s knowledge. It is truly a good teacher.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;&hellip;&hellip;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, no, no, no. I was quite serious in praising it, but it might be taken as more than a compliment. Now that I knew the answer to Guy&rsquo;s question, it was time to move on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So it was Mizeri-san. Is Raine-san another person you tried it with?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you to call them whatever you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That wasn&rsquo;t permission, but an order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that next time. So, about those two guys, weren&rsquo;t you the one who &lsquo;named&rsquo; them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you know about that. That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s the reason why.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems that one&rsquo;s nature is changed when they are named by a higher being.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Hmm. So that&rsquo;s what happened. Then all the souls I gave them were for nothing. So then, you can adapt your energy to the nature of your opponent?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy understood very quickly even though I struggled to explain it to him. Moreover, he was correct without any errors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, I have a favor to ask you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I just knew it would turn out this way. I was starting to get a feel for Guy&rsquo;s personality. Guy was requesting with a purr, but he definitely never thought once that I might refuse&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wanted to refuse him, but I was too afraid to do so. It was too scary, and I had no choice but to listen to Guy&rsquo;s wish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just to let you know, even if you have all the souls needed, you can&rsquo;t evolve if you don&rsquo;t meet the qualifications.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem, both of them have fulfilled the conditions for awakening. So, please awaken them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy described them, saying that they were too useless the way they were. Guy&rsquo;s criteria seemed to be somewhat strange. From what I had heard, Mizeri and Raine are &lsquo;primordials&rsquo; like Testarossa and the others. Saying that they are useless, to say the least&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The more I thought about it, the more I felt uneasy being so close to a certain idiot who would actively agitate Guy. Oh well. All that remained was to see if there were enough souls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Only two people, Mizeri and Raine, need to be awakened, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right. So, how many souls do you need?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the case of self-awakening, the number was 10,000, and in the case of evolving a subordinate through the &lsquo;soul lineage&rsquo;, it was 10x the amount&mdash;100,000. In this case, I had to consider that it would be even less efficient, since they were an unrelated third party. Now then, let&rsquo;s consider the number of necessary&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. 500,000.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Five hundred thousand? 250,000 per person?! 25 times as many as usual, and even 2.5 times as many as those evolved through a soul corridor&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a lot, but if Wisdom King Raphael-san said so, it must be necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think 500,000 souls would be enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? That&rsquo;s all you need? In that case, the amount I have stored up should be enough without killing any more humans.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">You have it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mean, what were you going to do if you didn&rsquo;t have enough??</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, really? W-well, that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All I could do was laugh dryly. If it had come to that, I would have had to desperately try to stop Guy. I was glad that it did not happen, but I had mixed feelings when I thought of the number of victims so far. It was just a difference in values&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I prayed secretly that there would be no conflicts of interest in the future.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5 c11"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I decided that there was no need to hide my conversation with Guy from them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it is, so please go get our guests.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And by the way, there was Shion and Diablo. Guy was in a good mood and eating cake. This was his third piece of cake. He seemed to like it. As soon as he gave me the 500,000 souls, he acted as if his work was done. I already confirmed with Wisdom King Raphael-san that all the conditions were satisfied, but I wonder if it&rsquo;s because I was too narrow-minded to understand what&rsquo;s going on. As I was thinking about this, Shuna came back with Mizeri and Raine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was a very nice cake, Demon Lord Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We are very happy to hear that you are willing to share your recipes with us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">It was Mizeri&rsquo;s gushing praise and Raine&rsquo;s acknowledgment. It seems that the conversation was well communicated to Shuna, whom they were also polite to. If you can be so happy about such a thing, how about </span><span class="c4">not</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;playing a trivial game betting on the world? This world really is full of surprises. These two appeared to be perfect maids. They didn&rsquo;t seem to have the devastating palate of Shion, and they appeared to learn their craft very quickly. But first, they would have to go through the evolutionary rite of passage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The gratitude is received. I hope we can continue to cooperate with each other in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cooperation was the key. I hope they&rsquo;d understand that one-sidedness was not good enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You guys, Rimuru is going to give you power. You should be more grateful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You should too. I swallowed the words and smiled at Mizeri and Raine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As a note on evolution, I think you will be lured into a sleep called the Harvest Festival. It will be hard to return in that state, so you can stay here for a few days.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy and his friends had come using Mizeri&rsquo;s &lsquo;portal&rsquo; to the outside of the labyrinth. From there, with Ramiris&rsquo; permission, they were invited into the labyrinth. It would be difficult to return to the labyrinth after the evolution ritual. I didn&rsquo;t think Guy would be kind enough to take them back to the labyrinth, so I would make sure to prepare a room for them. Besides&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. So please send Guy and Velzard-san home first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the idea. Now that the negotiations had been successfully completed, I would ask Guy to leave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahn? It can&rsquo;t be that much trouble. I&rsquo;ll take those two back, so don&rsquo;t mind them and give them some power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Eh?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy&rsquo;s unexpected reaction almost made me shout in surprise. It was not only me, but even Mizeri and Raine, who were the ones involved, who had a shocked expression on their faces. Their expressions told me that Guy was not going to do anything for them. It meant that Guy had his own agenda. Frankly, it was a pain in the ass. I didn&rsquo;t want Guy to see my power, and I wanted him to go home. I mean&mdash;at this point, something occurred to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had been thinking that Guy and I have some similarities, but perhaps we really were alike. If it were me, I&rsquo;d observe what he was doing and ask Wisdom King Raphael-san to see if I could reproduce it. Even if I couldn&rsquo;t reproduce it, I would need the information to plan countermeasures. From this perspective, there was a high possibility that Guy was planning to do the same thing. If so, I should avoid revealing my plan to Guy even more. Or, perhaps he has already found out?</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. No problem. As you ordered, only &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; is being revealed, so the rest is hidden.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was truly great. As long as I leave it to Wisdom King Raphael-san, even Guy can be fooled. Although, even if that may be the case, I can be too careful. That&rsquo;s why I hope no more information will be leaked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, no, you&rsquo;re welcome to stay. We have plenty of rooms available, so don&rsquo;t hesitate!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was non-negotiable. Guy&rsquo;s goal, no doubt, was to observe my abilities. He couldn&rsquo;t allow me to be the only one to see the cards in his hand. I had to get Guy out of here, no matter what&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy and I smiled at each other, engaging in an intense psychological battle beneath the surface. Just at that moment, the door to the room opened with a bang.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you, Rimuru! The surveillance footage from the Control Room has disappeared, so I need you to bring it back up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! There are people here cooperating with you to monitor the world!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora and Ramiris sounded like they were having fun. However, we were in the middle of a very important discussion, so hopefully they would read the atmosphere. Besides, that was a war strategizing room, not a playroom. Yes, it is still wartime, yet you guys just want to investigate where to play on the big screen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&hellip;</span><span class="c14">And I could go on and on. But right now I can&rsquo;t complain because I was the cause. I had said the other day that we&rsquo;d have fun after the war. Since then, the two of them had been discussing where to go. The two have lived long lives, but surprisingly, they have never traveled around the world. Perhaps it was because they had a longing to travel, but they were even more enthusiastic about this than I was. And so, using my physical magic &lsquo;Argus&rsquo;, the two of them had made it a daily routine to enjoy the scenery of the world in their spare time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The low-cost surveillance magic could be kept active all the time. Moreover, anyone could easily change their viewpoint. It was not possible to project an image from anywhere in the world, but it was possible to project a view over a reasonably large area. However, it was only natural that the magic effect would disappear if it was used too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there later, so please wait quietly until then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would have to instruct them later not to make a fuss when guests were present. This was the responsibility of a parent or guardian. It was important to scold them for their future&mdash;not that I wanted to join them in checking things out. Anyway, let&rsquo;s leave it at that. I&rsquo;m busy negotiating with Guy right now, so I&rsquo;m going to have to kick Veldora out for now&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, isn&rsquo;t that Guy? What do you want with Rimuru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris recognized Guy. Then there was Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;re having fun, Veldora-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;Gaah?! </span><span>Wha-wha&mdash;?! Why are you here, my sister&hellip;?!</span><span class="c14">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought you would have grown up a little, but it seems you are still as noisy as ever. Even so, it is wonderful that you&rsquo;ve learned how to take human form. And you also seem to be in good health for a person who has just been unsealed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;O-oh, you look well too, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The happy atmosphere had changed completely, and Veldora was tense. Velzard seemed to be kind, but Veldora appeared to feel differently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time since we&rsquo;ve seen each other, so I&rsquo;d like to take the time to talk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-no&hellip; I know you&rsquo;re very busy and I have work to do, so I don&rsquo;t have much free time&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Guy and Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s story is going to be a long one, so let&rsquo;s slowly take our time and talk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velzard-san emphasized the word &lsquo;slowly&rsquo;. She was prepared to completely ignore the part where Veldora said he had some work to do. Veldora looked at me as if asking for help. So I, with a strong nod of my head, spoke up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good luck.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, may I borrow the room next door?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could I ever refuse Velzard-san&rsquo;s beautiful smile? No, I can&rsquo;t!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;m sure you two have a lot to talk about, so please take your time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was all I could say. Farewell, Veldora. I will not forget your bravery! Veldora looked sad, knowing that he could no longer count on my help. But his hands moved quickly, grabbing Ramiris swiftly with a firm grip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-Hey, wait, Master! I have nothing to do with this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please! Don&rsquo;t leave me alone!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sight of his pitiful appearance convinced me&mdash;Veldora and his sister must not get along well. Rather than not getting along, it seemed more like fear&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of having trouble getting along with sisters, the same was true of my friend from my previous life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a tyrant&hellip;&rsquo; </span><span class="c14">He used to complain like that with an enlightened look in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess even a &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo; could have similarities to a human. Incidentally, he had been engaged in a fierce match over who was more unfortunate compared to those who were not fond of their younger siblings, but that&rsquo;s none of my business as I only had an older brother. I guess they were both on the same side. Veldora gave off the same feeling as them. This suddenly reminded me of something. I had been having a casual conversation with Veldora at that time. We were arguing about where to travel, and Veldora was stubbornly against the idea of going to the north.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had made some excuse about how it was cold there, but I knew that was unnatural for someone who did not even feel the cold. Now I wondered if that was because he knew Velzard-san was there. As I looked at Veldora, who was gripping the door with a deathly look on his face and desperately begging not to go, I began to feel more and more sorry for him. Although I was planning to abandon him because I didn&rsquo;t want to get caught in the crossfire, I decided to help him a little. But if that didn&rsquo;t work, I would just give up and leave things be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Guy, you guys live further north than the Kingdom of Ingracia, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? Yeah, they call it the &lsquo;Frozen Continent&rsquo; over here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is no longer a habitat for living creatures there because I do not inhibit my mana. Since Guy dislikes the weak, I try to keep them away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not just Guy, but also Velzard, who stood up and put her hand on Veldora&rsquo;s shoulder, turned to me and answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Good</span><span class="c14">, I thought to myself, and asked again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is Velzard-san&rsquo;s power a cold-air type by any chance?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure if &lsquo;cold air&rsquo; is accurate, but it might seem so if just by looking at the results.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see, in that case, there is no doubt. It is surprising that Veldora, who is confident and fearless of the world, would have something he cannot cope with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Veldora is not very good at dealing with Velzard-san, is he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;D-don&rsquo;t be silly! There is nothing I am not good at!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t try to be so tough. Not at a time like this. You&rsquo;ll only cause more damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that right? After all, I&rsquo;ve been taking good care of him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velzard spoke with an impeccable smile. She didn&rsquo;t have the slightest doubt that she was not good at what she did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When the newborn Veldora-chan was on a rampage, I quickly destroyed and regenerated him. When he was reborn and was still rampaging, I stopped his movements and made him quiet, then gave him a gentle sermon. He was a troubled child who couldn&rsquo;t be humanized, so the damage he caused was too much. If I had not cleaned up the mess, things would have gotten even more out of control.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velzard spoke of many past deeds as if to say she had done a very good job. It was hard to listen to the story without tears. No doubt, this was because of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Veldora, you&rsquo;ve been through a lot&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you understand, Rimuru? Do you finally understand me?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, no wonder he developed a sense of bitterness. It was just too bad that she didn&rsquo;t intend to be malicious. If this misunderstanding, or rather Velzard&rsquo;s assumption, was not cleared up, Veldora would be frightened for a very long time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, Veldora was Veldora. It would be impossible for him to resist Velzard with his overweening bravado. If this pretense of strength did not stop, the relationship would not develop well. This kind of matter is a True Dragon type of relationship, right? Well, that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Velzard-san, at the risk of sounding like an interloper, I have to say that Veldora is not very fond of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In a phrase, it is because you&rsquo;re overdoing it. Instead of forcing him to listen to you, he should learn right and wrong on his own by you teaching him what he should do. Even Veldora understands what is right and wrong if we talk to him. So, please, can we stop using violence and just say what we mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I offered Velzard-san to stay the night if she wanted. After a brief silence, Velzard-san sighed and nodded her head. Good. It seems that she has considered my proposal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;R-Rimuru&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good for you, Master! Now hurry up and let me go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand. Come to think of it, I have never heard Veldora-chan&rsquo;s thoughts. Let&rsquo;s take this opportunity to talk about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess they would still be talking slowly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;O-okay, I understand. Please be merciful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora seemed to have regained his composure and was now contemplative. Hopefully, this would eliminate the rift between the two siblings&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time Veldora did not resist and also went to the next room. However, Ramiris was still captured in his hand, which I would pretend I did not see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-Hey, wait! I really have nothing to do with this!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought I heard such a voice, but as soon as the door to the room closed, I couldn&rsquo;t hear it anymore. Deciding that I had only imagined it, I turned to Guy who had remained.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I gulped and waited for his next words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Velzard seems to want to relax, so I guess I&rsquo;ll stay here today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;ll prepare a room for the three of you, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahn? Why are there three of us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, well, because you&rsquo;re going back home, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked him with the hope that he would go home. However, my expectations were betrayed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid. You and me, we&rsquo;re friends. I&rsquo;ll take care of you today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So get going with Mizeri and Raine&rsquo;s evolution&mdash;his eyes spoke eloquently to me. Guy should really get what he deserves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;d rather give you the best of hospitality next time. So for today&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You said earlier that you had extra rooms, right? I&rsquo;m willing to put up with a little bit, so any room that&rsquo;s available is fine by me. I&rsquo;d also like to try that tempura you were talking about.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I lost. Now that he&rsquo;s said all this, there&rsquo;s no way to say no. Rather than refusing and generating displeasure, it would be better to just expose one of the important secrets in my hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay. Then I&rsquo;ll prepare the best room available. And as for dinner, I&rsquo;ll prepare tempura as you requested.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded my head and looked at Shuna.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood. Then, I will prepare it for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna replied with a smile, bowed politely, and left the room. Haruna-san came in instead, and without saying a word, she remained in a corner of the room. Haruna-san was as airy and unobtrusive as a skilled maid herself. Mizeri and Raine also looked impressed, so it seemed safe to say that she was a first-class maid. Guy seemed to be very satisfied with his victory in the battle with me. At that moment, Diablo, who had been silent up until now, opened his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, I see. So you are staying the night then, Guy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahn? Yes, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. Well then, I guess we have plenty of time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You, what are you talking about&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing, I just thought it would be just right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just right? What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have many follow-ups to our earlier discussion I&rsquo;d like to talk about, and I know that you have also boasted about your Ultimate Skill since a long time ago. So today, I&rsquo;d like to ask you about it in detail.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Ooooh!!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nice work, Diablo. The tables have turned and Guy is now on the ropes. I couldn&rsquo;t let this chance pass me by.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, Diablo, show Guy to the inner parlor. You two can spend the rest of the day talking!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you very much, Rimuru-sama. I can only express my gratitude for your kindness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo placed a hand on Guy&rsquo;s shoulder while saying so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, wait, wait!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No more waiting, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy was surprisingly weak when he was attacked this way. He was then taken away in a flash by Diablo, who did not give any indication towards his presence or absence. Diablo really came in handy in unexpected places. Now that Guy was gone, I could use my power with peace of mind. I didn&rsquo;t know when he&rsquo;d be back, so I would have to finish the ritual quickly. I immediately poured the souls into Mizeri and Raine, prompting them to evolve.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Notice. The number of souls required, 100,000, has been achieved. The evolution of individual Mizeri has started.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm? That&rsquo;s strange. I had received 500,000 souls from Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Notice. Evolution of individual Raine has started&hellip; Success.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The total number of souls used was 200,000. Huh? Does that mean I can evolve them even if they don&rsquo;t have a soul connection as long as they are qualified?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&hellip;</span><span class="c14">Hey! There were more questions before getting to that. Did you, with 300,000 left over, mean&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. Due to mastering the procedure, less souls than expected were required.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s definitely not like that, is it? There&rsquo;s no way you can use that excuse when you&rsquo;ve gotten so many souls!</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. Including the requirements for individuals: Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera, it is necessary.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What have you done?! You&rsquo;re so reckless, Wisdom King Raphael-san. Fearless. It actually played a trick on Demon Lord Guy Crimson! No, wait! That means I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s gonna bear the grudge if he finds out about this!</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. No problem.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, it&rsquo;s full of problems. Now I&rsquo;m thinking you&rsquo;re a little too scary. This is why I&rsquo;m afraid of the fearless.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;No. It is just that the level of skill in handling the &lsquo;information particles&rsquo; was higher than expected. The excess is considered to be a reward.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, is that okay? It&rsquo;s a bit of a stretch, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is scarier than committing fraud against the yakuza. If he finds out, I wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to complain before being wiped out. Although I didn&rsquo;t show it on my face, I couldn&rsquo;t stop sweating and trembling on the inside. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve been so thankful for being a slime.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That night we had a banquet. Guy, though seemingly disgruntled, never complained to me. On the contrary, he even thanked me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have a lot to say, but I&rsquo;m already tired today. The evolution seems to have succeeded, so I would like to thank you for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looked really, really tired. I wonder why? In contrast to Guy, Diablo appeared very lively. How strange.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, you&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was wiser not to get involved. I pretended not to notice anything and left the subject unaddressed. He seemed satisfied with the food, and the hot spring also appeared to have put them in a good mood. Velzard was also in good spirits after talking with Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will come back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best to entertain you then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. It is cold in our country, so the hot springs are very soothing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you liked it. I look forward to seeing you again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re a good talker. I hope to see you and Veldora-chan again, and next time, I&rsquo;ll make sure to take my time visiting you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The aforementioned Veldora, however, was nowhere to be seen. It seemed that he had fought briefly with Velzard in the labyrinth and was now wounded all over, unable to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuhaha, kuahahahaha! Tell her that I took it easy on her this time, and I won&rsquo;t show mercy the next time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure you want me to tell her that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He made some excuse with a very quiet voice, but I was kind enough to ignore it. Then again, Velzard-san didn&rsquo;t seem to have fought seriously, so I guess he would recover in a few days from that kind of injury. On the other hand, it was the first time for me seeing Veldora injured, and I was reminded of the strength of the existence of &rsquo;True Dragons&rsquo;. The Empire also had another sister of Veldora. In order to think of a proper countermeasure, I decided I would ask Wisdom King Raphael-san to show me information on the battles between the True Dragons later on.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

We would resume our discussion on the future plans, referring to the information. I was so enthusiastic, and then someone came to me in a hurry. It was Myourmiles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, Rimuru-sama! There you are. I&rsquo;ve been looking for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, why are you in such a hurry?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can be in a hurry if necessary. My elder sister is here. She wants me to call Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Big sis?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was surprised and rushed out to meet them. The destination was a certain ryokan in a prime location. It was always there that big sis would come. &lsquo;Big sis&rsquo; was a code word, understood only between me and Myourmiles. That&rsquo;s right, it was only because calling that person directly by name would create some problems that we called her &lsquo;sister&rsquo;. That person, of course, was Elmesia El-Ru Sarion, the emperor of the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Dynasty of Sarion. Another alias for her was &lsquo;El&rsquo; from our &lsquo;conspiracy trio&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was Rimu. Myourmiles-kun was Gar. Elmesia-san was El. In terms of hierarchy, El was the top and I was the second. Gar was the third, and we were all excitedly involved in certain matters. Since it was El who summoned me, there was no choice but to rush over. However, she should have known that it was wartime&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We are in the middle of a war right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I told her. She even mentioned that the next time she would come back would be after things settled down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, Myourmiles-kun spent much more time with Elmesia-san than me. He had been negotiating with Elmesia-san on my behalf because of my busy schedule. This was both the front and back side. By &lsquo;front&rsquo;, I meant the official diplomatic relations with the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Dynasty of Sarion. I myself had nothing to do with it and left everything to Myourmiles-kun and Rigurd. The progress of construction and logistics arrangements, arrangement of tariffs and other rights, as well as security of each other&rsquo;s merchants and visitors were all examined. The process was repeated over and over again until arriving at mutually acceptable terms. They worked hard and without complaint through such a tedious process of negotiation. On the other hand, the other side of our relationship (the &lsquo;back&rsquo;) had to do with our darker deeds, in which we, the conspiracy trio, were in our element. It may sound less than savory, but the contents were indeed true. Just what were our darker deeds? It was our plan to take control of the newly born giant economic circle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, the three of us had just been drinking buddies. But then we soon began to discuss business matters, and before we knew it, we were even discussing important matters of national management. It had been my fault for being so loose with my words, but Myourmiles-kun was just as guilty for not stopping us. Besides, we were not the only ones at fault, Elmesia-san also revealed a lot of secrets to us. We couldn&rsquo;t afford to let our guards down. The three of us blamed it all on the alcohol.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This relationship was, of course, top secret. A secret between the three of us. Absolutely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If anybody found out that we had been talking like this, they would be very angry with us. I would be silently pressured by everyone, and Myourmiles-kun would probably be blamed to the point of stomach perforation. Elmesia-san would no doubt get some sarcasm from Elalude and the others as well. And so, the three of us were powerfully united. As a conspiracy trio, we had formed a friendship that transcended our positions.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Our relationship began in earnest when we won the battle against the Rosso family. At the time when the Rosso family was in decline, the underground organizations behind the Western Nations were in a state of collapse. With no one to coordinate them, they began to appear as a rivalry of rivalries. I had ordered Testarossa to maintain security, so there was not too much confusion, but it was not a situation that could be left unattended. Only when the police</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">or rather, the military</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">of each country was unable to handle the situation were they allowed to help secretly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem was how to deal with the criminals. The reason why the military of each country could not handle them was because of the retaliation from the criminal organizations. In some cases, the local lords were even the head of the criminal organizations, and they were hesitant to reveal their crimes to the public. Of course, the crimes could not be allowed to go unchecked, but if they were pursued, civil war might break out. For fear of such a situation, the state could not interfere. There were many situations in which the state had no choice but to tolerate the crimes. I was troubled by this situation and complained to Elmesia-san, who frequently stayed at the hotel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wish you would consult me on something more pleasant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, Elmesia-san was reluctant to give me a detailed explanation, but as she listened to my words, her eyes gradually changed and she leaned forward to give me a detailed explanation. What I had stated, in other words, was beneficial not only to me but also to Elmesia-san. Or rather, I had been telling her such dream-like things, trying to get her interested in it. Economy and crime were inextricably linked. The gap between the rich and the poor, the widening of the gap would cause envy, and it may even affect the reign of the government. Criminal organizations would be fattened up as a receptacle for the poor, and this may be a cause of disturbance of the nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles-kun used to be a don of such an underworld. He understood what I was explaining to him. The important thing was to prepare a place for the poor. It was important to provide a job that anyone could do, so that no matter how many people dropped out, they would not have to commit crimes. That was usually the military. There were a wide range of jobs in the military, and they were always looking for people to do them, but if the nation was poor, they were not able to do them. And so, we were going to support them from the shadows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;First, we create a criminal organization. We have already laid the groundwork by absorbing the organizations we have destroyed in various countries. We can round up all the organizations that are currently kept at bay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had spoken in a drunken stupor, but this had succeeded in attracting Elmesia-san&rsquo;s interest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. There is no organization in Western Nations that can compete with the secret society Cerberus. I guess many of them would be loyal to the organization if they were given food, clothing, and shelter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To Elmesia-san, who had been reluctant to join the meeting so far, the next statement was the decisive factor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right? In this way, now that the poor are taken care of, the next step would be to deal with the rich.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that Granbell is gone, there is no doubt that the Rosso family will be in decline. The organization that is strong now will be weakened in time. My project is going to take its place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A project? Let&rsquo;s hear it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. As previously mentioned, the Kingdom of Blumund could function as an industrial agglomeration. Fuze-dono is also making preparations and has already secured the necessary manpower.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles was also consulted about this great idea. It was important to coordinate interests with neighboring countries in order to achieve co-existence and co-prosperity. The Dwarven Kingdom&rsquo;s industry, the Kingdom of Farmenas&rsquo; agriculture, and the Sarion Dynasty&rsquo;s industry. These industries would flow into the Kingdom of Blumund, although they&rsquo;d need to be coordinated so that they would not compete with each other. And then, through this window, they would spread to the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, Elalude-chan reported that. Are you really going to implement that plan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, where are you looking for the benefit, Rimu-chi?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The profits are secondary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m kidding! We are what we are. We&rsquo;ve got the core technology, and we&rsquo;re going to release it. For example, to build a large university campus city and attract the best students from all over the world. We&rsquo;re going to make tourism a pillar of our country, but secretly sneak around behind the scenes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wahahahaha! Patents, the patents! A dream system that brings in money even if you don&rsquo;t work! I understand the concept itself, but it will be difficult to make it known.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. So you develop products that cannot be made without using the technology, and secure intellectual property rights!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;El-tan, you are very perceptive! I appreciate your quick response, but don&rsquo;t copy me, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;First come, first served, right? And no! Rather than copying you, let me have a piece of the action.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wahahahaha! If you cooperate with us, this project is as good as a success!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh my, Gar-chan. That&rsquo;s true, but don&rsquo;t praise me too much!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The drinking party was a lot of fun. And then came the next day. The three of us looked at one another, regretting that we had said too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, about yesterday&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I remember. Well, you blurted out some things you shouldn&rsquo;t have said, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please, please, please keep this a secret. I can&rsquo;t have this project going down the drain here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that now, Gar-chan. I&rsquo;ll keep my promise, even if it was made in a drunken stupor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, we were united by a failure of a drinking session.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">From there we began pushing the project forward. With two heads of superpowers in the same room, things moved along swiftly. The domination of the West proceeded under the radar at a pace that would be surprising to anyone else. In just a few months, the unification of criminal organizations was completed. The secret society &lsquo;Three Drunk Sages (Riega</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c14">)&rsquo; was born.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The members of the society were puzzled about the origin of the name &lsquo;Three Drunk Sages&rsquo;, but that was not our concern. That was off topic, so we would leave it at that. The main issue was the progress of the project. The poor who had been oppressed in various countries had been taken in by the mysterious secret society &lsquo;Three Drunk Sages&rsquo;, which was an emerging force. After a month or so of aptitude tests, the right people for the job were selected. If they were judged to be particularly talented, they were invited to our country for formal study.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda Atlee was the one who was imposed with such a troublesome task. She used to be one of the &lsquo;Three Martial Sages&rsquo; and now worked for Souei. She had been playing the role of a pushy boss, as she had said that she would do anything, even the dirty work. As for Glenda&rsquo;s subordinates, there was Girard, the leader of the mercenary group &lsquo;Apostles of Verte&rsquo;, and Ayn, a spirit wielder who was his subordinate. These two were also active in the Western Nations, and they were good at uniting the ruffians. They were well known in the underground world and supported Glenda.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone seemed to think that &lsquo;Three Drunk Sages&rsquo; referred to these three people. The truth is that it was honestly referring to three drunkards, but since this was misinterpreted as one with &lsquo;drunken dreams&rsquo; or something cool like that, I would let the truth stay buried in my heart. That was the underworld.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Next, there were the organizations that were active on the surface. If we left things to one organization, a breeding ground for corruption would inevitably fester. To avoid this, it was better to have opposing organizations side by side.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">Because of this, we decided to prepare two organizations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first one was a new organization that Myourmiles-kun was in charge of. It was based on the employees trained in the Kingdom of Blumund, and was engaged in commercial activities in cooperation with the council. Its official name was the &lsquo;Four Nations Trade Federation&rsquo;. With Tempest as the head, the Kingdom of Blumund, the Kingdom of Farmenas, and the Dwarven Kingdom were all members of this organization. Because the representative was Myourmiles-kun, it was known that I was involved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second was the Western Nations&rsquo; Federation Chamber of Commerce, which Elmesia-san was working for behind the scenes. With the financing of King Dolan and his kingdom carrying the banner, the surviving members of the Rosso family had been absorbed. Because we mainly concentrated on those with strong hostility towards us, a larger force than expected had been born. This organization was officially called the &lsquo;Western General Trading Company&rsquo;. The representative was one of the sons of King Dolan who seemed to be an excellent man who had inherited the Rosso blood. Only King Dolan and his son, Prince Figaro Ross Dolan, knew about Elmesia-san&rsquo;s involvement. They agreed to our plan on the condition that they would be protected by Elmesia-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">&lsquo;In the Rosso family, we must be flexible in our thinking to survive. If the demon lord, who will be the supreme ruler of this world, and the emperor, who will have a great influence on the world, have joined forces, the decision not to give in will only mean destruction.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was apparently King Dolan&rsquo;s first words when he was told of the plan. The Rosso family was a family that valued contracts. It was believed that this relationship would be maintained as long as both parties fulfilled their covenants. Incidentally, Elmesia-san and my shares together added up to 61 percent of the Western General Trading Company. Since Elmesia-san was the largest shareholder, the moment Figaro betrayed me, it would mean the collapse of the entire trading company. Elmesia-san told me that she did not think Figaro, who was a good man, would make such a foolish choice. I agreed with her opinion, so I decided to trust Figaro and let him be the representative director for the time being.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this way, the two organizations began their activities at the same time. On the surface, these two organizations were hostile adversaries. They competed with each other for prices and distribution, but it was a healthy competition under the law, without the need of force or intervention. Some cowardly people tried to take advantage of the underworld, but they somehow ended up in a lot of pain. A report from the &lsquo;Three Drunk Sages&rsquo; mentioned that something strange was going on. I didn&rsquo;t dare to stop them, but I hoped they would understand that overdoing things could bring misfortune.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As sad as it is that some people used excessive tactics, both parties seemed to be motivated enough to do so. Both were growing faster than I had expected. In just a few months, the organizational structure seemed to have stabilized. Each side had been subdivided into positions, and the ranks had been established. Even now, when we were being attacked by the Empire, I heard that they were prospering from the special war demands. It was a bit much to be so business-minded, but the profits would be returned to me, so I should consider it as a necessary evil. I didn&rsquo;t think it was right to say that everything should be regulated. Well, in this case, I had my own interests, so I thought so even more. And so, control of the economic circle was getting closer and closer to completion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that Elmesia-san had come first unscheduled undoubtedly meant that there had been an emergency. If I had to guess, I would say that Prince Figaro had betrayed us. I had already devised a countermeasure in that case, but I would have to contribute my share to the fund. No wonder Elmesia-san came to see me.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

What&rsquo;s up today, El?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, no speculation was necessary. I decided to hear what she had to say. Elmesia-san was in a bad mood. She looked at me with a glare, not even trying to hide the fact that she was upset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-Huh? What is it? Are you in a bad mood?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course! You&mdash;do you even understand what you&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whoa, whoa! She seems to be very serious, doesn&rsquo;t she? And apparently, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be related to the &lsquo;Three Drunk Sages&rsquo;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-what does that mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not a good idea to offend Elmesia-san who had a very sharp glare, so I sat down on the tatami. Myourmiles-kun was also sitting on the tatami next to me. Unlike me, he seemed to be in a lot of pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimu-chi, is it true that you have evolved some of your subordinates?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Why does she know about that?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I glanced at Myourmiles-kun with a sideways glance and tried to get an answer from him, but he gestured that he did not know by frantically shaking his head. In that case, where did this leak come from?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I received an urgent message from my boy Gazel. He debated whether to tell me or not, but in the end, he decided this should be communicated. He&rsquo;s very disciplined, that boy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Elmesia-san&rsquo;s point of view, even that old man Gazel was treated like a child. But I didn&rsquo;t know about that. I guess it was not surprising that he did not hide it from her, but the speed of information transmission was unexpected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Eastern Empire was looking worse than I thought, so I wanted to reinforce everyone. Then, I thought it would be worse to hide it, so I invited Jaine-san too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, so it&rsquo;s true&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elmesia-san stood up, turned her back to me, and looked out the window. Her back seemed melancholy, and she seemed sad for some reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Why are you nodding your head as if this is none of your business?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a snap, Elmesia-san hit my head with her fan that she pulled out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-no, no, I didn&rsquo;t mean&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I just wanted to lighten the heavy atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you trying to do with such a large force?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not anything, really. Just trying to build a country where people can live happily.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My boy Gazel told me that you have another &lsquo;primordial&rsquo; in your crew besides Diablo, is that right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t tell you? I was also surprised when I found out recently. You know Testarossa, don&rsquo;t you? I had thought she was very strong, but it turned out that she was one of the &lsquo;primordials&rsquo;. And there are two more&mdash;Carrera and Ultima, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the Attorney General of our country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was explaining this, Elmesia-san began to tremble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that is also true&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After muttering like this, Elmesia-san sat upright in front of me and stared straight at me. Then she bluntly asked me a question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you trying to destroy the world?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-no way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way people on the outside can see it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She yelled at me. I started making excuses in a panic. Myourmiles-kun joined me in support and then we exchanged words for about 30 minutes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You mean Guy and Rudra are playing a game with each other&rsquo;s pawns to decide the winner?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that right, Gar?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t know the details of the situation. But in any case, this isn&rsquo;t really something I should know about.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be, but it can&rsquo;t be helped, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;It is difficult for me to be satisfied with just </span><span class="c4">&lsquo;it can&rsquo;t be helped&rsquo;</span><span class="c14">&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I know, right? I totally got you into this. Honestly, I&rsquo;m sorry, okay? But I&rsquo;m sure that because Myourmiles-kun and I are good friends he&rsquo;ll forgive me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah, well now I know what happened. You can&rsquo;t say no to Guy if he threatens you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, that&rsquo;s it! I was threatened by Guy&mdash;let&rsquo;s call it what it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right? That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s been hard for me too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles-kun&rsquo;s tone had shifted, but I think I can cover it up now. Elmesia-san let out a sigh. She seems to have recovered her composure, perhaps because her anger has been lifted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what are you going to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-what do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not someone who will just play as Guy&rsquo;s pawn, are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going to be nice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I thought about it, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elmesia-san didn&rsquo;t understand what I was thinking so I told her frankly. There would certainly be powerful men of unknown strength waiting for us in the Empire. Avoiding a battle at this point was one way, but I thought it would only postpone the problem. I would have to live constantly alert for a long time, wary of assassins from the Empire. There would be skirmishes with assassins, and even if I was careful, there would be casualties. In order to avoid such a situation, I wanted to take the initiative. To begin with, the war for the Empire was a ritual to create awakened beings. If so, we would have to keep on fighting with them. Ignoring them would only give them more time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my decision. I&rsquo;m going to go in with just my main force to negotiate for peace because there&rsquo;s no point in having the numbers. If we can deal with Rudra&rsquo;s pawns there, Guy will take care of the rest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The truth is that I don&rsquo;t trust Guy, and I didn&rsquo;t expect that much from him. The problem was who to take with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, are you going to be okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Myourmiles-kun&hellip;who do you think I am? I may look like this, but I&rsquo;m still a part of the Octagram. Emperor of the Empire or his imperial guard, they won&rsquo;t be a match!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! As expected of a goddess&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? Goddess?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&hellip;he still sees me that way? He caught me staring at him and reiterated in a panicked manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">you&rsquo;re a reliable demon lord, Your Majesty!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;O-oh. Well, you can count on me then! Hahaha!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wahahaha!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We laughed out loud. As nice as that sounded, I was planning to run away and come back if things got bad. I was prepared to shut myself in at that time, so it was useless to think about things too hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ho&hellip;can you tell me about whether you will eliminate Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s men or murder his own lord or father?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t like it when people asked questions on the assumption that I was going to win, but I had already decided on this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying not to kill. Judging from the game&rsquo;s win condition, Guy wins when all but Rudra are neutralized. From that point on, it&rsquo;s not my problem to interfere with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elmesia-san nodded her head in satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, I understand. Do your best not to disappoint us. In the case of an emergency, I will take care of your country too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Stop! Don&rsquo;t say such ominous things!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry! I hate self-sacrifice! My motto is to live happily together, and I have no intention of dying!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elmesia-san laughed happily when she heard my reply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Take heart and remember that if you die, this world is doomed. There is no other monster who could tame Diablo and the other primordials. The demon lords you&rsquo;ve created may not all agree with you. If conflicts arise, wars will inevitably break out. Do you understand? Don&rsquo;t give up on anything that you plan to do. Don&rsquo;t ever forget it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Elmesia-san&rsquo;s heartfelt advice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know. I really do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why I also swore to do so with a serious expression on my face.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle was in the endgame. A few more moves and we would win. But at this point, one wrong move could turn everything around. We had to be calm and careful. First, I needed to contact Yuuki and discuss how to deal with Emperor Rudra. And so, the next day came. We embarked on a journey to the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.2et92p0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c19" id="h.y8y4ol1ld1dn"><span class="c10">Interlude 2</span></h2><p class="c35"><span class="c20 c14">The Heavenly Game</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">This is a record of the war. A heavenly game that had played out over many years. It was a battle of supremacy on earth between a demon lord and a brave warrior. However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For &lsquo;Scorch Dragon&rsquo; Velgrynd, such games were meaningless. She was not interested, so it did not matter to her who won. She thought it would be better to fight directly to decide who was the winner rather than participating in such troublesome games. However, the direct confrontation between Guy and Rudra was still unsettled, even though they had fought many times. That is why this game was started, with the only rule being &lsquo;no direct confrontation&rsquo;. Although she couldn&rsquo;t complain about it, Velgrynd was still dissatisfied with the game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">To begin with</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">if she was being honest</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">she thought this game was disadvantageous. Guy&rsquo;s only chance to beat Rudra was with Velzard, and conversely, if she could manage to defeat Velzard, they would win the game. The same could be said for Guy. There is no one who could defeat Guy except for Velgrynd. Nevertheless, Velgrynd thought that it would be difficult for her to beat Guy. Velzard had a chance to beat Rudra, but she herself would have trouble defeating Guy. That was the reason why Velgrynd thought this game was disadvantageous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Alas, it&rsquo;s such a pain in the ass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the truth. Velgrynd, who disliked elaborate stratagems, was not good at the meticulous actions that had taken hundreds of years to prepare. Therefore, she left everything to Rudra and simply followed his lead. Nevertheless, as long as Rudra wanted to win, Velgrynd was willing to cooperate. She would fight if she was called upon to do so. He would take a lot to make sure that Velzard could be taken down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy was undoubtedly the strongest demon lord, and her sister the &lsquo;Frost Dragon&rsquo; Velzard, was the worst type of match-up for Velgrynd. They were like natural enemies, and it would be difficult to win in a head-to-head match. If Velzard and Velgrynd fought, at best they would fall together, and at worst Velgrynd would be forced to reincarnate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, even that was just an optimistic speculation. Velgrynd&rsquo;s attribute was heat. In contrast, Velzard&rsquo;s attribute was ice. In other words, they represented the opposing factors of &lsquo;acceleration&rsquo; and &lsquo;deceleration&rsquo;. If the two were to fight seriously, the result would be disastrous. Neither side would survive and both sides would fall. In other words, there was a strong possibility that both of them would be wiped out. In that case, both would be reincarnated, but their current selves would be lost. While they would inherit memories, they would become different people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was afraid of this. It did not matter if she disappeared, but she did not want to lose her love for Rudra. Velgrynd couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at herself for clinging obsessively to such a trivial emotion as love. A complete victory was the prerequisite for the safety of herself and Rudra. That is why she needed insurance. However, this insurance had been difficult to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Really, that guy is such a pain in the ass, isn&rsquo;t he? It seems he was lucky enough to be unsealed, but why doesn&rsquo;t he come to say hello?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd, not realizing that she was greatly feared, was frustrated with her &lsquo;insurance&rsquo; Veldora. If this was the Veldora that Velgrynd knew, he would have already begun rampaging all around the world. However, he seemed to have become very close with the new demon lord. When she heard that he had even joined the Walpurgis, she suspected that he had gone crazy after being sealed for so long. Still, she did not think that Veldora, who loved chaos, would remain silent before an army of a million. That is why she was sure he would come out, but the result was surprising. Even then, he had remained hidden in the depths of the labyrinth and did not show himself. This was unexpected for Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">That kid really does whatever he wants&mdash;but why didn&rsquo;t he come out this time?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As was the case on the last expedition, Veldora did not like to have his territory invaded. It was believed that an encounter with Veldora would be inevitable after the invasion of the Great Jura Forest. And that was exactly what Rudra wanted. For Rudra, what&rsquo;s important was not a strong army but rather individuals who transcend their limits. Last time, the few who survived had succeeded in evolving. Surrounded by resentment, fear, and despair&mdash;Only those who did not lose hope under such extreme circumstances could break through the chains of humanity and reach a higher realm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if an army of a million were to be annihilated, it was still profitable if a few were awakened. This was Rudra&rsquo;s opinion, and Velgrynd agreed with it. The reason why he did not disclose the detailed information from the intelligence was to motivate the corps commanders by misleading them. From Velgrynd&rsquo;s point of view, the confidence of the corps commanders was even comical. The chances of the plan working were slim. Or rather, it could even be said there wasn&rsquo;t a chance at all. It was impossible to defeat Veldora with an army that had been reinforced by science. Therefore, there would be many deaths this time as well. But that is what gave them hope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Fufufu, I wonder how many will survive and awaken this time. The more people who will be on the receiving end of Rudra&rsquo;s power, the greater the chance of winning. I am looking forward to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd thought as such, but was left speechless by the unexpected result of the expedition.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve seen that look on your face.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t joke. I did not expect such a heavy defeat to the extent that no one survived. In that case, we have failed in our goal to acquire those who awakened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Allowing the generals gain as much experience as possible, and then gain at least one powerful being into the Imperial Knights. The hidden purpose of the expedition was to bring out the awakened beings from among them. And yet, there were no survivors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a story on a level even worse than if Veldora had destroyed them. The possibility of human evolution would increase only if one could survive and taste the despair of touching a portion of the most powerful force in this world. It was an expedition with a large army just for that purpose, but it was meaningless if there were no survivors. Moreover, it seemed that several Imperial Knights who had been embedded in the expedition had all disappeared. This was just a waste of precious resources and overall a great loss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s how it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Rudra&rsquo;s reply was curt. Velgrynd was dissatisfied with this, but stopped being angry when she looked into Rudra&rsquo;s eyes. There was an intense frustration in his eyes. Velgrynd realized that Rudra felt the same way.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">And so, Velgrynd changed her mindset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The loss of a legion did not matter to Velgrynd. It would have been a great achievement if an awakened person was born, but it did not matter if they failed, as it was in this case. That said, they could not ignore the existence that had made this happen. If one million soldiers of the Imperial Army had been annihilated, the strength of the opponent could not be underestimated. They had to know who did it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, did that kid (Veldora) do it this time, too?&rdquo; Velgrynd asked, regaining her composure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd had been completely oblivious to Veldora&rsquo;s rampage. However, there had been a report that Veldora had destroyed the 20,000 troops of Farmus&rsquo; army. At that time, the information bureau had not been able to obtain detailed information, but this time was different. Everything should be known, and Velgrynd, the &lsquo;Marshal&rsquo;, would be informed shortly. The reason why Rudra knew first was because of his power. Therefore, Velgrynd waited for Rudra&rsquo;s answer with great confidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Velgrynd&rsquo;s estimation, it was unlikely that her chaotic brother would miss the opportunity to go on a rampage. She expected that if she attacked with an army of a million men, Veldora would surely come out. In that case, she was planning to observe Veldora&rsquo;s power. Following those thoughts, she would be able to confirm whether he could control his youki to a degree that he could make himself imperceptible. Veldora&rsquo;s growth was a joy for Velgrynd. Although he was a foolish little brother, Veldora was a lovable presence to Velgrynd. However, he was also a nuisance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">We cannot let him join Guy&rsquo;s side, and must make him an ally in any case</span><span class="c14">&mdash;Velgrynd thought as such, and was always thinking of how to do so. It was very important for Velgrynd to know how Veldora was progressing. However, she had no idea how much Veldora had grown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is not the case. And, surprisingly, we don&rsquo;t have a detailed picture of the situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra told Velgrynd everything he knew. He began with the heavy defeats of the first battle, then continued with the fact that the troops who entered the labyrinth did not return, and finally he spoke of the great magical sweep of the city. There was also the awakening of Calgurio and the outcome of the battle. And how the Armored Corps were defeated, exactly as it had been seen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You must be lying, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. All four of the remaining &lsquo;primordials&rsquo; were helping on Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s side. If those demons are going to run rampant, then your brother will have no place in it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The balance of the game has been shifted. Is Guy upset about this? Or is this just what he wants?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, perhaps. If this is what Guy wants, we have to admit that the situation has become overwhelmingly unfavorable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Rudra chuckled with a bitter smile. Over the years, they had built up their forces and prepared for the best timing. Remain patient, do not be reckless, and fight steadily. And yet, in the blink of an eye, someone had amassed an unimaginable force. It was a small entity that had not even been considered</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">the &ldquo;newbie&rdquo; Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Now there is no choice but to admit it</span><span class="c14">&mdash;Velgrynd thought as such, and was secretly determined to fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, when you said you didn&rsquo;t have a detailed picture of the situation, did you mean that you couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was going on inside the labyrinth?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu, yes, that&rsquo;s right. It is a pity that even with my power, I am unable to break Ramiris&rsquo; power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing his answer, Velgrynd was convinced. &lsquo;Fairy of the Labyrinth&rsquo; Ramiris was an untouchable being. She was not a referee of the game, and she was definitely not involved on the board. That is, until now. This time, she was completely in favor of Demon Lord Rimuru. It had nothing to do with the game with Guy, but she was going to deal with the Empire that had invaded the Great Jura Forest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris herself was not very powerful. Velgrynd also thought that Ramiris herself was negligible and would have no effect on the game. However, the power of her &lsquo;Labyrinth Creation&rsquo; must have had the effect of blocking information inside and outside. Velgrynd felt like clicking her tongue at such a troublesome power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ramiris must have lost her &lsquo;mediator&rsquo; powers, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. That one&rsquo;s labyrinth seems to be the best place to hide secrets, though we had neglected it until now because it was not a threat. Until now, I have been able to see through the eyes of Bernie and Jiwu&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Suddenly you can&rsquo;t see them anymore?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was probably a ploy to catch me off guard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying. If that&rsquo;s true, then this is trickier than I thought&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd also understood the gravity of the situation. In other words, they didn&rsquo;t know what had happened in the labyrinth. Normally, one would think that Veldora had done something, but it felt to Velgrynd that there was more to it than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The problem is that there are several powerful beings hiding in the labyrinth. The most prominent one is your brother, though I wonder how much he has been tamed by this newcomer&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he would follow someone else&rsquo;s orders quietly, given his personality. Not to mention, I doubt one would be able to bind him with a Skill, either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although they had heard that he was cooperating with Demon Lord Rimuru, Veldora was not the kind of person who would do anyone&rsquo;s bidding. He even defied the words of Velgrynd and Velzard, his sisters, so she was sure that it would be impossible for him to follow someone else by force. If that was the case, did this mean that Demon Lord Rimuru had prepared something that could bend Veldora to his will? Velgrynd thought about this and tried to imagine what it could be. But nothing came to mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">If such a thing existed, we wouldn&rsquo;t have had to go through all this trouble. Perhaps we should ask Demon Lord Rimuru directly?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, Velgrynd gave up thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have to hear it from his own mouth to be sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing Velgrynd&rsquo;s mutterings, Rudra also laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess so. I&rsquo;m glad to see that you came to the same conclusion I did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The demon lord named Rimuru had become a presence they could not ignore. Considering the means by which he had taken the &lsquo;primordials&rsquo;, they could be sure that he had Veldora at his beck and call somehow. If so, they decided that it was necessary to turn him away from Guy&rsquo;s side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now would be a good time to make a move. Now that our plan has failed, Guy may be caught off guard. I don&rsquo;t doubt that the long-winded demon lord will wait for the next opportunity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. All this time, you&rsquo;ve been so cautious, taking no chances. It&rsquo;s not a bad idea to make a move at once here, putting aside any hesitation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was delighted. Rudra was determined to settle the score with Guy. The time for quiet was over. Velgrynd&rsquo;s move on this occasion would give her a chance to take control of Veldora at once. With this momentum, she would destroy the new demon lord named Rimuru and head for an all-out confrontation with Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufufu, you can count on me. I&rsquo;ll go out there and let loose, and then all you&rsquo;ll have to do is pick up the pieces. I believe in you, Rudra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. As long as we have Veldora, whatever happens next is out of the question. Tatsuya seems to have come up with an interesting plan, so that should make up for our failure this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she challenged them head on, even the most troublesome primordials would be no match for Velgrynd, a True Dragon. It would be troublesome if they ran out of control later, so if they defied them, they would just have to clean them up together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">There might be others that could be a problem, but as long as I&rsquo;m personally involved, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd exuded confidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shall I make some fools bleed as a warm-up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who disobeyed Rudra were arrogantly gathering around. They have kept them at bay until now, but that would end today. The fools who planned the coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat against the Emperor would have had no choice but to die. Velgrynd thought so and said as such, but Rudra grinned and shook his head. Then, he gave a surprising answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want them alive, not dead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s unusual. I would have thought you would have given them a quick and painless death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, Tatsuya&rsquo;s plan requires it. He wants to start another big battle to get Guy&rsquo;s attention.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very much like Kondou. I wouldn&rsquo;t have imagined he would use a traitor for his own gain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like it? Well, Tatsuya&rsquo;s plan is certainly not humane. But its reasonableness is unquestionable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd nodded vaguely to Rudra as he spoke. It didn&rsquo;t matter to Velgrynd how outrageous the plan was. She just wanted to bring down heaven&rsquo;s punishment with her own hands. Velgrynd loved Rudra, but that did not mean that she loved humans. She did not hate them, and she did not want to destroy them, but she just could not forgive the fools who betrayed Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Well, fine. If it helps Rudra, I&rsquo;ll let it slide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satisfied, Velgrynd urged the conversation to go on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what is Kondou&rsquo;s plan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get to that later, but first, we need to review our current strategy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Velgrynd immediately understood Rudra&rsquo;s intentions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yeah. Now that we are in this situation, there is no point in having a two-sided strategy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Let&rsquo;s withdraw the operation and put off the attack on Luminas until later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Once you and I convince Veldora, we can take care of the rest. I&rsquo;ll call Gladium and the others back so they won&rsquo;t get in the way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can you do that for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, of course. Let&rsquo;s continue to crush the rebels and take Dwargon as well. That way we can deceive Guy&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that conversation, the strategy planning between the two ended. Velgrynd rose to her feet. It was the first time in thousands of years that she had made a serious move. And so, the curtain rose on what would become known as &lsquo;The Purge of the Red Lotus&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.tyjcwt"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image16.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c19" id="h.klcm69491bic"><span class="c10">Chapter 3</span></h2><p class="c35"><span class="c20 c14">Capital in Turmoil</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">The darkness of the Imperial City ran deep. Thanks to the benefits of scientific civilization, the streets of the Imperial City were now illuminated by streetlights that used natural gas. Even so, there still existed backstreets that were hidden from the public eye. Although the Imperial City continued to develop, it would be a long time before all the darkness was exterminated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha was quietly walking in the darkness of the capital. This darkness was the place where Misha had been born and raised. Rather than fear, she felt a sense of comfort and calmness. This was the woman named Misha. In the days since she reported to Yuuki, Misha has been busy preparing for the coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat while hiding in plain sight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Currently, the Imperial Army was on an expedition. It was dangerous for Misha to go out in such a situation. If she was regarded as a fugitive from the enemy, she would be executed, and in fact, it would not be wrong to do so. Misha, however, was a dignified person, and there was no trace of fear on her face. Misha&rsquo;s confidence in her knowledge of the dark side of the capital was evident in her demeanor. In the first place, Misha was often involved in behind-the-scenes work, but she was also an excellent fighter. Although she was not as good as Vega and Damrada, Misha was also a good leader.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">She was a master of intelligence gathering, and she was proud of being superior to the dark side of Dwargon and the intelligence agents of Blumund. Therefore, Misha believed that she could hide from the Imperial Intelligence Agency. In fact, she had survived in the Imperial capital until now. Misha was heading to her destination as usual.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">But she seemed to have made a mistake. Although Misha had not been careless, a man appeared to block her way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His name was Tatsuya Kondou. He belonged to the Imperial Intelligence Agency, and was called &lsquo;the monster who ate up information&rsquo;. Although Damrada did not disclose this man&rsquo;s name, it was assumed that he was the leader of the Imperial Guardians. At the very least, Misha was sure that he was an opponent that she could never win against.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where do you think you&rsquo;re going at this time of night?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou&rsquo;s cold voice echoed. Misha smiled in reply, though she inwardly clicked her tongue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t this Lieutenant Kondou? Are you working late at night, Lieutenant Kondou?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the surface, Misha made a counterattack without hesitation, but on the inside, the situation was undoubtedly the worst.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">He is definitely a monster to have sniffed me out in such a remote place in this spacious capital. I don&rsquo;t think I can win in a fight, and the guards won&rsquo;t be able to buy much time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou suddenly appeared in front of her, but it seemed that he was acting alone. Misha was not optimistic about the situation and tried to find a way to escape from the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are Misha, the Chief of Staff to the Commander of the Calgurio Corps, right? Why are you back in the capital during the war operation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou asked Misha in a very serious tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was scared, Lieutenant Kondou! Actually, I have received a secret order from Calgurio to return to the capital.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha replied, thinking that she could fool him anyway. At the same time, she searched for any signs around her surroundings without any caution. There was no one in the narrow alley. That was fine, but the problem was that the guards had disappeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">He&rsquo;s already taken care of them? How much of a difference in ability is there that I didn&rsquo;t even notice any signs of battle?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a split second, Misha grasped the situation. Although She and Kondou had not met in person until now, there was no way that he did not know about Misha. It would be difficult to get through this situation with words, though it was still unclear as to how he saw her. Now that the guards had been taken out without question, she should assume that there would be no room for deception. Misha decided to ask for help from Damrada, whom she was scheduled to meet. But then, a bad thought came to her mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">How did they know where I was? Yuuki-sama has decided to trust Damrada, but can I really trust him?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Damrada who had designated the meeting place, and today&rsquo;s discussion was to inform the group of the secret meeting with Demon Lord Rimuru scheduled for tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Oh, this is not good. A possibility of Damrada&rsquo;s betrayal&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t think so. I am also indebted to Damrada, not to mention Yuuki-sama&rsquo;s judgment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha and Damrada had known each other for over twenty years. As the leaders of the secret society Cerberus, she knew more about Damrada than Yuuki did. This was the reason why Misha was so confused. Damrada was a rational man with a cool-headed side. Judging from the information he had given, there seemed to be no reason for him to betray Misha and the others. Not only did Misha want to believe this, but she was convinced by Yuuki&rsquo;s explanation. If this was the case, now was not the time to hesitate, but to trust in her companions to the end. Misha settled her mind and looked at Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thank the great Majesty Rudra for the good fortune of meeting you here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lieutenant, right? The one who disposed of my pursuers. I thought it would be tough to take on that many men by myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, so that&rsquo;s how you want to play this out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, am I being suspected, by any chance? I have come back from that hell to deliver the information I have obtained.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha continued to perform with aplomb. She flirtatiously walked up to Kondou and leaned against his chest. She would use her charm as a &lsquo;Lover&rsquo; to her fullest to seduce the man. This was Misha&rsquo;s specialty. She used &lsquo;Curse perfume&rsquo; and &lsquo;Charm&rsquo; to influence the target&rsquo;s thoughts. The idea was to make the target captivated by Misha by stimulating their instincts and inhibiting their ability to think. The deeper the mind and body were in contact with each other, the more dependent the subject became with Misha. Once this happened, it would be as if they had been dominated by their partner, just as she had planned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had been negotiating with Calgurio, and had almost completed her captivation with him after having made him near her several times. Not just Calgurio, but many other men had fallen for Misha&rsquo;s tricks. For Misha, who had never failed in her career, this was the strongest trump card she could play. Even if the opponent was superior in strength, they would fall before her in the face of carnal desire. Misha was convinced of this and put her supple hands on Kondou&rsquo;s back. She pressed her ample breasts against Kondou and flaunted her charms. Then, she looked for his reaction. Suddenly, she could feel Kondou&rsquo;s attention relax. Misha giggled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Fufu, thank goodness. He may look serious, but Kondou is still a man after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The response was more positive than she had expected, and she figured she could make it work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s go someplace better, okay? Perhaps someplace more private than this&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She put her lips close to Kondou&rsquo;s ear and whispered softly. As if in response, Kondou&rsquo;s right hand moved, and a murmur of &lsquo;Okay&rsquo; reached Misha&rsquo;s ear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">It looks like this is going to work. The best thing to do is to meet up with Damrada at the destination. If that&rsquo;s not possible, then I can find a way to take Kondou, and then we&rsquo;ll be together again&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was Misha&rsquo;s last thought. There was a dry thud. Misha crumpled to the ground. Bright red blood flowed from the left side of her head as it bled into the ground. In Kondou&rsquo;s hand was Nambu automatic pistol that he had drawn out without being detected. The smoke rising from the muzzle of the gun asserted itself as the weapon that had shot Misha in the temple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou did not change his expression and put the gun away as if nothing had happened. The information had already been collected. With his Unique Skill &lsquo;Decipherer&rsquo;, he could read the thoughts and feelings of the target he is in contact with. Misha&rsquo;s purpose, Yuuki&rsquo;s plan, and even the fate of the Imperial Army that went on the expedition. It took less than a second for him to decipher all of this information. And even though he had read such important information, there was still no change in his expression. He merely looked bored as he spoke in the darkness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;A coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat? Foolish. Are you still going to do this and claim that you haven&rsquo;t betrayed His Majesty?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the darkness that should have gone unanswered, a man emerged. He did not answer Kondou&rsquo;s question, but instead walked up to the fallen Misha. It was Damrada.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kondou, you didn&rsquo;t have to kill her, did you? This person, too, could have been of use to you if you had trained her properly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, there was no chance of that. This woman would have been about thirty-seventh in the pecking order, at best. If she were within the tenth rank, she would still have had a chance, but she wouldn&rsquo;t have been of any use to His Majesty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I went to all the trouble of leaving myself defenseless, and she couldn&rsquo;t even get past my defenses,&rdquo; Kondou said coldly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada heard this and shrugged his shoulders. If Kondou said so, then it must be so, and he agreed without any further rebuttal. He only had mixed feelings about Misha, who had been his companion. Damrada knelt down next to Misha and held his hand to the left side of the body. A soft light sealed the wound. He pushed back Misha&rsquo;s protruding eyeballs and closed her eyelids. Finally, he wiped the dirt from her face, trying to restore some of her beauty. Damrada could not bring the dead back to life, but he at least wanted to let her rest in peace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a waste of time. If we leave her alone, the body will be disposed of before the night is out. Instead, answer my question.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not like you. I can&rsquo;t separate myself from these things as easily as you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How naive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s weird. At your young age, how can you be so thorough in suppressing your emotions?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have no feelings. That&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stupid&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen hell. His Majesty Rudra saved me from that hell. If you are planning to be his enemy, I will not tolerate it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am His Majesty&rsquo;s loyal servant. I would never betray him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to say. Remember, you&rsquo;ve also fallen in my hands. If you want me to trust you, then prove it with your actions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, Kondou left without looking back. Damrada also took one look at Misha&rsquo;s corpse before leaving. The night was long in the capital. There was still work to be done.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha&rsquo;s body was disposed of by the men in the Intelligence Bureau without leaving any traces. The darkness of the night was deep in the capital, and the whole event was buried as if it had never happened.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

In order to execute a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat, careful preparation was essential. A message was sent out that day, and within a few days, the leading figures from all over the world were assembled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nearly 30 executives crowded into Yuuki&rsquo;s mansion in the capital. The people they had summoned this time were those who had sworn absolute loyalty to Yuuki. Since some of them, such as Vega, were undercover in other corps and could not participate in the meeting, around half of them were present.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The plan for the coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat itself had been in the making for quite some time. The participants in the meeting waited for Yuuki&rsquo;s words with a feeling that the time had finally come. All of them were very capable people. They were all making a name for themselves in the military, relying on their own strength. Their loyalty to Emperor Rudra did not exist from the beginning. Some of them were even excited to bring about a revolution in this country. Visitors from another world. Interracial species who had mixed blood with other races. Experimental subjects who had been repeatedly subjected to atrocious experiments in the pursuit of strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki had trained them to be first-rate adventurers. There were also slave warriors collected by Damrada, and majin protected by Misha. They believed in violence and strength. This was the belief system of the Mixed Corps.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up a staircase in a large atrium floor, there was a large room designed for meetings. Yuuki made his entrance n with Kagali just as everyone sat down on chairs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, guys. Thank you for coming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In his usual cheerful tone, Yuuki greeted them with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A meeting with Demon Lord Rimuru is scheduled for tomorrow. I have sent Misha to call Damrada, so we will discuss the details when Damrada arrives.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing this statement, the audience was in an uproar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t doing this on our own?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Demon Lord Rimuru is cunning and tricky. Can we trust him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, wait. That said, we are still at war, aren&rsquo;t we? Demon Lord Rimuru is a faction of the war, so there&rsquo;s no way he could take the time to come here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The voices were heard from various places in the hall. Yuuki&rsquo;s smile deepened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Imperial Army has been destroyed. It&rsquo;s said that Rimuru-san killed all the 940,000 Imperial troops that invaded the city.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too quick. Based on the travel time, it must have been only a few days since they made contact with the enemy&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The audience was in an uproar at the unbelievable story. Yuuki laughed and gestured for everyone to be quiet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To overthrow an Empire, combat power is necessary. That is why I decided to join forces with Rimuru-san.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, some of them begin to understand Yuuki&rsquo;s statement, even if they did not agree with it. Shrewdly, they began to shift their attention towards whether the information was reliable or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Was this information brought back by Misha-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were people in the audience who belonged to Cerberus and knew that Misha had served in the military. That is why they asked the question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I think Misha would have been killed too if we had not been allies beforehand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Misha-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize it was that bad&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha was often behind the scenes, but she was well known. The name of Cerberus was not just for looks. Because only meritocrats are present here, they gave due credit to their colleagues. In a strange sense, they had a lot of trust in Yuuki because they did not value those who could not meet their expectations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. In that case, I am in favor of the alliance. Although I am not happy about the concealment thus far, I&rsquo;m sure the boss had his own reasons for keeping quiet about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much a theory. It&rsquo;s just that Guy beat me to it and forced me to make a promise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Guy? Don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s Guy Crimson?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you fight the Lord of Darkness? Boss, you are too reckless!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way. I&rsquo;m surprised you survived.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The audience was in an uproar in a different sense, but Yuuki silenced them once again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know you have a lot to say, but I don&rsquo;t have time to explain it. I&rsquo;d rather discuss the arrangements for tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting and how to proceed with the operation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only official forces remaining in the capital were the Intelligence Bureau and the New Legion. Although the top-level officials of the Intelligence Bureau might be a threat, the lowest-level officials need not be counted in the strength of the forces. The New Legion, though numbering as many as 100,000 men, was too weak to be a threat. They were not troublesome in terms of strength, but merely troublesome due to their numbers. There were about 20,000 other guards stationed in the city in place of the police, but they were no match for the military in terms of equipment. The difference in strength between the military and the police was so great that it was akin to making adults deal with children. At best, they could only serve to stall for time. However, the Emperor still had the strongest force in his hand, the Imperial Guardians.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Intelligence Bureau also has a royal guard in its midst. So, strictly speaking, it is only the near guard that we should really be wary of.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. They&rsquo;ve been hit with a few rank battles, but the top ones are really strong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, come on, you&rsquo;re just boasting. There are also traitors like you amongst the royal guard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I guess so. I believe only in power, and I have no allegiance to the Emperor who only shows himself off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was where the laughter came in. Three were people of their own among the Imperial Guard. By reaffirming this fact, they realized how much of an advantage they were in. The man who started this trend was a little small but with an arrogant attitude. His name was Arios. Although he was an otherworlder, he was not a summoner, but a wanderer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, will Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s reinforcements be ready by tomorrow?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A dark-haired girl asked Yuuki a question. Mai Furuki&mdash;She was also an otherworlder. She was a Japanese high school girl who had been summoned to this world. Mai had been picked up by Yuuki, who was the grandmaster, and he had helped her in various ways. Because of this, she trusted and admired Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. If they&rsquo;re coming with an army, it&rsquo;s going to take them a long time no matter how fast they go. If they&rsquo;re flying, they won&rsquo;t actually come then, will they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if to cover Mai&rsquo;s question, a large muscular man spoke up. His name was Torneot, who was once a slave fighter. If Damrada had not found him, he would have been a slave in the mines to this day. Torneot had been thrown into the army, educated, and soon discovered the joy of learning. That is why he was apparently well-informed and held the position as a general staff officer in the Mixed Corps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Flight magic is extremely psychologically draining. It may be okay for demon lords, but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that even the other monsters can do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agreeing with Torneot was a small girl. Her name was Aria, a wizard and a heavy warrior. Her appearance did not match her age, and she was a unique person who had undergone remodeling surgery on herself while she was an apprentice of Master Gadra. Torneot replied to Aria with disgust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not just that. There&rsquo;s a surveillance net over the capital too. If they come in from the sky, they&rsquo;ll be noticed even if they land far away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aria&rsquo;s face turned red and she felt ashamed of herself when she was told a surprisingly accurate point. Aria was unusually short-tempered and thoughtless for a wizard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, all right, it&rsquo;s important to have different opinions. Analyzing things from different angles helps us to see things from various perspectives.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki quickly interceded and pulled the agenda back on track.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-san has contacted me through old man Gadra and said that only a few people are coming tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The contact with Rimuru was made through &lsquo;Magic Communication&rsquo;, which Gadra kept secret. Even if the Imperial Intelligence Bureau had intercepted the message, it would have been impossible to decipher it because it was encrypted. Gadra only communicated the gist of the message, but he had not yet decided who would go to the meeting. If Rimuru was confirmed, who would be the escort?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">It seems that Rimuru-san has decided that there is no point in making a demonstration against Rudra. They are going to ensure quality rather than quantity, and I am sure that only the executives will come to Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki estimated that there would be at most about ten people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&hellip;is that them underestimating the Empire? Or are they mocking us as allies?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A slender and beautiful woman, twisting her body gracefully, tilted her head and asked a question. It was not so much a question rather than an expression of her thoughts. The seemingly natural-looking woman was a warrior named Orca. In contrast to her appearance, she was an extraordinary person with a number of hidden skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Orca, that&rsquo;s not true. As I said before, a large army takes time to prepare, and everything takes time. I think they decided it was better to go with a small elite force.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once again, Torneot provided an explanation. Yuuki smiled at him as if he had just saved him a lot of trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s why we need to set up our own plans.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Rimuru would arrive with only the best of the best</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">the question was, who would deal with whom?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We will hear what Rimuru-san thinks at tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting. That&rsquo;s why we need to put our thoughts together. For example, what to do about Emperor Rudra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki&rsquo;s statement could be seen as arrogant. He was looking only to a future where he was the winner, not to a future where he had lost. It was unusual for him to be discussing the treatment of the Emperor before the coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat had even started. However, no one pointed this out. Even Torneot, who has the tendency to poke and prod, smiled and was ready to wait for Yuuki to speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Dwarven Kingdom is aware of the situation. That&rsquo;s why the Mixed Corps forces that are currently deployed can also launch themselves toward the capital without worrying about their own backs. If only the forces remaining are in the capital, it should be a piece of cake, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, indeed. So the only threat is the Imperial Guard?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki responded with a smile. In truth, he knew that the real threat lied elsewhere. There was an unknown entity known as the Marshal. And if one considered the meaning of Guy&rsquo;s decision to let Yuuki live&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Why did Rimuru-san move this time? He is normally a pacifist who hates to initiate attacks on other countries&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps it was to avoid any regrets, however, he could not help thinking that this was not the only reason. Yuuki then put the pieces together one by one. Then, he imagined the shadow of Guy appearing behind Rimuru. If that was the case, he could only come to the conclusion that there was a monster in the Empire who could be Guy&rsquo;s opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Depending on the circumstances, it is inevitable to kill the Emperor, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting ahead of yourself, Arios.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s not good to take all the credit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those gathered were excited, and some of them even began to talk about the Emperor&rsquo;s murder, or the murder of his people. Yuuki thought that it was too early to talk about the Emperor&rsquo;s fate, but he reminded himself that it was a good thing to be so full of vigor. In fact, the treatment of Emperor Rudra would be discussed in tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting. Gadra was against killing him, and Damrada&rsquo;s loyalty was to Emperor Rudra. Since these two men were important collaborators, Yuuki did not want to make a bad impression on them. Before that, there was a high possibility that Emperor Rudra was the one whom Guy was worried about. If so, it would be suicidal to make a move against him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Let&rsquo;s just wait and see. There&rsquo;s no need to take the risk of picking up chestnuts from the fire. I&rsquo;ll just hand the Emperor over to Rimuru-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki made his conclusion. The details of the meeting would be discussed after Damrada&rsquo;s arrival, but they now had a rough outline. The main body of the Mixed Corps would take control of the Imperial City. The Imperial Guard, who would be in the way, would be taken care of by those present here. The men Yuuki had selected here were as good as any Imperial Knight in terms of ability. Although they were not as good as the elites, they had an advantage in numbers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If several players were to challenge one person, it was possible to overturn such a gap in strength. The opponents of monsters such as Rudra and &lsquo;Marshal&rsquo; could be left to Rimuru, who had taken the trouble to participate in the battle. Since Rimuru was probably planning to do so anyway, this proposal was expected to be accepted. No reinforcements would come from anywhere to defend the capital.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of the three major corps, the Armored Corps was destroyed by Rimuru. The Magic Beast Corps was far in the sky. Even if they rushed to the defense as soon as they knew the situation, all the battles would have been settled by then. The last of the legions, the Mixed Corps, had defected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that the plan had been advanced to this point, they were in a position to win the game. The victory was close at hand with no need to rush. However, Yuuki could not shake off the uneasy feeling that he had overlooked something. What was it that he was missing&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you for your patience.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A calm voice echoed in the heated hall. Upon hearing his voice, everyone shrank back as if they had been doused with cold water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At last, Damrada.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">The man</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">Damrada</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">had arrived at the venue.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

At that point, Yuuki felt uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What happened to Misha?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She died.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hall fell silent. Everyone felt a sense of disquiet and was on the verge of war. Those of them who were there had been through a number of such situations, so they were sensitive to such signs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean, Damrada?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like I said. Misha was killed by Kondou.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing this, Yuuki felt the lingering lump in his chest disappear. He had felt uneasy, as if he had overlooked something. And now he realized that he had finally found out what it was. The relationship between Yuuki and Damrada, though not long, was very deep. They had shared a countless number of wrongdoings that could not be revealed to the public. It was with Damrada&rsquo;s help that Yuuki had been able to destroy Echidna, which had controlled the underworld of the Empire. After that, he had established the secret society Cerberus and kept working for it as its leader.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki had thought so, but it seems that he had been mistaken. Everything had gone as the Empire wanted it to go. The secret society Cerberus was an organization led by the people Damrada had gathered. Its purpose was to sort out the talented from the incompetent. They had been searching for the best and the brightest by spreading information networks all over the world. Protecting strays was a part of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was not a recent development. It had been happening for a long time, ever since the days when Echidna had been on the rampage. In this way, it was possible that Yuuki himself must have been one of those very people who were discovered by Damrada. They found the strong and brought them onto their side. It was Yuuki who had caught the eye of Damrada, who had been moving along with such a goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada himself would be too conspicuous if he appeared in the public. Yuuki was chosen to be nothing more than a stand-in. In other words, he had been used by the people who he thought he was using. That being said, this did not mean that Damrada had betrayed them. Damrada&rsquo;s loyalty was genuine. Someone was manipulating Damrada to make him trust the naturally suspicious Yuuki, and this answered the doubts that he had been feeling. Realizing this, Yuuki let out a sigh of disappointment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been fooled. Since when was it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;? What are you talking about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada replied in an indifferent manner. It was the same tone of voice as usual, but it made Yuuki feel that something was definitely off. He was not pretending to be confused, but rather was sincerely unable to understand what was being said. This meant that Damrada himself was unaware that he was being manipulated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">No wonder I didn&rsquo;t realize it. If he was unaware of it, there is no way I could detect it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thinking this way, Yuuki recalled the last time they had talked. At that time, Damrada insisted that he had not betrayed them. He felt that he was sincere, and in fact, it was possible that he might have done something after that. If Yuuki believed his intuition, it felt to him that Damrada had only been manipulated recently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">That&rsquo;s right. I am the one who decided to believe in Damrada. I&rsquo;m not going to say much about that at this point, but the important thing is the purpose of whoever sent Damrada here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was someone controlling Damrada. This was a definite fact in Yuuki&rsquo;s mind, and if he took that into consideration, he could guess that their current situation was very severe. The siege against Yuuki and his group would be completed even as they were dealing with Damrada. Yuuki became lost in his thoughts. Beside him, Kagali was quietly analyzing the situation. However, the energetic young people in the hall were agitated by Damrada&rsquo;s attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damrada, you are being disrespectful to Yuuki-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aria condemned him. Torneot then asked him what was going on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damrada-san, what are you thinking? Are you planning to betray us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Betrayal? That&rsquo;s a curious thing to say,&rdquo; he replied aloofly. &ldquo;My allegiance is unwavering and dedicated to His Majesty Emperor Rudra from beginning to the end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Che, that&rsquo;s called betrayal!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arios spat out fiercely Damrada was famous for being dirty with money and was looked down upon by some of his friends. Because Damrada was such a person, many of them were more angry than surprised at this situation. The first to make a move was Torneot. He grabbed Damrada by the neck with one hand and spoke threateningly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so damn coy! You got me. You were the one who said I should live for the cause rather than die a slave in the mines. I was grateful to you. So why are you doing this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Torneot&rsquo;s actions were actually to protect Damrada. He was trying to find a way to get out of this situation before others made a move. However, for Damrada, this seemed to have been an afterthought. Damrada gently squeezed Torneot&rsquo;s wrist back, manipulated the flow of force, and in turn restrained him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Torneot, do you remember what I said?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada&rsquo;s eyes were so cold that they chilled the calm Torneot to the core.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wh-what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Torneot answered while holding his wrist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I teach you back then to be strong for the cause? Is this all you&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Torneot&rsquo;s wrist crunched as all the forces converged on a single point. And just like that</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">it shattered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, my wrist, in an instant&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Groaning and rubbing his wrist, Torneot moved away from Damrada. He took out a restorative he had on hand and healed himself. Damrada stood calmly, not bothering to attack Torneot. He was not letting his guard down in the slightest. In this world where some monsters could heal a broken bone in an instant, one must not let their guard down until they have neutralized their opponents. Without such an awareness, one could not survive in this world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as he watched Damrada. He knew Damrada was strong. Since he was in the top of the Single Digits, it was no wonder that he was stronger than the others gathered in this room. The important thing was whether or not he had an Ultimate Skill. And, also, to what extent he was being manipulated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">In the end, the real question is whether my &lsquo;Anti-Skill&rsquo; will be able to disarm it or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Depending on that, Damrada would have to be killed. Yuuki deliberately did not stop his companions in order to find out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you were just the Emperor&rsquo;s dog. I had thought you were just a money-grubber, but I was fooled. Even so, to come in here and expose yourself all on your own, it was a foolish act&hellip;unlike your usual cowardice!&rdquo; Arios shouted, and that was the start of the situation changing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Damrada-san. I have been in your debt, so I&rsquo;m going to kill you myself in a way you won&rsquo;t have to suffer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Torneot, now in full swing, challenged Damrada with all his might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Too slow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Torneot swung his mace with both hands, but Damrada dove past the mace with ease. With a natural movement, he drilled into Torneot&rsquo;s chest, gently pushing out his left palm. A heavy impact hit Torneot, not indicative of the lightness of his movements.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="DAMRADA GIVES EMERGENCY CPR" src="images/image19.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c14">Spiral penetration break</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">a technique that forces one&rsquo;s fighting aura into the opponent&rsquo;s body. The fighting aura penetrated through armor and muscles and destroyed the target from the inside. Its power was proportional to the amount of fighting energy, and Damrada&rsquo;s spiral penetrating attack would be a killing blow that could surpass the power of a tank gun. Torneot could not withstand it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Goof!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He vomited blood and cried out, cowering in place. He tried to stand up, but his legs were weak. Of course they were. Torneot&rsquo;s internal organs had been destroyed by the blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-I didn&rsquo;t know&hellip;you were this strong&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, well, well. To judge a man by his looks is the haughty pride and arrogance of the strong. Perhaps, because I hired you as my bodyguard, you mistakenly thought that you were stronger than me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you to be strong and not look down on people. Even if one does not rely on a Skill, they can still get stronger with training. Just like me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as he said this, Damrada shot backward with a spinning back kick without looking back. The assailant who had aimed at Damrada from behind was unable to react to the kick, and was killed instantly with his neck broken. He was killed too easily, but it was still Arios who had been one of the strongest people whom Yuuki had recognized.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arios had the Unique Skill &lsquo;Murderer&rsquo;, and also possessed the &lsquo;Silent Movement&rsquo; and &lsquo;Presence Concealment&rsquo; abilities&mdash;all traits that made him suitable for assassination missions. It was a skill structure that specialized in killing, and he had been a man worthy of the forty-fourth rank. It was expected to be a battle favorable to Arios, but Damrada had easily buried him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is not enough to rely on Skills. The only thing you can rely on in a critical moment is your own body and spirit that you have trained. In my opinion, you are useless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada&rsquo;s words were harsh. Those who had never been mocked even by their instructors in the art of war were outraged to hear them. They were furious at Damrada&rsquo;s words, which sounded like a warning to the weak. All of them became fretful and unleashed their murderous intent on Damrada. Under such circumstances, Yuuki was calmly analyzing the situation. He came to a conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">I knew it. Damrada did not betray us. He&rsquo;s being manipulated by someone. Arios was an Imperial Guard, so he may have been on the Emperor&rsquo;s side. The fact that he did not kill Torneot and didn&rsquo;t go easy on Arios is evidence of that. In other words, he still has some of his free will, but he can&rsquo;t do anything that is detrimental to his ruler, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It must be a very powerful controlling force that was manipulating Damrada. Yet Damrada was trying to get through to Yuuki somehow. Yuuki followed his judgment and came up with the optimal solution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, everyone pay attention! Right now, let&rsquo;s move to the retreat! I give full authority to Kagali, and you will join up with the Mixed Corps as fast as you can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Boss? We don&rsquo;t have to run away. We&rsquo;ll deal with the traitor, and then we&rsquo;ll go right back up&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki rejected Aria&rsquo;s proposal in a single word. He smiled with a comfortable expression as usual, but his eyes looked around all of them seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damrada is just trying to buy time. That is why he&rsquo;s explaining at length, because that is what&rsquo;s still allowed, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Allowed&rsquo;, you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali asked. Nodding his head, Yuuki answered definitively.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Damrada is not betraying us. He&rsquo;s being manipulated. And then he&rsquo;s going to exterminate us right here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reactions to Yuuki&rsquo;s words were varied, but they seemed to have the effect of restoring calm judgment to his fellow workers. They suppressed their killing intent toward Damrada and focused their attention on his second-in-command, Kagali. Kagali&rsquo;s judgment was similar to that of Yuuki&rsquo;s. Her instincts were ringing alarm bells, and Kagali knew that she was in a critical situation. When Yuuki gave her the instructions, Kagali understood what she had to do. The situation was urgent. Kagali, who had no time to argue with Yuuki&rsquo;s instructions, took action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re abandoning this site and heading for the Mixed Corps encampment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But what about Yuuki-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I don&rsquo;t think Damrada will let me go, so I have to deal with him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So go,&rdquo; Yuuki said, turning his back on everyone and confronting Damrada.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;Understood!&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone knew what they had to do. Whether Damrada was a traitor or not did not matter anymore. Just by watching Yuuki&rsquo;s back, they came to an understanding. They, who were strong, understood that what they needed to do now was not to argue with each other, but to try their best to survive. Aria carried the fallen Torneot. While it was funny to see a small girl carrying a big man on her back, no one laughed at her. The wielder of the healing spell healed Torneot and joined the back of the group. And then, in an orderly fashion, they departed into the darkness of the night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few minutes later. Yuuki and Damrada were the only ones left in the large conference room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if you run now, it will be too late. You were always too late. Yuuki-sama underestimated the intelligence bureau.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe. But if you persist, you might be able to find a way out of it, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ridiculous. This is not child&rsquo;s play.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;m always serious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Along with your dream of world domination?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course! And you&rsquo;re the same way too, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Damrada laughed as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; he said with deep satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki Kagurazaka was a good master to Damrada. He had a cool-headed side to him, even though his thoughts were still childish at times. He was very calculating and never bored Damrada. That is why Damrada trusted Yuuki. He thought that Yuuki would realize that he was being manipulated by Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada&rsquo;s loyalty to Emperor Rudra was real. He admitted this to Yuuki, but it was nothing to Rudra. In the first place, the two were not even comparable. Emperor Rudra was everything to Damrada. And Damrada was acting in accordance with his promise to Rudra. Fulfilling that promise was the purpose of Damrada&rsquo;s life. Damrada had known Rudra longer than Kondou. Therefore, it was undeniable that Kondou would also be careless enough not to touch Damrada.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was aware of his suspiciousness, and therefore he was cautious, but Kondou seemed to be a more dangerous man than Damrada had thought. Soon after he said farewell to Misha, Damrada&rsquo;s will was put under Kondou&rsquo;s control. The method was unknown, but Damrada was unable to break it by any means. Damrada&rsquo;s consciousness remained intact, but Kondou had taken control of all his actions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Kondou, I never thought you could manipulate me as well. That guy is very cautious, but I didn&rsquo;t think he would go this far. Even so, as expected of Yuuki-sama.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since he could not disarm this by his own strength, the only hope left was to rely on Yuuki. This meant that Damrada needed to make him aware of the situation, which was a very difficult task. It was very difficult for Yuuki to be made aware of Damrada&rsquo;s situation because he seemed to be betraying them by all intents and purposes. Damrada himself had been about to give up, thinking that it would be impossible to make people believe in him. However, Yuuki recognized it beautifully. Damrada was moved by this fact and said only what Kondou allowed him to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yuuki-sama, as Deputy Commander of the Imperial Guardians, I will show you what the second rank in the pecking order is all about!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This rule was by permission only, and restrictions were placed on Damrada&rsquo;s actions. Despite this situation, Damrada attempted to pass on as much information as possible to Yuuki. One of them was to give him his title. If Yuuki knew all the information that could be given to him, he would be able to make use of it as he liked. Damrada was convinced of this and intended to leave the rest to Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">All that is left is for Yuuki-sama to kill me. Yuuki-sama will fulfill the promise to His Majesty Rudra. It is a pity that I cannot see it with my own eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada was sure that Yuuki would succeed in inheriting his will, because in order for Yuuki to fulfill his ambition, he had to fulfill Damrada&rsquo;s will as well. Damrada did not hold out on expectations that were too high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. There&rsquo;s still a lot of work to be done. I will help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah! Saying such naive things won&rsquo;t help you defeat me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The joyful feelings that welled from his heart could not be extinguished, even if he was being manipulated. Damrada unleashed his emotions to his heart&rsquo;s content&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Under Yuuki&rsquo;s orders, Kagali and the others attempted to escape from the capital at night to meet up with the Mixed Corps. The location where the Mixed Corps was encamped was near the border of the Dwarven Kingdom. It was about 500 kilometers to the southwest of the capital, a distance that would take a peddler more than ten days to travel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A person with high mana could use the &lsquo;portals&rsquo; that stretched around the capital. It was the result of a superior magical technology that enabled them to travel between the cities in an instant. However, it was not something that could be used by a hundred people at once, and since it was an important facility, it was heavily guarded. It was obvious that barging in at this late hour of the night would lead to a fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali, without any hesitation, chose to go on her own. She decided that the first priority was to prepare her forces, rather than to start a dispute here. In this group, everyone was a superhuman beyond the level of normal human beings. If they keep running without a break, they could reach the destination in a few hours.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is Kagali-sama okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s no problem. Thanks for your concern, Teare.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali thanked Teare, the masked girl running beside her. Kagali was an ex-demon lord who wandered around in a spiritual body for decades after being defeated by Demon Lord Leon. At that time, Kagali&mdash;Demon Lord Kazalim, who was not a spiritual body, had to do his best just to maintain his own ego. Overcoming such a past, he finally got a homunculus body thanks to Yuuki. And without any problem, he had been training it powerfully. So now, he had acquired the fighting ability comparable to that of a greater majin. Even in the midst of this group of strong men, she was not lagging.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah? Well, that&rsquo;s good. I just wish Laplace was here at this point&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Laplace could have won against Damrada.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hohoho. The boss is strong too. He will surely come back to us with a victory!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali smiled as she answered, but she was also aware of the growing impatience inside her. The alarm bells had been ringing nonstop since a few minutes ago, and Kagali&rsquo;s anxiety was getting bigger and bigger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">&mdash;Not good. This is not good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was an instinctive intuition, but she didn&rsquo;t know how many times it had saved her life. Therefore, Kagali knew that something had to be done, even if there was no evidence to support it. She turned her attention to Teare and Footman, the people she trusted the most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Call Laplace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tell him to come back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Teare and Footman could communicate with Laplace by &lsquo;telepathy&rsquo;. No matter how far apart they were, the clowns were connected to each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Laplace is on his way as the messenger&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. Hurry up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The alarm bells that only Kagali could hear were getting louder. There was no time for explanations. Judging that there was no time to explain, Kagali left Teare alone and tried to give her next order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everybody, spread out from here! Use your own judgment and put survival first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was not able to say a word until the end, telling them to join the Mixed Corps. She realized that it was already too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;That&rsquo;s amazing. I thought I had completely covered my tracks, but I&rsquo;m surprised you noticed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With these words, a man in military uniform emerged from the darkness. It was Lieutenant Kondou. Not just Kondou, but also others descended soundlessly from the roofs of the buildings facing the main street, one after another. There were about fifty of them. However, they could feel an overwhelming presence from each and every one of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Imperial Guardians&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Stop your futile resistance and surrender. Then you will have the honor of dying for the Emperor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll admit it. Lieutenant Kondou, you are the Commander of the Imperial Guardians.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou kept his expression blank even after being pointed out. He neither denied nor confirmed it, but that was enough for Kagali. Kagali and the others were crowded near the knights who stood in a circle around them. Now that the situation had come to this, a battle was inevitable. The Imperial Knights were fully armed with legendary-grade weapons. Even though they were equal in strength, there was a big difference in equipment. Although they were at a huge disadvantage, none of Yuuki&rsquo;s subordinates would give up at this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah, let&rsquo;s do this! It&rsquo;ll save us a lot of trouble!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Let&rsquo;s see what the Imperial Guardians can do!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Torneot, who had almost died a few minutes earlier, threw up a flare, and Aria took advantage of it to make a big show. As if she had supernatural power, she had no intention of admitting defeat without doing anything. Kagali was trying her best to analyze the situation. The probability of everyone&rsquo;s survival was close to zero. The tactical victory goal at this point was to have as many people join up with the Mixed Corps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to do so, they needed to stall for time. Until Yuuki defeated Damrada. Until Laplace came back to help. Buying precious time&mdash;this was Kagali&rsquo;s mission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Well, I hope one of you can make it, but we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With this in mind, Kagali stepped forward to Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? You&rsquo;re going to be my opponent?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Let&rsquo;s see how powerful the head of the Imperial Guard is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali replied, but she knew that she was not as good as Kondou. Kagali&rsquo;s goal was to use herself as a decoy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">If winning is impossible, then at best, we can buy time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With this determination, she took a stance towards Kondou. Kondou, on the other hand, seemed to have no interest in Kagali. He sighed in frustration at the battle that had begun around him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hate useless work. I&rsquo;m not going to play along with your stalling tactics, and you should understand that you can&rsquo;t win a war with mental will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you think? I was hoping that if I prayed, a miracle might happen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, ridiculous. An ex-demon lord talking in his sleep.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Kagali also gives a click of her tongue. Only a few of her friends were supposed to know about her original identity as an ex-demon lord. Kondou had revealed it so easily. In other words, he had judged that such information was a trivial matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re underestimating me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so. I&rsquo;ll tell you something else. You&rsquo;re trying to join up with the Mixed Corps, but it&rsquo;s no use. The Emperor himself has already organized a strike force.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was an unusual situation for the Emperor to go to war. But Kagali&rsquo;s concern was with the word &lsquo;strike force&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, only the strong matter. In the first place, whether or not people are loyal to His Majesty Rudra matters, because we have no need for small fry who have no chance to awaken.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What kind of&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand? You are alive today only because there remains the possibility of evolution. Everything is going according to His Majesty Rudra&rsquo;s plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What nonsense! Are you trying to say that our plans have all been seen through?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali was incensed. Kondou took one look at Kagali as if unamused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a foolish question. Did you really think you were deceiving my eyes here in the capital?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A faint flame of emotion lit up in Kagali&rsquo;s heart. The name of that emotion was humiliation. With the Unique Skill &lsquo;Schemer&rsquo;, Kagali had been making various plans and succeeding in them. Despite her continuous failures because of Rimuru, Kagali was proud of being Yuuki&rsquo;s schemer and his strategist. Kondou scoffed at her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How could a human&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You mean Yuuki Kagurazaka, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a blood-curdling rage washing over her, Kagali felt as if her eyes had gone blank. Even so, she also saw that this was part of Kondou&rsquo;s plan. If she let her emotions get the better of her in anger, she would lose a battle that could have been won. As proof of this, Footman, perhaps provoked by Kagali&rsquo;s anger, attacked Kondou as if he had lost all reason. Footman, who boasted the greatest offensive power among the clowns, was firing extremely large mana bullets without any concern about destroying the city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou dodged the attack, but an alarm sounded in the city, and it seemed as if a big commotion was about to break out. At this rate, not only Kondou&rsquo;s group but also other guards and onlookers would rush to the scene. Now that this had happened, there was no need for Kagali and the others to be concerned. They should regard anyone who disturbed them as an enemy and kick them out. However, she was sure that Kondou and the others were well aware of such a situation. In that case, why were they tolerating the current situation? That was Kagali&rsquo;s question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Settle down, and think calmly. He&rsquo;s just trying to make me angry&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since she knew what Kondou was planning to do, she would just have to go along with Kondou. Thinking of this, Kagali stifled her anger. She suddenly felt uneasy, as if she had overlooked something serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Wait&hellip;? Damrada was being manipulated by someone. If it was Kondou&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only Footman, but also Teare was taking part in the battle. Around them, the Imperial Guardians and Yuuki&rsquo;s companions were fighting each other to a terrible extent. Kondou did not change his stance even in such a situation. Before she knew it, Kondou was holding a pistol in his right hand and a sword in his left to deal with the situation. Footman and Teare, the two majin who were more powerful than demon lords, still maintained their composure.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="CIRCUS TIME" src="images/image24.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although she had expected him to be strong, this was more than expected. Without a doubt, he was stronger than Damrada. Kagali felt this way, and realized once again how scary Kondou was. Kondou only held up his gun and did not show any sign of shooting it. He was fighting Footman and Teare with only his sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sword was, in Kagali&rsquo;s eyes, a great sword. In fact, unbeknownst to Kagali, the sword was made in the style of a naval sword, but the blade was a beautiful work of art with a lovely blade pattern that fascinated any who saw it. It was a family heirloom that had been passed down in the Kondou family for generations, and was not a cheap item that an amateur would be able to own. Naturally, it was not a weapon to be handled with one hand. Nevertheless, Kondou handled it with only one hand, gripping the lower part of the handle with his left hand. This was an ordinary style, and it was obvious to onlookers that he had not been showing his true ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">This man is dangerous. Taking on those two as opponents, but not fighting seriously&hellip; So why? If he wanted to kill them, he could have taken them more seriously. If he isn&rsquo;t doing that, does he think we&rsquo;ll be of some use to him? I guess that&rsquo;s&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Kagali arrived at the answer. Kagali shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Watch out! Kondou may be able to manipulate others in some way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ho, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou did not deny it and instead admitted it honestly. Kagali thought this was strange.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">This man revealed his hand? No, there&rsquo;s no point in denying it, since we already suspect him. On the other hand, if he affirms it, it will make us more cautious, so I don&rsquo;t understand. Why did he...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali was skeptical. She could not understand Kondou&rsquo;s thoughts and could not see what the right thing to do was. Since she could not win by fighting, it would be best to follow the original strategy of stalling for time. That&rsquo;s what she thought, but she couldn&rsquo;t understand why Kondou was going along with this strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">&mdash;No, this is strange! How can this guy say he doesn&rsquo;t want to help us stall for time, but&mdash;Ah! Oh, that&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali finally realized how scary Kondou truly was. She realized that each conversation had a meaning, and that he had completely controlled the flow of the conversation by interweaving lies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re stalling for time as well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You finally figured it out? I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s been playing along with your stupid stalling games.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is easy to decipher what you think.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though she tried to keep her cool, Kondou&rsquo;s provocations irritated Kagali.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what to think&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you know why they call me &lsquo;the information monster&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You said it yourself earlier, didn&rsquo;t you? That I can control others. Then why didn&rsquo;t it occur to you that it would be easy for me to gain the knowledge of those I manipulate?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What is he talking about?&mdash;Kagali wondered. It would be too childish if this was a lie, but if this was true, it would be tantamount to divulging important secrets. It was hard to believe that this careful man would do such a thing as reveal his own hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a pain in the ass. It&rsquo;s not like I have all the answers myself. I was planning on making contact with you guys when I got out to the city. I&rsquo;m not happy about the damage to the capital, and it&rsquo;s a hassle to deal with you in this way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re holding back?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hohoho, we&rsquo;ve been underestimated!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In response to Kondou&rsquo;s words, Teare and Footman were enraged. It was just a trick of their opponents, and in this case, it was a bad move. Kagali was impatient because she understood this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calm down, you guys! Don&rsquo;t let his words disturb your emotions!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shouted and tried to stop their outburst. Kondou took one look at Kagali, as if uninterested. Then he glanced at his gun and put it in his pocket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much trouble. Let&rsquo;s just take away your fighting strength without killing you. Come on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as Kondou held up his military sword with both hands, the air changed completely. It was an atmosphere that only a master could wield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Teare, can I take over here? Let&rsquo;s do this, human!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The presence of both sides swelled up, and even those who had been fighting stopped fighting as if pressured. Kondou assumed the eight-phase posture and quietly waited for his enemy. Footman, on the other hand, was ready for a suicide attack with no consideration for defense. He covered his whole body with fighting aura, transformed himself into a huge bullet, charging at the enemy. He moved with an agility unimaginable for his fat body, moving as if he were rolling. Footman began to leap around Kondou, accelerating as he bounced off the ground. He repeated his erratic movements, accelerating faster and faster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hohoho! Try and see this move if you can!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Convinced that he had accelerated to his full strength, Footman unleashed his final technique on Kondou. Footman&rsquo;s power was called the Unique Skill &lsquo;Amplifier&rsquo;. The essence of this power was amplification.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">Whether it was waves or masses, he could increase them at will. Just by bouncing, he could accelerate, and his weight would keep increasing, making him heavier than he looked. If someone was hit by this kinetic energy, they would be crushed to pieces no matter who the opponent was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Take this&mdash;&rsquo;Angry Splatter&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Footman approached Kondou with absolute confidence and destructive power. Kondou, however, did not change his expression at all as he unleashed a sword attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;You should be honored for me to have used this, &lsquo;Rumbling of Heaven and Earth&rsquo;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c14">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only after all was said and done that his voice was quietly heard. Footman&rsquo;s hands and feet had been severed in that instant. It was an unnoticeably quick operation. It would have been impossible for him to do such a feat without an overwhelming difference in strength. Although his neck was still connected to the body, bright red blood was spurting out of it. Even so, Footman would not die, but it would be difficult to continue the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Teare, was it? Bind his hands and feet, and stop the bleeding in his neck. We don&rsquo;t want him to die yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou told her flatly. In his right hand was a pistol once again, and he reverted to his initial style. This gesture was a sign that he did not want to play with them any more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-what are you thinking&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will not kill you. Especially you, Kagali&mdash;no, ex-demon lord Kazalim. You still have use, which is why I can&rsquo;t kill you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You fool, you think I&rsquo;m going to cooperate with you after what you&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need your permission. I told you, didn&rsquo;t I? I can manipulate others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali turned her eyes of hatred towards Kondou, saying he was a hateful man. The way he said everything was annoying to say the least. It made her feel uneasy that she was wrong, even though she was sure that she was right. Every word Kondou said irritated Kagali. At that moment, Kondou&rsquo;s pistol flashed a red light. Upon seeing this, Kondou&rsquo;s mouth relaxed. It was a small, small smile. At the same time, Kagali wondered if this man could even laugh while the biggest alarm rang in her head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Stalling for time&hellip;so it was true after all!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was too late to realize it now. Although she hated herself for being played so much, Kagali continued to search for the best way forward. What to do, she did not know, but it was certain that Kondou had all the cards in his hand. It was impossible for her to escape from this situation, and it seemed difficult for her to gain more time. In that case, there was only one path to take. Kagali was left with only one option&mdash;to nip in the bud any danger that may be posed to her fellow companions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, suicide. By choosing death, she made a decision to prevent leakage of information. However, Kagali, an undead elf, would never be truly destroyed. Although she would lose her body, she could live on by inhabiting someone else once again. Footman and Teare would sense Kagali&rsquo;s intention. They were also undead elves, and like Kagali, they would never really die. By setting up Kondou at the same time, the three of them would be able to accomplish their goal without Kagali thoughts being known. Even if they lost their bodies, they could avoid the worst as long as they escaped. That was Kagali&rsquo;s decision, and it was her trump card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">It is an abomination to do this after Yuuki-sama had obtained this body for me. It took some time to settle into it, but it&rsquo;s better than losing everything. Footman and Teare will be dragged into it too, but next time I will prepare a stronger body for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali made a decision. Laplace would take care of the rest. Unexpectedly, Kondou was too strong. In Kagali&rsquo;s opinion, Kondou and Laplace were evenly matched at this stage. No, there was a possibility that Kondou was slightly stronger than Laplace. Since victory was not assured, it would be foolish to risk Laplace&rsquo;s victory even if Kondou and Laplace were able to meet each other at this point. Kagali decided as such. What she was worried about was how Kondou manipulated others. She wanted to find out before escaping, but it was dangerous to be too greedy. Kagali left her hesitation behind and took immediate action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good grief, how am I always played as a fool by human beings? Footman, Teare, stop playing around and let&rsquo;s give them everything we&rsquo;ve got. We&rsquo;ll show him the taste of my true power as a demon lord!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali spread her youki all over her body and exerted herself beyond her limits. Her temporary body could not withstand such a reckless act, and she had only a few minutes at most. On the other hand, she believed that this would prevent people from suspecting that she committed suicide. Footman and Teare also understood the strategy when they saw Kagali&rsquo;s condition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hohoho, losing a limb won&rsquo;t stop me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready for this! It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve really put my back into it, so I can&rsquo;t stop my excitement!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if matching Kagali, Footman also began leaping, curling his body into a circle. And Teare, like Kagali, began to release her youki. In the center of the capital, a huge youki swelled up. If Kondou thought that it was a suicide attack to kill with youki, Kagali and her team&rsquo;s plan would be successful. However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou did not even move his eyebrows even though he was in such a situation. He calmly put away his sword and checked the condition of his gun. Then, in a casual tone, he made a remark that made Kagali and the others feel as if cold water was dumped on them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that undead elves can survive with just a spiritual body.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a statement that could not be ignored. Among those who knew of Kagali&rsquo;s race, Yuuki was the only one. Even Damrada did not know this super-secret information, and there was no way that even Kondou could know of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How did you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The battle was all over before it began. The Armored Corps was wiped out because they underestimated the enemy and neglected to gather information. Running wildly without knowing the certainty of the situation is like a promise of defeat. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come to think of it, your person was also a disappointment. I let him make a move at the best time, but then he lost to the new demon lord. I can&rsquo;t believe he was a demon lord too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it was still better that he lost. We now have a better idea of what happened there, and we have a more interesting person than Clayman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali&rsquo;s anger exploded. Her thoughts of keeping calm were erased, and she was overcome by hatred for the man in front of her. Lieutenant Kondou. Kondou&rsquo;s statement was an admission that he had been manipulating Clayman. Clayman, as she recalled, had been running rampant for some time. Laplace reported that this tendency had increased several decades ago. Kagali had thought that it was due to the stress of becoming a demon lord, and that she was overthinking things, but if it had been Kondou&rsquo;s fault, that was a different story. The fact that every operation they had planned had ended in failure was unforgivable if he had been disturbed by Kondou&rsquo;s interference. And above all, with the death of her beloved Clayman, if Kondou had been manipulating him&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">I will not forgive. I will never forgive him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali&rsquo;s anger was not something she could control. Footman, who was sensitive to the emotion of anger, also reacted to Kagali&rsquo;s anger and amplified it. It was ironic that everything turned out the way Kondou had wanted. No, this is exactly what Kondou expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How naive. In the middle of a battle, you get emotional. It&rsquo;s that kind of determination that makes it so easy for you to fall into a trap like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou told her and pulled the trigger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A small &lsquo;pop&rsquo; sound was heard, and Kagali jumped. There was no blood. It was a very special kind of bullet, one that affected the mind, not the body. It was called the Dominion Bullet. It was a treasure given by Emperor Rudra, and was one of Kondou&rsquo;s most powerful tools.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Dominion Bullet&rsquo; contained a part of Rudra&rsquo;s power, and had the effect of controlling and manipulating others. However, it could affect only one person at a time, and a strong-minded person was likely to resist it. Although the number of the bullets was large, it was necessary to be careful about how to use it. If he failed to do so, he would expose his hand to the enemy and lose one of his pawns. If he wanted to dominate a demon lord, he had to aim at his sleeping state or make him overcome by emotion. They could be dazzled by their desires or overcome by negative emotions such as anger or sorrow. By shooting the &lsquo;Dominion Bullet&rsquo; after putting the target in such a state, domination was finally possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It took a while, but it&rsquo;s all going according to plan. Kagali, tell your men to stand down. You&rsquo;re a cautious one, so you&rsquo;ve already carved a curse on your summoners, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Kondou-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that. You can refer to me as a lieutenant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Lieutenant Kondou. As you command.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, Kagali fell into Kondou&rsquo;s hands. And just as Kondou had predicted, the souls of Yuuki&rsquo;s companions had been inscribed with a curse, so Teare and Footman were no longer able to resist Kagali&rsquo;s words. There were others who did not have a &lsquo;curse&rsquo; inscribed on their souls, but they, too, realized the disadvantage of their situation. Fighting amongst themselves was a dog&rsquo;s death waiting for them, and they decided that it was better to be captured than to resist.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence of darkness returned to the night of the Imperial Capital.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you are going to hate, hate your own powerlessness. Justice exists in as many people as there are people, and it is united by a stronger will. The same is true of ideals. Your ambitions were lost before the will of His Majesty Rudra, that is all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the absolute rule, survival of the fittest. Kondou knew it well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, those who are unaware of being trampled on are not even qualified to have ambitions. Therefore, let me remember your regret.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou himself lived with determination. That is why Kondou did not make fun of Kagali and the others. He understood from his own experience that he would suffer the same fate if he lost.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

For what seemed to be the umpteenth time, they exchanged their attacks. Yuuki, who was aiming at the vital point of the face without any hesitation, caught a back fist with his palm. He tried to grip Damrada&rsquo;s wrist, but Damrada did not allow him to do so. Damrada tried to get his hands on Yuuki&rsquo;s wrists, but Yuuki did not allow him to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anticipating the hand blows, Yuuki threw a double kick while turning his upper body backward. Damrada, sensing this, sank down on the spot and executed a foot strike, but Yuuki, perhaps reading this, leapt up and tried to cut off Damrada&rsquo;s head with a spinning kick. However, the kick only pierced the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada had already moved away and was standing up. A sophisticated exchange of martial arts beyond the human realm repeated over and over again. The movements were now so regular that it was as if they were in a well choreographed action scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the speed was too fast for the eyes of ordinary people to follow. It was a pity that there were no spectators, though it would have been difficult to find a person who was good enough to appreciate the performance. It was a combat match between masters, performed only with their own well-trained bodies. But that was not all that was actually taking place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki was trying to communicate with Damrada through &lsquo;telepathic communication&rsquo; instead of conversation. Damrada responded to Yuuki&rsquo;s attempts by assisting Yuuki&rsquo;s actions. The reason why there was so much unnecessary physical contact was that they were exchanging information in that instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Well, well, well. Damrada, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to have gained an Ultimate Skill. I didn&rsquo;t think it would be this hard to convey my &lsquo;thoughts&rsquo; to you. Did you have it since the time you met me?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I borrowed it. Of course, I have owned it since I met Yuuki-sama.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada followed up with a simple remark: &lsquo;You probably didn&rsquo;t notice it because I don&rsquo;t use it very often&rsquo;. As for Yuuki, he could only laugh. Now that he himself had been awakened to an Ultimate Skill, he was aware of the absolute difference in &lsquo;rank&rsquo; between that and the Unique Skills. In that case, Damrada&rsquo;s reply contained some words that he could not ignore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Borrowed? What does that mean?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By nature, skills were acquired by oneself. There were those who could create them, like Yuuki, but even then, they could not create something out of nothing. They were merely changing the form of a &lsquo;soul&rsquo;s power&rsquo; by feeding on their own desires. That is why he could not ignore the implication that a Skill could be transferred. Damrada replied:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;It&rsquo;s just as it sounds. My power was only given to me by the His Majesty the Emperor.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;How is that even possible?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I understand your skepticism, but I am a witness. I have no choice but to make you understand that it is possible.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I see&hellip; I guess you&rsquo;re right.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki had no choice but to agree with him. Then, the next question arose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Well, I wonder if it is possible to transfer the Skill to anyone?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;No way&rsquo;, laughed Damrada.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;No ordinary person can be a vessel of a Unique Skill, let alone an Ultimate Skill. It takes a lot of energy just to accept the power. Therefore, one must change their body like the otherworlders.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s a relief to hear. I was afraid that Emperor was having a bargain sale on Ultimate Skills.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Hahaha, that hasn&rsquo;t happened yet. Though that is what His Majesty intends to do.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I see&rsquo;, Yuuki understood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;So that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re gathering the strong.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s right. Humans, too, evolve through practice. The race itself changes and becomes a sage. If it is Yuuki-sama who has become a Saint, you must understand this, too, right?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Sort of.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki had a real feeling about it. It was impossible to go from a human being to a Sage, and then to a Saint, by simple ordinary training. Even of the &lsquo;Ten Great Saints&rsquo; who had the title of the strongest in the Western Nations, only two of them, Hinata and Sare, had reached the level of saint in the truest sense of the word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;It is only when people evolve into a Sage that they can break away from the framework of human beings, who are unable to live without communicating with other human beings. From there, it is possible to connect with the world while remaining an individual. Those who have reached this stage are gathered together in the Imperial Guardians, and have passed the minimum requirements for the selection of His Majesty Rudra.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;The minimum passing line is at the Sage level?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yes, it is. If Yuuki-sama had fought against Guy, he would have understood the strength of his opponent, right? Even if one is a Saint, there is no chance to win.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Well, that&rsquo;s true.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy&rsquo;s strength was extraordinary. He knew that very well, having actually fought him. A mere mortal would never be able to take on the Demon Lord Guy Crimson.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;The minimum requirement to beat the Guy is to have awakened to the ultimate power.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;So that&rsquo;s an Ultimate Skill.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a story that made sense to Yuuki. He himself had gained an Ultimate Skill, so he felt it even more strongly. Someone who has an Ultimate Skill can only be defeated by another Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s right. His Majesty Rudra knows this very well. That is why he gives trials to those who have reached the Sage level, to encourage their further awakening, and to train them into vessels worthy of the ultimate power.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s absurd. But I would do the same thing.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Thank you for understanding so quickly.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki and Damrada laugh at each other. Yuuki saw that the method made sense, even though it might have been incomprehensible to ordinary people. Once the methodology was established, they would be able to gather many people who were awakened to the Ultimate Skill. Although he was annoyed that they were a step ahead, Yuuki was willing to admit what he should admit. The more important issue was the peculiarity of Rudra, who was indispensable for this method.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;The fact that Rudra can give ultimate power to others, though, is a surprise.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Fufufu, that is an example that proves the greatness of His Majesty Rudra. Those who have reached the Saint level are given the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo; by His Majesty Rudra.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada&rsquo;s &lsquo;thought&rsquo; was proud. Yuuki couldn&rsquo;t help smiling as he felt his respect for Emperor Rudra. Damrada may still be loyal to Yuuki, but his feelings for Emperor Rudra were different. Even though he knew this, Yuuki still thought that he should hide it a little more. However, since Damrada usually did not make such a mistake, he must have already known it and done so deliberately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;So Rudra started a war to awaken his men?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I suppose so. The last war was also thwarted by Veldora&rsquo;s interference, but that was a good thing. Some of us evolved into Sages, and we were able to replenish our forces beyond what we lost.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki was jealous but impressed at the same time thinking that it took a lot of patience. They exchanged information through &lsquo;telepathic communication&rsquo; even as they fought. Finally, Yuuki&rsquo;s power broke through Damrada&rsquo;s psychological barrier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Oh, we did it. I found the core of the power that&rsquo;s controlling you.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s good. So, are you going to be able to disarm it?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yeah, no problem. But, won&rsquo;t Kondou find out if I deactivate it?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;They will find out, but that&rsquo;s okay.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;In that case, I&rsquo;ll go for it at once.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki and Damrada were not fighting pointlessly. Damrada knew about Yuuki&rsquo;s &lsquo;Anti-Skill&rsquo; and believed that it could break Kondou&rsquo;s &lsquo;control&rsquo; over him. Yuuki also recognized Damrada&rsquo;s idea and had been searching Damrada&rsquo;s state of mind without being prompted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Yuuki tried to restore Damrada with his newly awakened power. Yuuki&rsquo;s Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Greedy King Mammon&rsquo; was specialized in taking. With &lsquo;Steal Life Palm&rsquo;, he could steal energy just by making contact with an opponent and he could accumulate damage to an opponent just by fist-fighting. The nature of the energy, such as mana or physical strength, that could be taken away depended on the opponent. However, the fact that he could use the stolen energy remained the same. However, against Damrada, the &lsquo;Steal Life Palm&rsquo; did not work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Damrada&rsquo;s strength was excellent, and he maintained his best condition even though he was controlled by Kondou. He was doing his best to block Yuuki, regardless of his intention.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">This was made possible by the power of the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo; given by the Emperor. Damrada&rsquo;s soul was protected by this power. An absolute psychological barrier that nullified any kind of mental attack. Absolute physical destruction that penetrated all defenses. With these conflicting forces as its two wings, Damrada had become an undefeatable entity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou was able to dominate Damrada because the &lsquo;Dominion Bullet&rsquo; given to him by the Emperor was set higher than the &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s right. If &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo; had not been a borrowed power, Damrada would not have been controlled. In order to break such a troublesome &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo;, Yuuki has been using &lsquo;Anti-Skill&rsquo; to break down Damrada&rsquo;s psychological barrier. Finally, he found the &lsquo;Dominion Bullet&rsquo; that pierced Damrada&rsquo;s soul. As soon as he got the confirmation from Damrada, Yuuki concentrated his power at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Steal Life&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki&rsquo;s palm strike struck Damrada in the chest.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="Damrada RECEIVES CPR." src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The blow was precisely controlled, and it shattered only the bullet.

I&rsquo;m more worried about Kagali and the others. I&rsquo;m going over there, but what are you going to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you. We&rsquo;re meeting with Demon Lord Rimuru tomorrow anyway. Since we&rsquo;re going to stage a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat with that momentum, it would be more dangerous to go back down to Kondou.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, of course, there&rsquo;s no need to hide things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki laughed, and Damrada laughed back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shall we go then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki turned on his heel and headed for the door, and Damrada, who nodded, tried to follow him. But at that moment:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why are you playing around with the infidels, Damrada? Are you sure you are not going to betray Rudra-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A cold voice was heard, and Yuuki tensed and stopped moving. The real crisis was about to begin.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Before he knew it, she was standing there. The presence of an overwhelmingly powerful person. An incredibly beautiful woman with blue hair. Although he had never met her before, Yuuki knew the presence of this beautiful woman. It was the presence of the one who was on the other side of the curtain. The person who was called &lsquo;Marshal&rsquo; and sat next to the Emperor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ve-Velgrynd-sama&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada&rsquo;s muttering was heard loudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Velgrynd? You don&rsquo;t mean&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, Yuuki became aware that his face was scrunched up. In front of the &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo;, the strongest being in the world, he compared his own power with that of the True Dragon&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Oh, no. I didn&rsquo;t feel it when I saw Veldora before, but this is not on a level of winning or losing. Fighting head-on against such a thing is nothing but a suicide mission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki, however, did not give up. If the front door didn&rsquo;t work, he could attack through the back door. Yuuki still had a special card hidden in his bag of tricks. He felt that he could win the game as long as he could make good use of the cards he had in his hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I never thought that Her Excellency the &lsquo;Marshal&rsquo; was really a &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo;. Now I know why Guy doesn&rsquo;t move on his own.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s unusual for a human. I commend you for not being intimidated by me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you. By the way, it would be nice if you left me alone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s not me who&rsquo;s looking for you, but my dear lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as she answered, Velgrynd took a step back. Then, for the first time, Yuuki noticed the man&rsquo;s presence. He opened his eyes and stared at him. Standing next to Velgrynd was a man in very luxurious garments, seemingly to be of astronomical value. His face was one that Yuuki knew well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Masayuki? No, it can&rsquo;t be. Perhaps you&rsquo;re the one who&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki thought that he was a duplicate of Masayuki, but he noticed some differences. The most noticeable difference was the color of his hair. This man had shining blonde hair. Masayuki, on the other hand, usually dyed his hair blonde, but his natural hair was dark brown like a Japanese. If he looked closely, he could see a difference in their eyes. While Masayuki&rsquo;s eyes were somewhat dull and vacant, this man&rsquo;s eyes were full of a strong and all-seeing gaze. He could not believe that they were the same person, because of the man&rsquo;s spirit, which would consume him if he let his guard down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">It&rsquo;s a different person, isn&rsquo;t he?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Convinced of this, Yuuki came to realize the man&rsquo;s true identity. If Velgrynd called him her dear lord, it could only be one person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Emperor Rudra?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right Yuuki-sama. This is the Emperor, Rudra-sama, the pinnacle of the Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Damrada who answered. He knelt on the spot as if to show that he had no hostility towards Rudra, not caring if his clothes were soiled. Yuuki could not blame him. He knew without being told that Rudra was more important to Damrada than he was. The more important question was why Rudra was here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised. I had no idea that Your Eminence would travel to a place like this. Are you that free?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki asked as if teasing Rudra. Rudra did not get angry at him and answered normally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very busy. The game with Guy is about to be over, so I don&rsquo;t have time to play around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Damrada who surprised him. He had not expected Rudra to talk to someone inferior, nor had he expected Velgrynd to allow it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, no need to be lazy&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you say. Become my subordinate. By doing so, I will not deprive you of your free will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was an order. From high up above, commanded to those who crawled on the ground. It was the type of person Yuuki hated the most, but for some reason he could not resist it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Is this &lsquo;thought guidance&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s similar to the &lsquo;domination&rsquo; of Mariabell, but much more powerful than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was an abominable force. However, Yuuki still had &lsquo;Anti-Skill&rsquo;, so he could ignore the commands derived from Skill. It was supposed to be that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">No! This is not such a simple power!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Almost bending at the knees, Yuuki understood with a shudder. This was divinely inspired charisma</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c14">. The unimaginable, overbearing domination of a ruler who could subdue all things. Yuuki resisted with all his might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Phew, you&rsquo;re good. I didn&rsquo;t expect you to attack with such a bogus move from the very first turn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki spat out blood and was indignant. Manipulating others was his specialty, and being preempted made him angry. But he was right. The feeling of anger was proof that he had broken Rudra&rsquo;s hold on him. Yuuki looked at Rudra with a wry smile. Rudra, however, looked at Yuuki with a curious look on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Are you wondering why your power doesn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra looked back at Velgrynd as if troubled. Velgrynd then smiled and replied to the puzzled Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, Rudra, this child was exposed to your dominance and mistakenly thought he had suffered a mental attack. You must be more gentle with him or you will destroy him before he becomes your subordinate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me this isn&rsquo;t enough?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t have many people you can talk to as equals that it can be difficult for you to control your power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra looked puzzled. Velgrynd looked happy. Yuuki shivered in humiliation as he heard their conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Don&rsquo;t play with me! You think I&rsquo;m not important enough for you? In that case, let me take away that composure!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki regained his calm and opened his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll admit it. You are the rulers of this world. But to have so much power and still be unable to conquer the world is, in my opinion, the height of incompetence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As usual, he would start with a provocation. Velgrynd reacted to this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How arrogant. Come on, Rudra, let&rsquo;s kill him after all. Bringing that brat into the fold won&rsquo;t make much difference in our strength against Guy. It&rsquo;ll just be unpleasant, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In contrast to Velgrynd, Rudra was generous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. Even a worthless opponent to you can be a useful pawn if you let him grow up. And isn&rsquo;t it pleasant to be treated with defiance? A cat that doesn&rsquo;t like you is still a lovely thing. I like it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a complete lowly dismissal of Yuuki. Yuuki scoffed in an uninterested way. As long as Rudra was calm, it was pointless to provoke him. If so, he would have to use force. With Velgrynd in the room, he could not take too much time. He would strike the biggest attack with his first move, and with the momentum of the attack, he would conquer even Velgrynd. Deciding as such, Yuuki took a stance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As for being a subordinate, I have no taste for surrendering to those who are weaker than I am. If you want me to follow you, you&rsquo;ll have to show me that you have what it takes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as Yuuki shouted that, he began to take action. No more talking nonsense. There was no point in acting. The Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Greedy King Mammon&rsquo; was a skill that converted the size of one&rsquo;s desire into power. Yuuki was proud of his own greed, and he thought it was natural that the power he took from Mariabell was awakened. Therefore, Yuuki believed that he was the most powerful being, having obtained the power of &lsquo;Greedy King Mammon&rsquo;. It was a power of the great sin system, and he had no doubts about himself. Which one should Yuuki target?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had to choose Rudra. He would control Rudra and take him as a hostage to Velgrynd. If he could get through this critical situation, he would turn this disaster into a blessing. Such bullish thinking was the driving force of Yuuki, and he had been successful so far. This time, too, he would win and make great progress. With this in mind, Yuuki ran forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In just a few steps, his fists were within reach. In less time than it took to blink, Yuuki&rsquo;s hand was about to touch Rudra. In his right hand, he activated &lsquo;Life Sucker&rsquo;, one of the powers of the &lsquo;Greedy King Mammon&rsquo;, and then Anti-Skill&rsquo; in his left hand was used in conjunction. In this way, a vicious attack that penetrated through the opponent&rsquo;s barriers was created. This was the original use of &lsquo;Steal Life&rsquo;. Unlike the case of Damrada, Yuuki attacked with a force where he did not care if he killed his opponent or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Rudra died, he could concentrate just on Velgrynd. It would be difficult to escape from two strong opponents, but it would not be so difficult to escape from only one of them. If Rudra survived, it would be time to use the left hand. The effect of the left hand was &lsquo;manipulation of the mind&rsquo;. It was a terrifying power that stimulated the target&rsquo;s emotion and even affected their memory. It was a power of domination more vicious and assured than Mariabell&rsquo;s &lsquo;desire&rsquo;. Yuuki was planning to find a way out by using this two-stage sequence. However, this idea was easily crushed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let Rudra touch you in front of me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd moved forward with such speed that Yuuki, who had pushed his physical abilities to the limit, could not follow her with his eyes. Then, Velgrynd caught Yuuki&rsquo;s right hand without any difficulty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki was astonished. It was a surprise that he had been prevented from striking his right hand, but what was more shocking was the amount of energy that flowed into his hand from Velgrynd. It was such a raging torrent that Yuuki was about to vomit blood. In a single moment of crossing, the magicules had invaded Yuuki&rsquo;s body beyond the limit. Yuuki instantly sensed the danger and twisted his body to get away from it. If he had reacted even a little later, Yuuki&rsquo;s body would have been completely destroyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd did not do anything. On the contrary, she did nothing except to catch Yuuki&rsquo;s hand. Nevertheless, Yuuki was damaged, which was, in a sense, a self-destruction. It was just that he had taken uncontrollable energy with his &lsquo;Steel Life Palm&rsquo;. Yuuki thought to himself as he vomited blood and shed tears and nosebleeds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">No way, can it be? It easily exceeded my tolerance level! I currently have a limit to accept a dozen higher spirits. How insane is this &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo; that the limit can be met in an instant?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Feeling like complaining to god, Yuuki grumbled. The truly fearful one was Velgrynd. She was so calm, as if she didn&rsquo;t even feel an itch, even though she had been deprived of that much energy. In other words, it meant that she did not even need to defend herself against Yuuki&rsquo;s attack. Yuuki realized that there was no way out of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Damn, I didn&rsquo;t expect there to be such a power gap. No wonder they didn&rsquo;t care about me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was unquestionably Guy&rsquo;s equal. Seeing this, Yuuki now understood the height of the world. Because he had awakened the Ultimate Skill, he understood the hopeless disparity between the two. It was suicidal to attack by himself. Now, he had no other choice but to wait for the enemy&rsquo;s move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be tactless. Since I have come all the way here myself, it would be a pleasure to answer your wish to know my power, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a bad habit, Rudra. It&rsquo;ll be boring to get hurt, so let me help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a provocation. Yuuki could not keep silent when someone tried to take away his own specialty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, you know what I mean. If I accept reality, that means that I&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;ve already lost. But you know, I&rsquo;m not a quitter. Don&rsquo;t expect me to simply surrender.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki, aware of the fact that he was a sore loser, made a grand gesture. Now that he realized that he could not beat Velgrynd no matter what, the only thing he could do was protect his pride. Even if it would mean his death, he was determined to follow his selfishness to the end. Yuuki glared at Rudra with such spirit. Rudra smiled at Yuuki&rsquo;s glare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;After all, I&rsquo;ll deal with him myself. Let me tell you first that I am good at &lsquo;domination&rsquo;. If you can withstand this, you win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki&rsquo;s eyes narrowed when he heard this unexpected offer. Rudra meant what he said. He truly meant that he did not mind if Yuuki ran away. Although Yuuki could not read Rudra&rsquo;s intention, Rudra&rsquo;s thinking was simple. If Yuuki accumulated more experience, he would be able to gain more power. On that basis, he would be able to negotiate with Yuuki again one day to bring him to his side. Yuuki and Rudra were different beings. Therefore, Yuuki felt that Rudra was creepy and resented that he was being treated as a fool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Good at domination, are you? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m good at, too. I&rsquo;ll bet it all on the power of the &lsquo;Greedy King Mammon&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra looked at Yuuki with amusement, and his heart was filled with excitement at the prospect of competing for the first time in a long time. If Yuuki could withstand his &lsquo;domination&rsquo;, he might be leading a bug into his lion&rsquo;s den. Despite this possibility, Rudra chose to play the game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">If it crumbles here, then my supremacy will have been just that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He did not bother to think about losing. If Yuuki pretended to follow him, that would be a good thing. He was confident that he was a ruler who would rule the world by taming such pawns. Velgrynd had known Rudra for a long time. She understood what Rudra was thinking without being told. Therefore, she understood that there was no use in rebuking him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right. Then, if you lose, I will avenge you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, Velgrynd stepped back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is a needless worry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra stepped forward with a wry smile. Yuuki, too, forced his screaming body to stand up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Funny, you guys. No wonder Guy called you a joker who stirs up the game board.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;How did you know that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hoo, was it the Moderate Clown Troupe? Tatsuya just reported in. We have the chairman of the Moderate Clown Troupe. I should let you know that I have all the information about you. You may challenge me with that in mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tatsuya was Lieutenant Kondou. Rudra must have been in contact with Kondou in some way who had reported that he had now taken Kagali. Yuuki, realizing this, let out a deep sigh&mdash;it was bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, everything about Yuuki&rsquo;s peculiar constitution and the conversation he had with Guy was now known to all of them. Yuuki had told those whom he trusted that he had awakened to his Ultimate Skill. Damrada seemed to have kept the secret, but it was meaningless in this situation. Kagali was Yuuki&rsquo;s confidant, and of course he shared the secret with him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Oh, man, what a mess. So then they know everything about me&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki felt like giving up everything. However, his pride would not allow him to retreat at this point. And more than anything else&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Is Kagali not dead too? It seems that Rudra himself is the one who dominates, and Kondou can handle the same kind of power. If so, it would be better to just&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki made a plan in that instant. Although the probability of success was very low, he felt lighter than if he had simply taken on the challenge without any plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is very kind of you. But you know, being kind can mean the death of you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem. I&rsquo;m of the disposition to consider myself completely victorious only when I surpass my opponent&rsquo;s all-out effort. So, you, too, do your best without any regrets.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as he said this, Rudra took another step forward. Then he took a unique stance, unarmed. Rudra was a swordsman by nature. The sword on his waist was proof of this, and he intended to use only the power of &lsquo;domination&rsquo; against Yuuki, as he had declared. Yuuki had already recognized Rudra&rsquo;s character. He was honest and sincere in his fight, which was not typical of a ruler. That was why he was easy to read.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Frankly, it&rsquo;s impossible to win in any honest sense. Even if I could manage Rudra, there would still be Velgrynd. Since escape from this place is impossible, all I can do is to nullify Rudra&rsquo;s &lsquo;domination&rsquo;, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, Rudra was expecting that. He had overwhelming confidence that he could control Yuuki. Then, the only thing Yuuki could do was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on, Rudra!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki risked everything on a small chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Regalia Dominion!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra moved in a very beautiful motion, and in an instant, the distance between Yuuki and Rudra became zero. Then he invoked the &lsquo;Domination of the Champion&rsquo;. This was the essence of Rudra&rsquo;s power to subdue anyone&mdash;Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo;. Unlike the counterfeit one lent to Kondou, this one had no limitations and its power was far superior to any other. There was a difference in the &lsquo;quality&rsquo; of Ultimate Skills as well. It was impossible for the newly awakened Yuuki to resist this power.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra stood tall. Yuuki crumpled to the ground. The winner seemed clear, but the result was unknown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t want me to kill him? These guys will just pretend to obey you and then try to take your head off in your sleep, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. That&rsquo;s the best part. I&rsquo;ll let him off the hook as a reward for resisting my control.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite his words, Rudra&rsquo;s confidence did not waver. Convinced of his absolute &lsquo;dominance&rsquo;, he never doubted his victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The winner, Rudra, smiled wryly. Then he turned to Damrada, who had melted into a corner of the room, and spoke to him in a friendly manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Forgive me, Damrada, but I cannot be disturbed by you just yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everything will be done according to Your Majesty&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was all that was needed for the two of them to communicate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When he wakes up, you take care of him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satisfied with the reply, Rudra left with Velgrynd in tow. The purge had just begun. As the Emperor moved, the times would change. The capital, too, would not escape the upheaval. It was on that day. The sky turned red in spite of the midnight hour, and crimson rain poured down incessantly, enveloping the night.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c19" id="h.jdmac6ilq8h4"><span class="c10">Chapter 4</span></h2><p class="c35"><span class="c20 c14">The Purge of the Red Lotus</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">The Eastern city of the Armed Nation of Dwargon was now blockaded by 60,000 men. However, that was just a cover-up. Both sides had made it known behind the scenes that they were allied with each other. The commanders were worried about the possibility of an unfortunate accident. In such a situation, the air of the soldiers at the end of the line was light. Tents were set up for encampment, and chit-chat bloomed in the tents. Even so, everyone maintained a moderate sense of tension. Every single soldier was in the same state of mind, so it could be said that the training level of the soldiers was remarkably high. No wonder their morale was so high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, their superiors were in the midst of their final meeting. Their dreams of overthrowing the Empire and establishing a new nation would be decided at that meeting. Everyone was looking forward to it, and everyone&rsquo;s eyes were filled with expectation toward the capital. That is why so many people noticed at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So red, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is the capital on fire?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What happened? No, did they find out our plan?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something was happening in the capital on this important day. No one thought this was a coincidence. Everyone there realized that something had happened to the executives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Should we send out a scouting party?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s better to be organized.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You idiot! If we do that, our treachery will be completely exposed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The absence of a superior meant that there was no one to command. The Mixed Corps, which was originally ridiculed as a hodgepodge, had become unmanageable all at once. A big man, who had kept his eyes closed until then, threatened them. His name was Zero. He was the man Yuuki had assigned as the deputy corps commander, and he was the supreme commander of the corps at this moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quiet! I will not tolerate arbitrary action. We will stay here and wait for Yuuki-sama and the others to arrive. There will be no change to that policy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zero&rsquo;s assurance of this calmed down those who had been divided. Since they did not know what the right answer was, they decided to follow the orders of their superiors. Even so, however, their uneasiness did not disappear&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their fears came true in the worst possible way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good evening, you fools. Just because it&rsquo;s a nice night, doesn&rsquo;t mean you should get too excited.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leisurely. As easy as taking a walk. The woman came down the street. A very beautiful woman with blue hair, it was none other than Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-who are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soldiers on the outer edge of the roadside made a commotion and looked at Velgrynd. It was no ordinary person who would address an encamped army. Even before that, anyone who was unaware of Velgrynd&rsquo;s unusual presence could not have survived in the Mixed Corps. At the same time as confirming the identity of Velgrynd, a message was also sent to the superiors. Soldiers moved to surround Velgrynd. In the midst of all this, a man who was confident in his abilities stepped forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, woman, I don&rsquo;t know who you are, but you&rsquo;d better not pick a fight with this many people. We may look like this, but we&rsquo;re the Mixed Corps, the most powerful&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny that the weak claim to be the strongest, isn&rsquo;t it? I would have tolerated it if it had boosted morale, but I think it would be better not to allow it at the corps level.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s words were those of an overwhelmingly superior person. A being who could give orders to an organization called an army from the top. Even the smallest soldier could see that this was a dangerous being. Naturally, Zero, the deputy corps commander, was also aware of the situation. When Zero heard that the other party was alone, he moved to confirm its identity with his own eyes. Upon hearing the report, he rushed to the site. Then, he saw Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Lord Marshal&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Zero had never seen the Marshal&rsquo;s face. However, the atmosphere was unmistakably the same as that of the being that always radiated an overwhelming presence on the other side of the curtain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, so some of you are a little smart. Good. I&rsquo;ve been told not to kill you all. I&rsquo;ll play with you until Kondou and the others arrive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With these words, the tragedy began.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

The war was still going on, and that alone was a headache. But it was more than that. Upon hearing Jaine&rsquo;s report, he felt his stomach begin to perforate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">What in the world is Rimuru thinking, letting his men evolve into True Demon Lords?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would have taught him a lesson if he&rsquo;d been there&mdash;Gazel sighed heavily. The phrase &lsquo;True Demon Lord&rsquo; was loaded with meaning. A &lsquo;demon lord&rsquo; was a title, meaning a monster king who ruled a territory. On the other hand, &lsquo;True Demon Lord&rsquo; referred to the state of a monster. When a &lsquo;Demon Lord Seed&rsquo; had awakened and evolved, it was simply called a &lsquo;True Demon Lord&rsquo;. Actually, it was more accurate to say that it was just less than Catastrophe-class and the highest of a Disaster-class.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">&hellip;No, there are not so many Disaster-class, so it is not the highest rank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Disaster-class was a classification for demon lord. As such, only eight of them were applicable to this category now. It was assumed that several subordinates who had the same power as that of the highest-ranking ones had been born under Rimuru. It was a headache just to think about it. At any rate, Gazel complained to Elmesia as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He couldn&rsquo;t stand being the only one who suffered from this problem. So, he decided to share his pain with Elmesia. In conclusion, it was decided to continue the observation of Rimuru&rsquo;s group until a problem occurred. This was actually a postponement of the problem, but it was the best they could do since nothing could actually be done. If they ever decided that there was a real danger, it would mean the beginning of a battle for the survival of the human race.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want that to happen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel sighed to himself. Gazel received another piece of bad news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh my. The Mixed Corps is on the move! It appears that they are engaged in a war with someone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The voice was calm, but Gazel sensed the panic that was typical of the darker side. Before he could get a more detailed report, he sent out a messenger to summon Dolph and the others. A few minutes later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it. That is not the work of a mere person. It&rsquo;s a monster. Not even a demon lord, but a monster beyond imagination.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;A True Dragon, huh?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ah. I&rsquo;ve never seen her before, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s Velgrynd, even though she looks like a human.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a &lsquo;Magic Communication&rsquo; from Admiral Paladin Vaughn, who was on assignment in the Eastern city. Gazel and the others understood the situation by having the images transferred to them. The worst thing always happened when they least expected it. Gazel now understood this fact painfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sky was on fire. A Beautiful woman danced coolly, and powerful men fell to the ground one by one. The flames were beautiful and awe-inspiring. But the real horror came later. Velgrynd, who was reflected in the crystal ball for the surveillance magic, turned her eyes towards Gazel and the others. Just as Gazel was thinking it to be a coincidence, the crystal ball shattered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She was watching us too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it. That&rsquo;s ridiculous&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way! How far away do you think we are?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth. They may have sensed the magic and traced it back to the caster. Even so, how could they affect the destination of the magic transfer? Such a thing is impossible even for me&hellip;well&hellip;for a human being!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel listened silently to the words of his friends. The current incident made it clear that the other party was the enemy. But who was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Stop, don&rsquo;t spy on me&rsquo;&mdash;he thought he heard in his ears, even though he couldn&rsquo;t hear anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">A True Dragon, huh? It&rsquo;s a true monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel now understood the true meaning of the word &lsquo;strongest&rsquo;. He had heard rumors of a connection between the Empire and Velgrynd. There had been no way to determine the truth or falsity of such rumors, but he had made many assumptions so that he would be able to withstand an attack if one were to occur. However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel realized that this may have been nothing more than a delusion. It was unclear why the Empire had chosen now to send Velgrynd. No matter how much Gazel tried to understand what Emperor Rudra was thinking, he couldn&rsquo;t comprehend the situation. There was only one thing Gazel could do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I shall go into battle myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your Majesty, that&rsquo;s too dangerous!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even so, he must go. Abandoning Vaughn will not save Dwargon. Dolph, be ready.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Jaine spoke, Dolph had no choice but to remain silent. He had no intention of letting Vaughn die and realized that admonishing Gazel at this point would not change the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will be ready to leave as soon as possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel nodded gravely and closed his eyes. There was a lot of work to do. The allies had to be notified, and instructions had to be given on how to deal with the remaining citizens. If Gazel and his allies won, that was good, but if they lost, what would they do? There was nowhere for the people to run. They would have no other means of survival than to submit to the Empire. That would mean the collapse of the nation of Dwargon, and to prevent that from happening, Gazel and his people could not afford to lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The eastern cities will not have room for the entire army. Let us leave the rear to march on the ground and leave the command to the old men. Jaine, it&rsquo;s up to you to convince them!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand. So, King Gazel, what are you going to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go first. After all, if I show up too late, I won&rsquo;t be able to have my turn, so plan accordingly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel smiled wryly as he said this. Playing the role of a powerful king, he tried to allay everyone&rsquo;s fears. Thus, the army was organized as quickly as possible. Gazel and his men did not wait long, and set out with only the Pegasus Knights led by Dolph.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Gazel flew through the sky, he suddenly thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">Is the reason why Rimuru gave his men power so that they could survive the war? If so, I have to say that he is being as lenient as ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He realized the truth and couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. He could not stop the smile from forming on his lips as he thought of his younger apprentice (Rimuru), who never gave up on his naive ideals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it, your majesty?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s just a harmless fantasy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but what do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu, in spite of such a desperate situation, I suddenly remembered Rimuru. And then, for some reason, I felt that this time too, I could get through this crisis.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was being too optimistic, but Gazel still thought it was better than being pessimistic as he laughed thoughtfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. As was the case with Charybdis, His Majesty Rimuru was also quite guileless. I was quite shocked by his connection with Demon Lord Milim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph laughed as he answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you are going to say that, I might as well mention the hardships those of us had to endure while monitoring the situation. We were getting tired of being accused of lying about whatever was reported.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Anrietta, who was usually taciturn and answered only what was asked of her&mdash;though sometimes sarcastic&mdash;said so. Gazel and Dolph could not hide their surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufufu, I&rsquo;m sorry about that. I&rsquo;ll try to be better next time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So Anrietta-dono had grievances as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wahahahaha! In that case Anrietta, say that to that Rimuru guy directly. I have trouble on my side too. I trust you guys, but Rimuru&rsquo;s behavior is just so insane. When I heard Jaine&rsquo;s report, I honestly doubted Jaine&rsquo;s sanity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haha, that report was outrageous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Since I am usually the one to report, I enjoyed it this time as a spectator.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel and Dolph erupted in laughter at Anrietta&rsquo;s sarcasm. The sky was filled with echoing laughter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I would also like to mention something. I had also sent a message to His Majesty Rimuru with a complaint.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel nodded and looked forward. His unease was gone. Gazel flew towards the battlefield, radiating the high spirits befitting of a champion.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

The day after drinking with Elmesia-san, the sun had already reached its zenith.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up early, Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">The smiling Shuna was just so scary. The only option was to apologize, so I took the initiative. What&rsquo;s the big deal about getting drunk and sleeping in</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been trying to say, but I wondered if I should be scolded for it. Shuna let out a big sigh and looked at me with a stern stare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, have you reached a conclusion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-what are you talking about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;You were troubled last night, weren&rsquo;t you? I am afraid that you are going to do something reckless again, I was also</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">no, not only me, but all of us were worried.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t help but be touched when she said that. Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m not going to do anything reckless. If not, I will run away, and I will complain to Guy and ask him to do something about it. But before that, I was going to give something a try.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll figure it out. Safety is the number one priority this time, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I answered cheerfully, but Shuna kept an anxious look on her face. I guess it was impossible to fool Shuna who had the Unique Skill &lsquo;Analyst&rsquo;. Or perhaps it would have been obvious even without it. It was just as well. I really didn&rsquo;t want to do something dangerous like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although I said I&rsquo;d put safety first, we still didn&rsquo;t fully know the enemy&rsquo;s strength. In particular, Lieutenant Kondou, Velgrynd, and Emperor Rudra were all powerful opponents no matter how you looked at it. Not only was it an unwinnable situation, but there was a possibility that we might be killed on the spot. I tried to find a way to avoid such a possibility, but even Wisdom King Raphael-san could not find an answer to this question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I don&rsquo;t know the answer, it was just a matter of guessing. The only thing I could do was to reduce the danger as much as possible by putting my maximum effort into the project. And that&rsquo;s how we got here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, I was having a hard time deciding who to take with me. This time, I&rsquo;m going with only an elite group. I feel bad saying this, but those who are not strong enough to go would only be a liability.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Yes. My brother was very determined to go with you since this morning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that my thoughts really had been exposed. I had been dealing with Elmesia-san since yesterday morning, so I hadn&rsquo;t told everyone about my talk with Guy yet. And yet, Shuna was smiling at me, as if she understood everything. I smiled, thinking that I was no match for her. Shuna reported to me in a natural manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Last night, the mysterious Laplace arrived. He said he had a message for Rimuru-sama, but since he didn&rsquo;t make a request in advance, we are keeping him waiting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a sudden change of subject, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to be of that much importance. If it really was urgent, Gadra or the others would have contacted us. I guess Yuuki was the person from whom the message was sent, but I wondered what the message was about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit of a hassle, but let&rsquo;s meet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I really wanted to turn him away, but he is still an ally for now. In that case, I will show you to the reception room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna didn&rsquo;t like Laplace either. Unusually for Shuna, who rarely expressed her likes and dislikes in her attitude, she was very blunt in her treatment of the clowns. After all, she couldn&rsquo;t easily forgive Laplace and the others for causing the death of the ogre village. We shouldn&rsquo;t forget that, even if they are our allies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;While I&rsquo;m talking to Laplace, gather the executives who are awake in the conference room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked Shuna to do so. I had a lot of things to think about, but I would worry about all of them after the war with the Empire was over. I placed my doubts out of my mind and decided to take care of the immediate problems first.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Twenty people, including myself, gathered in the conference room. Rigurd and four of the elders under him&mdash;Rugurd, Regurd, Rogurd, and Lilina-san. Kaijin, Vesta, and Myourmiles-kun were also here. Then there were seven members of the &lsquo;Twelve Chaos Guardian Lords&rsquo;. There was also Benimaru, Shion, Diablo, Gabil, and the three demon girls, Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera. Finally, there was Souei, Hakurou, Gobta, and Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was going to ask Gadra to be our guide in the Empire. To be honest, I thought it was a little bit too much, but Gadra was the one who would be the least sad if something happened to me, so I had chosen him for this mission. By the way, Bernie was also asked to be a guide for the Empire. However, he rejected the offer, because he was a liability to us now that he had lost his power. Gadra would be enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, let&rsquo;s see then. I feel like I&rsquo;ve only been having meetings all this time, but I can&rsquo;t complain about that. Our country has grown too big now to just decide everything by our own will. Having said that, I would just tell everyone what I had decided this time. Shuna, as usual, served tea to everyone. After making sure he had left quietly, I opened my mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The reason I asked you all to gather here is to inform you of the decision regarding the final battle against the Empire. But before that&hellip; Come on in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had already decided who we were taking with us, so there was no need to panic for now. Instead, I had decided to introduce Laplace, who had come as an emissary, to everyone. Laplace&rsquo;s message, as I had expected, was related to the joint struggle. The army blockading the east entrance of Dwargon was going to attack the capital, and he wanted us to join them. It was as Guy told me, and I was not planning to deny it. However, I had come to the conclusion that it would not be a battle of armies, but instead a battle of the elites.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since I did not want to cause any damage to civilians, I had come to the conclusion that I needed to discuss the details with Yuuki. And so, I decided to set up a meeting on short notice. I had already discussed this with Yuuki through Laplace, and the date had been set for tomorrow afternoon. I would explain the situation to the assembled people. I really wanted to leave everything to Laplace, but he was too shady and I wouldn&rsquo;t let him do it. I was once again reminded of the importance of trust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello, hello, hello, everybody. I am Laplace. I&rsquo;m the vice president of the Moderate Clown Troupe, and Yuuki-san, our boss, sent me this time as an emissary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wow, he&rsquo;s still such a suspicious-looking guy. I didn&rsquo;t understand why it was necessary to dance at a time like this, but, well, he was sent as an emissary, so I couldn&rsquo;t just ignore him.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="A CLOWNLY POWER" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1">It seems I wasn&rsquo;t the only one who was annoyed, as Souei was even preparing to make a dangerous move. I understood his feelings, but I&rsquo;d have to ask him to hold back here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Souei-kun, put away that kunai.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Stay on your guard, Souei. He sat down quietly, but one could never be too careful. Let&rsquo;s just finish the introduction quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Laplace-san here is the contact person for Yuuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can just call me Laplace if ya want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yeah? Well, then I&rsquo;ll do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since he said so, I would take his word for it. I was just going to do whatever I wanted to do, regardless of whether he was a messenger or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yuuki and I will be having a meeting tomorrow. It&rsquo;s a bit sudden, but Laplace is going to take me there, so there&rsquo;s no need to worry about the travel time. The important thing is who will go with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And finally, we got to the point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can only bring up to six people at a time. Since myself and His Majesty Rimuru have already been confirmed, who are the other four people?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Truthfully, I would have liked to bring the strongest to fight. But currently, we did not have all of our members anyway. Ranga was sleeping in my shadow. Geld was not yet awake. Kumara, Zegion, and Adalmann, the labyrinthine group, were also holed up in their own domains and showed no sign of waking up. Since there were individual differences in evolutionary sleep, I understood that this was just how things were. For now, I&rsquo;d just have to confirm who would go between those who were able.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru, I need you to come with me. How are you feeling?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, does he have a cold or something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace asked with a puzzled look, but I was not going to tell him about the awakening. I knew he would find out sooner or later, but I was not kind enough to explain it to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem. I&rsquo;m in excellent condition.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru smiled wryly, completely ignoring Laplace and maintaining his cool demeanor. Unlike me, he had a big heart, and I was impressed at times like this. I looked at Benimaru carefully and saw that he had somehow changed his race. It seems that Benimaru had evolved successfully and things were going well with Momiji and Alvis. It was only later that I heard the following story. Benimaru had to take turns with his new wives over the course of two nights. I should be saying that I was very proud of him&hellip;but I was really just jealous as hell&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After abandoning his physical body, he was reborn and had become a full spiritual life form. His race was called a &lsquo;flame spirit oni&rsquo;, a kind of divine spirit. Like the &lsquo;True Dragons&rsquo;, he had both the holy and demonic attributes, so he could also be called a holy demonic spirit. A divine monster spirit was a subordinate existence of the &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo; race. Like the &lsquo;True Dragons&rsquo;, they had various attributes, and fire was considered to be a major attribute. Attributes were the laws that governed the principles of this world, and there were eight kinds in total.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were the natural attributes of &lsquo;earth&rsquo;, &lsquo;water&rsquo;, &lsquo;fire&rsquo;, and &lsquo;wind&rsquo; and the attribute of &lsquo;space&rsquo;. These were known as the five major attributes. It was said that fire was strong against earth, water was strong against fire, wind was strong against water, space was strong against wind, and earth was strong against space. The earth was consumed by fire, fire was extinguished by water, water was dissipated by wind, wind was isolated by space, and space was indexed only by the earth. In such a way, the five major attributes were in a conflicting relationship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition to these five attributes, there were two opposing attributes, &lsquo;light&rsquo; and &lsquo;darkness&rsquo;, along with the attribute of &lsquo;time&rsquo;, which was not bound by anything and reigned over all attributes. Fire spirits such as Ifrit were also bound by these physical laws. Or rather, spirits were the embodiment of the laws of the world, and they also had eight attributes. It seems that &lsquo;light&rsquo; and &lsquo;darkness&rsquo; were special, and light was derived from angels while darkness was derived from demons. It seems that angels and demons, which were confirmed now, could also be called spirits if we traced back their origins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo and others might be able to say more about this, but it didn&rsquo;t make much sense to me, and I was not particularly interested in knowing about it. The important thing was that there were eight kinds of divine spirits, and they were higher than normal spirits. The highest among them were the &lsquo;True Dragons&rsquo;, of which only four had been confirmed as of now. Veldanava, the &lsquo;Star King Dragon&rsquo;, I think, had the attributes of space and earth, associated with stars. Perhaps, there may have been many more attributes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Frost Dragon&rsquo; Velzard was likely water-based.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Scorch Dragon&rsquo; Velgrynd was most certainly fire-based.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And our &lsquo;Veldora-san&rsquo;, apart from water and wind, could even control space. He was a surprisingly great guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In short, the &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo; race was the pinnacle of the divine spirits. And Benimaru had evolved into a being similar to that of a &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo;. Although a &lsquo;flame spirit oni&rsquo; was a spiritual life form, he had a physical body so that he could influence the material world. It appeared that his lifespan had no boundaries, so it would not be an exaggeration to call him a divine oni.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was impressed by this truly special evolution. As for the total magicule count, it had also increased greatly. In my opinion, it was several times larger than that of Karion&rsquo;s. It may not be as large as Luminas in terms of maximum value, but it seemed to be a good match for it. I believed he would be able to compete with the &lsquo;Single Digits&rsquo; of the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Great! Then Benimaru will be the first choice. And now, for the second person&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was chosen, so we are left with two more people. Shion and Diablo would also go with us, so I would have exactly four members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gadra for directions. Shion and Diablo as my secretaries.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The people who would be taken by Laplace would be me, Gadra, Benimaru, Shion, and Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me, Rimuru-sama! You&rsquo;ll be safe and sound with me!&rdquo; Shion said with a big smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What are you talking about? I was quite anxious, but I knew I could count on Shion as an escort. She had defeated Razul, who was a superior fighter, and in terms of combat, Shion was a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu. I don&rsquo;t know what Guy is up to, but it was outrageous of him to bother Rimuru-sama. I will go with you and see to it that all of your worries are removed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was as confident as ever. But it was not wrong to say that we were in good hands with Diablo. He was capable of doing his job, and this was the time to rely on him. Although we were an elite group, we could not rest on our laurels. The rest of those remaining would follow, and I would ask them to come to the Empire later. I was about to say that, but before I could, someone expressed their dissatisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please wait, Rimuru-sama. I think I would be better suited to be your guide. Please allow me to accompany you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">It was Testarossa. Indeed, Testarossa was from the imperial side and seemed to know the geography well. She was an active military attach&eacute; and also a skilled negotiator. She was a good fighter too</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">in fact, she might even be stronger than me. The only advantage of taking Gadra with us was that he may or may not be able to meet Yuuki. If I thought about it though, I&rsquo;d be able to manage without him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was also strong, but not as strong as Testarossa. Besides, there was still a fear of not knowing if he would defect. Because of that, I felt that I would not have to be sad no matter what happened, though I also felt a little sorry for him. I would take Testarossa&rsquo;s advice here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;ll swap out Gadra and have Testarossa come in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you very much for your kindness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa smiled beautifully. Oh, how gorgeous. Gadra did not seem to have any complaints either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, it looks like things are decided, so I&rsquo;m gonna go get ready. Please give me a call when we leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, but what do you mean &lsquo;get ready&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I asked him what he needed to do to get ready, Laplace gave me a bashful look.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-Well, that&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the hot springs. This guy has been going back and forth between the cafeteria and the hot spring since yesterday, enjoying the recreation facilities like nobody else!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei reported to us in an irritated tone. It&rsquo;s no wonder we have to keep an eye on him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, so ya knew. That&rsquo;s not very nice, Souei-san.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could we not know? Laplace had some guts, didn&rsquo;t he?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You paid for it, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, ya see, I&rsquo;m a guest, right? I&rsquo;ll repay ya with my future work, so please just pay for this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How cheeky!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, well, well, isn&rsquo;t it this country&rsquo;s fault for being too wonderful? Right now, this place is the most advanced in the world, no doubt about it! It&rsquo;s a paradise. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to relax here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace then emphasized the advantages of this country. It didn&rsquo;t feel bad being praised that much. I think Laplace is a nice guy. My impression of him has changed a bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being deceived, Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Benimaru. I will keep an eye on Rimuru-sama even if he lets his guard down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oops. I&rsquo;m going to be careful after listening to Benimaru and the others&rsquo; conversation. One cough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just in moderation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I get what ya mean! Well, I&rsquo;ll leave ya to it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as Laplace said this, he walked out of the conference room with a cheerful look on his face. After seeing him run off like a free spirit, I decided to move on to the next item on the agenda.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

If something happens to Rimuru-sama, no matter how many victories we have in the war, we will not be able to recover.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I agree that an army is useless in a battle of the elites, but there must be someone who can shield Rimuru-sama in case of an emergency.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei, Gabil, and Hakurou, in turn, expressed their objections to the previous plan. They seemed to have been dissatisfied with it, although they had kept silent in front of Laplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Master Hakurou is right. I, too, am prepared to take Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s place when the time comes. It&rsquo;s called a meat shield, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Gobta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meat shield, huh? While I can imagine what he&rsquo;s trying to say, I&rsquo;d really appreciate it if he didn&rsquo;t do that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hakurou, please stop educating Gobta about such things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand. But please realize that it is important to teach them to be prepared for such a case.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou&rsquo;s point was understandable. It&rsquo;s just that my heart could not accept it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you all care about me, but I care about everyone else, too. I do not want to make a plan that assumes sacrifice from the start, so let&rsquo;s just all pool our wisdom in order to avoid such a situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It seems I may be getting a little ahead of myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps they were not convinced. On this issue, even Benimaru and the others seemed to be on Hakurou&rsquo;s side. I might have felt the same way if I were in a different position. But even so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">I was happy for everyone&rsquo;s feelings, but I still didn&rsquo;t want to see anyone else sacrificed.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">I know it&rsquo;s selfish, but I would put my feelings first here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In any case, it&rsquo;s not okay to have a war strategy that requires sacrifice. With that in mind, let&rsquo;s move on to the final stage of the war against the Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone nodded in agreement with me. Regardless of their sentiments, it should be possible to calmly formulate a strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, I have an idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it, Souei?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am currently sneaking my &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; into the Empire. I haven&rsquo;t reached the capital yet because of many obstacles, but it seems that the security network is more relaxed than before. I am thinking of joining Laplace&rsquo;s teleportation by using &lsquo;Shadow Step&rsquo;. Is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, that was reassuring. Souei&rsquo;s excellence as a covert agent could be especially felt at a time like this. His combat ability was also impeccable. And upon closer inspection, I was able to see that he had evolved. Souei was not just an oni, but a &lsquo;dark spirit oni&rsquo;. It seemed that Souei had also received a gift in conjunction with the evolution of Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei had been raised as a shadow of Benimaru in the ogre village. Benimaru was the front end and Souei was the back end. Although they were in a hierarchical relationship, they were still the best of friends. In other words, he was Benimaru&rsquo;s counterpart. Because they were such a pair, the influence of Benimaru&rsquo;s awakening was most strongly felt by him. Presumably, Souei was being treated like a subordinate to Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, it seems that his attitude was the same as before, so it did not seem to be a big problem. A &lsquo;dark spirit oni&rsquo; was like a dark demonic spirit, and like Benimaru, he had a physical body while still being a spiritual life form. Was he being treated as a subordinate deity of Benimaru? He was not as high-ranking a demon, but he did have a medium amount of magicules. The total was not as high as Benimaru&rsquo;s, but it was higher than the half-awakened Clayman&rsquo;s had been.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His strength was enough. The current Souei could fight with Karion, Frey, and other ex-demon lords at least on equal terms. Was it because of this evolution that he was now able to get through the imperial vigilance? I thought so, but I didn&rsquo;t care either way. Souei was welcome to come along, so I had nothing to complain about. But then again, there still remained the problem of Masayuki&rsquo;s escort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s reassuring. But what about Masayuki?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will continue to monitor with my &lsquo;Clone&rsquo;. If anything goes wrong, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be able to handle it.&rdquo; Souei answered confidently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo also interrupted from the side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, why don&rsquo;t you let Venom mix in as one of Masayuki&rsquo;s associates? As long as we do not tell the boy, he can serve as both a protector and a watchdog. Souei-dono&rsquo;s burden would be lightened, and it would also serve as an insurance policy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, that was a good idea. Venom had a sensible character, unlike most demons, and was strong in his own way. He and Masayuki seemed to get along well with each other. It would be interesting to entrust him with this project.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, your second-in-command will be gone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, no problem. Testarossa and the others are here, so my own work will not be affected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then we were all set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Souei, is that okay with you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it is more reliable to go inside than to watch from the shadows. If that can be arranged, I will also be able to save the power divided amongst the &lsquo;Clones&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then it was decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, please do so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Venom was now escorting Masayuki, and Souei would join him there. The question that remained was whether or not to mobilize the army&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In a joint fight with Dwargon, we need to show our military might against the Empire, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The First and Third Corps had already returned home together when the bodies were recovered. In other words, the entire army was staying here, in the capital city of Rimuru. As long as Geld, the head of the Second Corps, was in an evolutionary sleep, the Second Corps could not be moved. In which case&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, I think this is where we come in, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a minute! We should go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aside from Gabil, Gobta was also unusually motivated. But unlike last time, I think it was dangerous to rely on numbers this time. If they had a large army, it was unlikely they would attack us with a large-scale mass attack, but this time, they had a small number of elites. They might use nuclear magic without any hesitation, or they might expose us to more aggressive means of attack. In a magic battle against an army, one normally relied on the strength of legion magic. Before the legion magic was broken, the elite forces attacked each other, but if the opponents were all above a certain level of strength, it was thought that the soldiers on the bottom would only be a hindrance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hakurou, tell me what you think.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hohoho. I understand what Rimuru-sama is thinking. I am sure you are correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words, apprentices are out of the question, and we shouldn&rsquo;t take any low-ranking soldiers with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think we should do so in order to avoid casualties as much as possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess only the Goblin Riders should be the ones to go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From my corps, only the &lsquo;Hiryuu&rsquo; will go out to the battlefield!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had to be that way. Goblin Riders were ranked A in terms of the combined strength of the goblin-wolf duo. They had played the role of decoys very well in this war, and they would not be killed so easily. They were the best at just running away, so it seemed to me that this would not be a problem. I had no complaints with the &lsquo;Hiryuu0. With Gabil&rsquo;s awakening, all of them were now above A rank. I had some concerns about their power control, but I think they would be okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Gobta and Gabil should prepare to go&mdash;no, wait?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was about to give the go ahead, but then I remembered something very important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gobta, can you even call out your star wolf partner right now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I mean, Ranga hasn&rsquo;t finished waking up yet, and I&rsquo;m guessing his family members are still sleeping, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apparently, he couldn&rsquo;t call them out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;B-But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gobta, are you trying to say that you cannot recognize your own strength?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta was looking down with a sigh of sadness, but it couldn&rsquo;t be helped. The superiority of the Goblin Riders was due to the high mobility of the star wolves. Even if each rider was of A-plus rank, we could not take them with us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault. Help Rigur to keep the peace!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, Gobta and the others were not able to go. Then, who else could go out to the battlefield?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is the &lsquo;Kurenai&rsquo; all right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem. All of them have reached A rank.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about. Gobua was an excellent commander, and there were several who had evolved into kijin after receiving the gifts. They should be reliable if they were allowed to participate in the war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What about the &lsquo;Dark Shadows&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They have been dispersed to various places to gather information and search for enemies. If necessary, I will call them back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, they should continue to work behind the scenes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no need to call them all together. It went without saying that information was important, so they should continue as they were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That left the &lsquo;Yomigaeri&rsquo;, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to us! We are always ready and waiting for the opportunity!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmmm, well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">Shion&rsquo;s awakening showed no change. However, the fighting ability of &lsquo;Yomigaeri&rsquo; had increased significantly, and some of them had even reached A rank. The advantage of the &lsquo;Yomigaeri&rsquo; was that they were not prone to death, and I felt that it would be safe to have them participate in the battle</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">but the &lsquo;Yomigaeri&rsquo; did not show their true value unless they were paired with Shion. Without a leader, the &lsquo;Yomigaeri&rsquo; would be acting without a leader. In this case, I decided that it would be safer to leave the &lsquo;Yomigaeri&rsquo; here, just like Gobta and his group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. They should stay at home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Yomigaeri is more of an escort group than an army, and I feel safer if Shion comes with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion easily agreed. With that, we had decided on the units to be deployed. There would be one hundred Hiryuu and three hundred Kurenai. The total number was 400, but all of them were excellent fighters at Over A rank. Although inferior in number, their combat ability was excellent. However, this was still not enough to make me feel secure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, Ultima, Carrera, I have a mission for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it! Anything you say!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the mission, milord?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ultima will continue to accompany Gabil&rsquo;s unit as an intelligence officer. And Carrera, this time, assist Gobua, not Geld.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;lizards again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me. I&rsquo;ll help them out discreetly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was a vaguely unsettling response. Ultima seemed to have developed a bad feeling for Gabil and his crew, and it was hard to believe that Carrera would keep a low profile on her own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh my, Ultima-dono is not happy with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a lot to be upset about all over the place! Should I say that it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re creepy, or that I can&rsquo;t understand you with my common sense&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, do not worry! We will take the battle seriously!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Experimenting with enemy attacks in the middle of a battle, that&rsquo;s not taking things seriously, is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean? It is a good idea to try every possible tactic to gain an advantage in a battle. Experimentation is a part of that and should be taken seriously, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not! That&rsquo;s something that should be done before the battle starts! I mean, why do I have to be giving this lecture?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, it was only natural to have a bad feeling about it. Even as I was listening to this, I felt that Ultima was in the right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but can you bear with him this one time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Rimuru-sama orders me to do so, then I&rsquo;ll do my best. I was thinking that I would have to teach him a lot of things anyway, so this is a good opportunity for me to look on the bright side.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima, who put on an adorable face even with her eyes glazed over, looked at Gabil as if trying to estimate his value and answered me. I guess I could trust her to take care of Gabil, even though they didn&rsquo;t seem to be a good match.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And you, Carrera, you don&rsquo;t have to think about keeping a low profile anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think it&rsquo;s absurd to try to be inconspicuous. Instead, I hope Carrera will try to find the perfect timing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Try to think first and foremost about avoiding damage to your allies. After that, you can just stay quiet until the battle starts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Simple is good!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Really? I reminded her that I would not make any more demands, and that she should be absolutely sure to comply with the ones I had given. I hoped this would help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hakurou, will you accompany Gobua?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave to take Carrera&rsquo;s reins.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou nodded his head with a wry smile. I felt temporarily relieved.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that, we had decided the lineup&mdash;but then, Gadra raised his hand and asked to make a statement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, at the risk of sounding presumptuous, I have a proposition to make.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In my humble opinion, I think that the Demon Colossus should also participate in this war.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see. Taking it out of the labyrinth was a bit of a problem, but even if it broke, no one would be harmed. Even though it was operated by a passenger, Gadra would be able to escape safely. Gadra had the &lsquo;Resurrection Bracelet&rsquo; equipped with the emergency return spell. It was a big advantage for us to be able to observe him safely no matter what kind of fierce battle zone we threw him into. However, would it be a problem to disclose his fighting ability?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Vesta, what do you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I asked Vesta for his opinion, a wry smile appeared on his face. He raised his glasses and opened his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is the perfect place for his unveiling. I have already given a detailed report to King Gazel, and he has been asking to see the real thing for some time now. I would like to receive the data under all circumstances, and it would be interesting for me to know how it would perform on the actual battlefield.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vesta was a researcher after all. The value of a weapon was determined by how powerful it was. Even for the purpose of a demonstration, it was meaningless unless it had been used at least once. Judging from that perspective, this battlefield was a good place for demonstration. Vesta must have thought so. Indeed, the Demon Colossus, unlike weapons of mass destruction, was suitable for local warfare. It would be useful for intimidating the opponent and discouraging their will to fight. Now that I had allowed the three demon girls to go out, it would be wrong for me to reject this offer due to any moral grounds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What if the enemy takes it away from us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I swear I will not make that mistake!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that happens, we will just develop a better golem for next time. There is no end point to technology. That said, if that were to happen, we have installed a self-destruct mechanism, so there is no need to worry about the technology leaking out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wait, wait, wait. He said that as if it was a good thing, but all I could hear was a phrase I couldn&rsquo;t ignore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Self-destruct mechanism?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It was Veldora-sama&rsquo;s idea to include it. I had thought it was some kind of joke, but it&rsquo;s true that Veldora-sama is a master of the arts, so must have anticipated this kind of situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, he didn&rsquo;t. Definitely not. There was no doubt that it was Veldora who made such a stupid suggestion. I guessed that the only people who could ever come up with an idea like a self-destruct mechanism had to be either Ramiris or Veldora&mdash;avid manga readers. Really, I wish people would stop obsessing over such useless things. Still, it was true that it was something better to have than not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay. It&rsquo;s fine if it breaks or falls into enemy hands, but just don&rsquo;t do anything reckless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re cleared to go. Gadra may not get a chance to join, but he&rsquo;s welcome to join us in case of an emergency.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood. I, for my part, have no desire to be rude to a former colleague. If there is a new type of weapon that I do not know about, that is where the Demon Colossus will come in!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that case, I would leave it to him with peace of mind. Gadra had no deep ties to us, so he might betray us if we were on the losing end. Perhaps he wanted to stay out of the labyrinth in case of such a situation. It felt that way, though it was not worth pursuing. I would like to think positively here and try not to make Gadra feel like having second thoughts. In other words, all we had to do was to overwhelmingly win the war against the Empire. Thus, Gadra&rsquo;s participation in the war had been decided along with all the other members who would go.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

As soon as the meeting was dismissed, everyone began to prepare for the next day. As for me, I was going to enjoy a relaxing time in the cafeteria. Tomorrow&rsquo;s schedule would be to start the morning with a moral boost for the departing group. After that, I would send everyone off with the &lsquo;transfer technique&rsquo;. From noon, I would be meeting with Yuuki. Laplace would give me a lift, so I had enough time to spare. It would be a one-day trip, so I didn&rsquo;t need to do much preparation. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t intend to bring any souvenirs for Yuuki, so I could welcome tomorrow with an easy mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure you can just take it easy like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine. What about you? Is it really okay to just leave Momiji and Alvis-san alone?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru had come to the cafeteria with me, but he was a newlywed, so why didn&rsquo;t he just stay at home? I was thinking so, to which Benimaru gave a laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shuna is going to teach them how to cook today. I heard that they made an agreement not to run off on each other, though I got kicked out because of it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hey now, are those really the words of a newlywed? I thought it might be a bad idea, but it wasn&rsquo;t my place to interfere in other people&rsquo;s family affairs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, okay then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded my head in agreement. Diablo came hurriedly to bring us our meals. He looked like a real butler. Well, I&rsquo;ve always wondered whether it was really okay for a primordial demon to do such a thing, but since he was so happy, it was not my place to stop him. I&rsquo;d gotten used to it, so it was too late now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, this is my role as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is that so? Well, there was no problem if he was satisfied with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, please use this too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion poured me a glass of wine. Of course, Shion did not make this wine, so I could drink it with peace of mind, but it still made me feel a bit suffocated. Today&rsquo;s menu was just the familiar pork cutlet, which could be eaten easily without being served this way. And yet, Diablo and Shion were standing behind me, which instead was mentally exhausting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you guys just sit down and eat with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your sentiments are very kind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, no! I&rsquo;m already full, so don&rsquo;t worry about me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;After all, Shion was in the kitchen eating a few morsels!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Diablo, you&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They fought at every opportunity. It was foolish to worry about them, so Benimaru and I decided to leave them alone and enjoy our meal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, are you going to trust Yuuki?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to be honest, but I guess I&rsquo;ll just have to believe. Besides, I want to believe in him too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I will follow Rimuru-sama and will set up all plans on the premise of trusting Yuuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What if they betray us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be good, but there&rsquo;s always a way to make it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m sorry to be troubling you, but please do so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s smile was so encouraging. In war, one could only trust their allies or friends. If even this was in doubt, there would be no maneuver that could succeed. If we were betrayed, the damage would be so great that I would have to make a difficult choice. Still, I have decided to trust Yuuki. Now that I have decided so, there is no point in worrying about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;I was wondering, do you have to eat</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c14">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked Benimaru, who was eating a pork cutlet in front of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I had to answer whether or not it was necessary, I would say no.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I knew it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But Rimuru-sama is the same, right? I&rsquo;m relieved that I haven&rsquo;t lost my sense of taste.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand. When I couldn&rsquo;t even satisfy my three major desires, I honestly thought my life was over. Thanks to my hard work, my appetite and desire for sleep came back, so I am still enjoying every day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure. I was worried about that, too, but I&rsquo;m relieved to see that things are back to normal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We nodded to each other. Then, I suddenly felt something strange.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? You&rsquo;re still in your original state, so you still have all three desires?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Fortunately, all of them were preserved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And sleep?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to sleep, but meditating puts me into a state of sleep. Moreover, I will recover from fatigue if I do so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s with that? I&rsquo;ve been able to sleep only after all my hard work, but he was able to do it from the very beginning? And it&rsquo;s even better than my results! No, what I&rsquo;m more interested in is&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And your libido?&rdquo; I asked in a whisper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru nodded his head in affirmation, looking a little embarrassed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? I thought you couldn&rsquo;t evolve because you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to have children&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Momiji and Alvis are also both pregnant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then congratulations&mdash;no wait, didn&rsquo;t you lose your sexual desire too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought it would disappear, too, but my libido remained even if I couldn&rsquo;t have children. I guess I won&rsquo;t have to give them any grief now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I envy him too much. It&rsquo;s the perfect evolution, with all the features I don&rsquo;t have anymore. Damn it, how did I ever&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks&hellip;why are you stealing my food?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up! You traitor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My jealousy flared up as I snatched Benimaru&rsquo;s pork cutlet away from him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was only natural</span><span class="c14">, I thought to myself. What else was I supposed to do when all I had to look forward to was eating? In any case, we had a good time that night, making a big deal out of things. It was the usual scene as always. However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This daily routine came to an abrupt end.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Velgrynd has appeared in front of the Mixed Corps that is deploying, and he needs your help immediately!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vesta screamed with bloodshot eyes. I got up from my seat at this surprising content.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gather the members who are scheduled to leave as soon as possible!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru moved immediately upon hearing my order. With that, everyone would be here in no time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Laplace, wait a minute before you go back. We&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;B-But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Laplace&rsquo;s panic, I initially suspected it was an act. I thought he was up to something again, trying to trap us. However, when I heard the following report from Vesta, I understood that this was not the case. Something important was happening in the Empire that Laplace did not know about. In times like this, it was important to remain calm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know something big is going on, but don&rsquo;t panic. We&rsquo;re allies now. It&rsquo;s more convenient for you to go back with us rather than to go back alone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Convenient?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the enemy&rsquo;s maximum strength was in front of the Mixed Corps, this could be considered as an opportunity. Yuuki and the others seemed to have been attacked by someone, but if we defeated them, we would be able to proceed with the negotiations in a favorable way. With this in mind, I decided to ask Laplace for more information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what happened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace answered my question after some hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I got a call from Teare. The chairman, Kagali-sama, wants me to come back. Apparently, we are being attacked by Kondou and others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lieutenant Kondou, he seemed to be one of the troublesome ones. I guess it would be a good idea to cooperate with Laplace and take him out. But what was worrying was that Yuuki and his group, with their battle strength, was unable to do anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is Yuuki doing? Did he lose, too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems that Damrada is the boss&rsquo;s opponent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damrada was one of the heads of Cerberus, who was actually the vice commander of the Imperial Guardians. Did he betray Yuuki after all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He made us think he was Yuuki&rsquo;s comrade, but was that not the case? Since I had never met him, I couldn&rsquo;t read into what he was thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Both Teare and Footman often go back and forth. Anyway, it seems that they are fighting against the boss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm, I don&rsquo;t get it. However, what is certain is that there are some nasty enemies scattered about. In any case, the first thing to do is to check the situation. And so, I invoked the physical magic: &lsquo;Argus&rsquo; on the spot to save time. Since I already knew the coordinates, I pinpointed the location of the Mixed Corps garrison. The local situation was projected on the wall of the cafeteria.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Th-This is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wondered who had involuntarily muttered that. A beautiful woman with a glamorous smile. Her distinctive feature was her azure hair tied like a chignon on her head. The woman was wearing a gorgeous Chinese garb and a military uniform draped over her shoulders. She was standing before a huge army of 60,000 men as if she were walking through an uninhabited field. No, not a large army, but rather what used to be a large army. Soaring overhead were presumably the corpses. A crimson pillar connecting heaven and earth&mdash;yes, that was a hyper-gravity force field. Blood rained down, staining the entire force field a bright red.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Gravity Collapse&rsquo;. Good grief, using my best move without my permission!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera spoke lightly, but her expression was serious. And as it should be. The magic used by the supposed Velgrynd was more precise than the one used by Carrera. It was perfectly ranged and controlled without going haywire. The absence of any evidence of destruction suggested that it affected only gravity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did she control gravity and blow up only the army without affecting the earth?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, milord, and the ugly thing is, not a single grain of sand was involved. She only blasted those she deemed as enemies into the sky.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is such a thing even possible? No, I think she is able. As long as the result was right in front of me, I couldn&rsquo;t doubt it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you going to fight that thing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, so that is the sister of Veldora-sama. Interesting. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to fight her seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo was pretty tough, but Velgrynd honestly seemed like an unbeatable opponent.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;No. If you give it your all, you have a chance.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was reassuring, but the problem was that it would take an all-out effort. There would definitely be casualties, so we should avoid fighting if at all possible. In that case, it would be better to go for Emperor Rudra rather than Velgrynd. Let Guy and Rudra settle their dispute and end this war. Then, we could avoid unnecessary sacrifices.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand. Why not just finish the magic?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s because she doesn&rsquo;t like to destroy nature like we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, that shouldn&rsquo;t be it. Look, the bodies that have been drained of blood are all piled up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa pointed to a corner of the image. There were, indeed, many bodies piled up there. I split the screen and zoomed in on the location. There was a man in a military uniform and a woman whom I had seen before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yuuki&rsquo;s secretary&mdash;Kagali-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She is our creator and the president of the Moderate Clown Troupe. Damn it! I didn&rsquo;t want to believe it, but it&rsquo;s true. I just got a message from Footman and Teare that Kagali-sama is being controlled by Kondou.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Controlled? As in Mental Control?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. And worst of all, Teare and Footman cannot resist Kagali-sama. I guess that&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t get the &lsquo;telegram&rsquo; from them earlier, because they were ordered to stop.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That sucks. Mental Control. I think taking away a person&rsquo;s free will is the worst.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;But it was more than that. The current situation was very bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I mean, how far does Kagali-san&rsquo;s domination affect her? Will you be okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace seemed to be seriously frustrated, though it was hard to tell while he was wearing a mask. If Laplace was unable to disobey orders as well as Teare and Footman, that would be a big problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine. Kagali-sama has created me, but I&rsquo;m the only one who does not have to follow orders. What is more problematic is the fact that most of the members Yuuki-san has gathered have &lsquo;curses&rsquo; engraved on them. Of course, the only ones I&rsquo;m worried about are the executives, but the rest of them are in such a state that there&rsquo;s no point in thinking about it now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, Yuuki&rsquo;s army was no more. Even if there were some survivors, they would not be able to escape from that magic. There were still some survivors outside the influence of the magic, but they seemed to have lost their will to fight after seeing the tragedy. They were not going to be a force to be reckoned with, even without the curse engraving. It was good news that Laplace was unaffected because the situation was so bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re okay at least.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. My friends are already done for.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace spoke in the most matter-of-fact way he could. His voice remained calm and unaffected, sounding as if he didn&rsquo;t feel anything, but I didn&rsquo;t think that was the case. He was frustrated and remorseful that his friends were being manipulated. There was no doubt that it was from the heart. Without saying anything, I pat Laplace on the shoulder. Laplace looked at me in surprise. I spoke to Laplace in a cheerful tone as naturally as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s too early to give up, don&rsquo;t you? Kagali-san is not dead. If Kondou is controlling her, she&rsquo;ll go back to normal if we defeat him. Yuuki is probably still fighting, so let&rsquo;s go help him and fight back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was an attempt to comfort him, but that was better than being negative. In any case, we could leave the despair for later. What could be done now? It was important to think about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very noble man, saying the same thing as the boss. If it&rsquo;s human beings who persecuted and exiled us, and it&rsquo;s human beings who are helping us&hellip;it&rsquo;s a match made in heaven.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace muttered and seemed to smile bitterly under his mask. I may look like a human, but I&rsquo;m still a monster&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then again, even if I&rsquo;m a slime, I used to be human. Was it too much to correct those words here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have a question, if ya don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it you want as a demon lord?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s what this is about? Nothing I&rsquo;ve done since the beginning has changed. From the moment I came into this world, I have had only one ambition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to live happily together with everyone. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve built towns, created a country, and communicated with other countries. After that, I want to get along with people who have similar tastes and interests, while respecting diversity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you ever thought about taking over the world?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with that? That would be too much trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Once you have the world, you can do whatever you want!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that would definitely get boring. It is only when there are different ideas and thoughts that there can be a wider range of possibilities. The more possibilities there are, the more fun you can have with your work!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I argued my point, Laplace looked at me with a puzzled look on his face. Then, as if in a panic, he waved his hand and shouted, &lsquo;Wait, wait, wait!&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s crazy! What do you mean by &lsquo;work&rsquo;? We weren&rsquo;t talking about that now. We were talking about what happens after you take over the world!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re the one who doesn&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, you want everything to be your own way. Is that through some kind of thought control for other people? Or are you saying that you prefer to be under mental control like Kagali-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I believe that freedom of thought, speech, and expression should be guaranteed. That is the respect for fundamental human rights, and it will be the driving force for diversity and cultural development.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? That&rsquo;s just going to increase the number of selfish, mouth-breathers. They&rsquo;ll never be able to come to an agreement and solvable problems will become unsolvable. How can you run a country like that?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had a point. The greatest weakness of democracy was in how it divided national interests from personal feelings. But that itself was also part of developing diversity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay. That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll all think about overcoming together. I&rsquo;m essentially a selfish being, so no amount of talking will move this country in a direction I don&rsquo;t want it to go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was fine with being the big-talker. Reign but do not rule. With these words in mind, I would continue to do what I had always done. Fortunately, there were many role models. I could learn from Luminas, who used religion as a cover for her rule, and from Elmesia-san, who used a ruling system that placed her at the top of the country. Well, I still had a long way to go, so there was no need to decide what to do now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, national policies and such are an afterthought. What&rsquo;s more important is the development of culture. Yes, entertainment. Without it, the development of the country is meaningless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the most important part. In order to make life interesting, a lot of entertaining works must be produced. For that reason, there should be no restrictions on thought and expression. Laplace looked at me puzzled as I explained this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. Our family can&rsquo;t understand. He&hellip;the boss, he promised to take over the world and make it a better place to live. That&rsquo;s why I chose to believe in him, in Yuuki-san. But what&rsquo;s wrong with you?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mocking our ambitions with such a lax resolve!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mocking you. I just think that world domination might not be as fun as you think, and it might be harder than you think.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace was silent for a while upon hearing my answer. Then, he spoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;ve known for a long time, this kind of thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace sat on the floor without strength. His face was turned to the magically projected image, and he gazed at the pile of dead bodies with Kagali standing in front of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You asked earlier what they were doing there. I&rsquo;ll tell you. This is the best-kept secret of all. You should know that we&rsquo;re undead elves&hellip;so I&rsquo;ll tell you about how we can increase their number.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmmm? Wait, wait, wait, this sounds really important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calm down. This is not exactly the kind of thing you can talk about in the cafeteria, is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. This is not the time for that. Listen, we were all created by Kagali-sama. That&rsquo;s what the Curse Lord is all about&hellip; creating powerful majin by gathering the dead and their grudges&hellip;a forbidden spell&hellip;the forbidden spell: &lsquo;Dead Birthday&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cafeteria was also a room for executives. There were no civilians in the dining room, but Laplace had a lot of guts. I couldn&rsquo;t believe that he would discuss such a top-secret matter in a place like this. Those who remained were Benimaru, who had returned after giving instructions, Souei Diablo, Shion Hakurou, the three demon girls, and Vesta, who had been watching the video with me after I finished my report. Before I knew it, Gabil had also returned, perhaps after giving instructions to the others. It was an important story, but it was fortunate that no one troublesome heard it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it. What a nostalgic spell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know about it, Diablo?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo was a magic maniac, so it came in handy at times like these. It would be a big help if he knew about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The body I received from Rimuru-sama is also an application of the &lsquo;Dead Birthday&rsquo;. In my case, I did not have a soul, but it was the best body for incarnation. The original purpose of using it is to unite more than 10,000 corpses and make its power one&rsquo;s own.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s true that inhumane, evil, and taboo were the most common words to describe this kind of forbidden spell. Well, I can&rsquo;t say anything as someone who also took souls, so I&rsquo;d leave that alone for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wonder if the &lsquo;make its power one&rsquo;s own&rsquo; means to be possessed by a specific person?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It depends on the situation, but I think it&rsquo;s safe to assume so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Diablo-san is right. Footman, Teare, and Clayman are all surviving members of Kazalim-sama. They lost their homeland, and to remember the humiliation, they turned to the forbidden spell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace agreed. I guess my speculations were correct. That being the case, it would be bad to let the spell be completed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There were about 60,000 Mixed Corps out there. With that much material, they should be able to produce at least ten undead elves that can rival Clayman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, come on&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And the trouble is, there are a lot of strong souls there. Unlike Footman and Teare, they may be able to control more powerful forces.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I asked specifically what that meant, Laplace replied with disgust. This is what he said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Footman and Teare were still immature in spirit because they had been engulfed by the mighty power. When Kazalim had first created the undead elves, he was not mature enough to distribute his soul and power. This was the reason why he had given them more power than they could handle. Clayman had used this mistake to his advantage and had succeeded in creating a successful undead elf.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, that did not mean that Footman and Teare were failures. Their mental immaturity had delayed the growth of their intellects, but they still possessed great power. In fact, even the pre-evolutionary Clayman lagged behind Footman. In that aspect, he was more successful than Clayman in terms of fighting ability alone. If we consider the case of creating an undead elf specialized in strength out of 60,000 corpses, one could say that it would be a greater success story than Clayman. In that case, it would probably be condensed to six to seven persons. If these people were willing to sacrifice an army of a million for the sake of creating an awakened person, they were likely to do such a thing without any trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;We were all just kids then. Teare still is a kid, not to mention Footman. Clayman was the only one who had grown up. Clayman, too, destroyed himself with his idiotic outbursts. However, we don&rsquo;t think of it as your fault. It&rsquo;s the law of the jungle after all. It&rsquo;s only natural to test those we don&rsquo;t trust, and we don&rsquo;t mind sacrificing others in order to expand our power. These are our family&rsquo;s true feelings. Are you still willing to join hands with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clearly, Laplace had dared to say something that didn&rsquo;t need to be said. There was no point in pissing us off here, so it might have even been a bad idea. Still, the fact that Laplace said what he did was a good thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate us. I will never forgive you for inciting the orcs and destroying the ogre village, but since Rimuru-sama has decided to join forces with you, there will be no opposition from us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru is right. My heart breaks just thinking about the regrets of everyone in my village, but even with what was done to everyone, mourning will not make one feel better. I will be able to forget my regrets only when we realize the world that Rimuru-sama desires, a world where everyone can live with laughter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, you may think that you can cut off the root of the scourge by turning everyone&rsquo;s hatred against you, but that is naive. That anger is not so easily erased. It is not such a small thing that can be extinguished just by torturing you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s correct. As you said, this world follows survival of the fittest. The worst thing of all was our own immaturity. You have cried because of your own immaturity as well, haven&rsquo;t you? In that case, you can understand how we feel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru, Shion, Souei, and Hakurou. They had decided to fight together, swallowing their hatred for Laplace and the others in their hearts. It was only natural that they could not forgive Laplace&rsquo;s actions, but they were still trying to overcome them. As I thought at the time of Geld, Benimaru and the others truly had big hearts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look, I haven&rsquo;t forgiven you guys, and I don&rsquo;t fully trust you, but you&rsquo;re my allies now. Let&rsquo;s forget our differences and fight together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;m counting on you. Please, I just want to help the boss and the chairman, so please help me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace bowed his head deeply, with a sincere attitude that was unlike that of the normally aloof man. If even this was acting, then I would never be able to trust anyone else. For the time being, I believed that I could trust him.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

The gesture was so determined and charming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright. So then, the six of us will infiltrate as planned, and go to Yuuki&rsquo;s rescue.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Let&rsquo;s rescue that bastard so he can apologize properly later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was motivated. Well, it was Yuuki after all. I had a feeling that he would take down Damrada and then be calm as usual. The real problem was how to deal with Velgrynd. Just when I was about to give out my instructions, Shion made a surprising remark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This man Kondou is the mastermind, isn&rsquo;t he? Since he is the one who manipulated Kagali and the others, Clayman might have been manipulated too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were all silent. Benimaru was frozen with a surprised look on his face, and Laplace muttered a &lsquo;what?&rsquo; to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufu. The first secretary sure says some interesting things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo tried to laugh it off, but then he seemed to recall all the previous situations and realized that there was no denying Shion&rsquo;s statement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou even said the same thing. No, rather, it was only natural to think so. Laplace had said that Yuuki ordered Clayman to keep quiet. Even if the orc riot was unintentional, the subsequent outburst would have gotten him nowhere.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Notice. The situation was redefined based on the newly obtained information. A portion of individual Clayman&rsquo;s actions were unclear, but if Kondou and others intervened, it makes sense. The conclusion is that the Empire is the one that can gain the most profit.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, that&rsquo;s how it should be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;What does that mean? So we got into trouble because of Kondou&rsquo;s plan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fuck this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being vulgar, Benimaru. Change your ways, or I&rsquo;ll tell Shuna-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that. I&rsquo;ll change it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The exchange between Benimaru and Shion went ignored.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is frustrating, but I guess I have to agree with Shion&rsquo;s opinion. I also did some criminal psychology analysis for profiling, and there were a few unclear points in Clayman&rsquo;s behavior. He seemed to have been in a hurry to move his army when he should have been more careful. I had overlooked it because of his stupidity, but it would make sense if a third party intervened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wow, Diablo&rsquo;s opinion was the same as Wisdom King Raphael-san. Now I had no reason to doubt him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Although we don&rsquo;t know the truth, let&rsquo;s assume that Clayman was also manipulated by Kondou. In other words, when you are in contact with Kondou, make sure to be alert to the possibility that you can be manipulated!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Being careful may not even help, but it was better than nothing. Anyway, this Kondou guy was one to watch out for. If we were not careful, he may even be more troublesome than Velgrynd. I made sure that everyone remembered Kondou&rsquo;s face as a common knowledge. Now then, to summarize the strategy&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gabil and his men will respond to King Gazel&rsquo;s request for help. But do not fight Velgrynd seriously. Even the leaders will be in danger and the soldiers will die for nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, sir. Even I would not challenge a great True Dragon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hohoho, we would be no match.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil and Hakurou understood this well enough. The purpose of the reinforcements was to buy time. After we rescued Yuuki, we would deal with Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But is it okay to leave that ritual alone?&rdquo; Ultima asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By &lsquo;ritual&rsquo;, she meant Kagali&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dead Birthday&rsquo; ceremony.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that. That spell takes a long time to work. It takes at least two hours to produce one. If you try to condense the energy, you will need more time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo said as such. Less than an hour had passed since the ceremony began. If we met up with Yuuki, defeated Emperor Rudra, and then hurried back&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the case. Diablo-san is right according to the original method, but Kagali-sama is bein&rsquo; helped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;Helped</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">Oh my. So that&rsquo;s why Velgrynd-sama is cooperating.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo seemed to have understood, but I was not sure what was going on. Still, we didn&rsquo;t have time to listen to the details here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So then, how much time do we have?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Worst case scenario, a couple of undead elves could be created in two hours.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two hours, huh? Can we defeat Emperor Rudra in just that much time? No, there was no point in worrying. We just had to do it. I looked at Laplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the strongest, right? At the least, you&rsquo;re stronger than Clayman, and you seem to be stronger than the other two guys who specialize in strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I was specially made.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, let&rsquo;s ignore Kagali&rsquo;s spell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that okay?&rdquo; Gabil wondered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Think about it, Gabil. Laplace is pretty strong, but he&rsquo;s not insurmountable. As for the other two, I think you can beat them, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was how I saw it. Laplace hid his power, but my eyes could not be deceived. In other words, I sensed that he had not awakened to his Ultimate Skill. Gabil was tough, but Souei should be able to fight him to a tie. In other words, if an undead elf as strong as Laplace was created, it would be troublesome, but if it was weaker than Laplace, it would be no problem. If it grew, they would be a nuisance that couldn&rsquo;t be left unattended. However, I judged that it was not so much of a threat that we had to immediately interfere with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Velgrynd is assisting with the spell, that&rsquo;s a good thing. If possible, hinder her so that she cannot concentrate. If not, just leave Velgrynd alone. Or rather, we should not actively step on the tiger&rsquo;s tail.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I said so, Gabil and Hakurou looked at each other and nodded. It seemed that they were in agreement. And then, in case of any emergency&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If she turns on you or King Gazel, then Ultima and Carrera will just have to deal with her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were the strongest of my subordinates, and they would buy us some time against Velgrynd. I could ignore Kagali&rsquo;s ritual, but if Velgrynd made a move, the army would be destroyed. To avoid that, I gave a ruthless order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks for relying on me! Even if it&rsquo;s Veldora-sama&rsquo;s sister, I&rsquo;ll show her no mercy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;ll see if we can win if we try. I still have an undefeated record, so I&rsquo;ll enjoy it as much as I can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima and Carrera responded in kind. I would just pretend I never heard about their loss to Zegion. I had finally thought that the plan was decided when something else came up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;One moment, please. It is not enough for Ultima and Carrera to deal with Velgrynd-sama. I know it&rsquo;s rude of me to offer to show you the way, but I too would like to volunteer to take on Velgrynd-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Testarossa&rsquo;s proposal. When I heard this, I felt troubled. The proposal sounded attractive, but if we were to invade the center of the capital, I thought it would be better to attack with our maximum strength. Not only were there powerful opponents whom Guy recognized as strong, there would also be more than four &lsquo;Single Digits&rsquo; as guards. If we were to face such strong opponents, I didn&rsquo;t really want to miss out on Testarossa&rsquo;s battle strength. However, if this would buy time against Velgrynd, it seemed like a good idea. If that was the case, then Gadra would be the best choice&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will accompany you instead. It will save time and increase the success rate of the operation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei&rsquo;s offer was a reasonable one. At the very least, it was better than taking Gadra with us. Benimaru, Shion, Souei, and Diablo. With these four, I don&rsquo;t feel like we would lose to any opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go with that. Then please come with us, Souei.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil and his team&rsquo;s main objective was to buy time. If possible, they would move to eliminate the enemy forces, including Kondou. In case of emergency, Testarossa and the others would come in. This was the best that could be done at this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s settled. Gabil and the others, take it easy until we get back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, the plan was decided in a hurry.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, Vesta, who had been watching the video for a long time, shouted in a hoarse voice, &ldquo;O-oh! King Gazel has arrived on the scene!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing him say so, I turned my eyes to the image and saw the Pegasus Knights soaring in the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry. Join up with Gazel and tell him about the plan before they are harmed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me! I, Gabil, will take on this great responsibility!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, let&rsquo;s get moving!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I gave the order. And so began the long, long night.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I had been in human form from the beginning so that I could be ready for anything that may happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here. This is our secret base&hellip; Hey, where is this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We had come here by magic, but there was something wrong with Laplace. It was at that point that I had a bad sense of foreboding. Looking around, I could see a vast hall that did not exist in our country. It was lined with carved pillars, and a luxurious-looking carpet was spread out. It looked like an audience hall of some imperial castle, though I could not help feeling that there was a distorted sense of space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-No, it&rsquo;s not me! I usually only transport to fixed locations. This has never happened before!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I looked at Laplace impatiently as he answered. It didn&rsquo;t look like he was lying, but if that was the case, what was the meaning of this? I looked around in contemplation and saw a place about fifty meters ahead of us where the ground was elevated with several steps. I could see what looked like a throne, so it appeared to be an audience room. A person of high rank was sitting on a chair, and next to him was a beautiful woman with blue hair. The distinctive chignon was prominent, and Velgrynd herself could not be mistaken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Velgrynd! No, she was in the war zone just now, so she can&rsquo;t really be here, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If they transferred, they could make it in time, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru answered my question. He looked puzzled along with Souei and Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re surrounded. It seems that this was a trap.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Diablo who calmly spoke out. I sensed it too, that there were dozens of people in this hall. They seemed to be quite strong as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Laplace, you bastard. So you really wanted to set us up&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite Souei&rsquo;s sharp tone, Laplace&rsquo;s mind wasn&rsquo;t on it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is ridiculous. Are you saying you interfered with my technique? No way, that&rsquo;s impossible&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, he was completely bewildered. Apparently, Laplace had not seen this coming. In my opinion, Laplace did not set up this trap. A man then approached us, making us more cautious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, nice work Laplace, I&rsquo;m glad you managed to fool Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s group.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Yuuki. He was dressed in an imperial uniform with a smile on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;B-Boss? W-Wait, wait. What&rsquo;s this all about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha. You can stop acting. If we can get rid of Demon Lord Rimuru right now&hellip;we&rsquo;ll win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing Yuuki&rsquo;s comment, Shion and Souei became furious. However, Benimaru and, surprisingly, Diablo also remained calm and listened to the conversation between Yuuki and Laplace. Seeing this, I was impressed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;You guys believe in Laplace, too.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ah, no. I was just thinking of a quick way to kill them when they let their guard down.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Hey!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Kufufufufu, as expected of Benimaru-dono. Kill them before they kill you. It&rsquo;s a fundamental rule.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What kind of mafioso are you trying to be, you idiots! We don&rsquo;t have those fundamental rules in our country! I was so exasperated that I convinced them to just wait and watch. I also calmed down Shion and Souei, who were in a murderous mood. Meanwhile, Yuuki and Laplace&rsquo;s argument was heating up. Laplace was desperately trying to convince us of his innocence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Trust me! I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong this time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki&rsquo;s move was nothing short of brilliant, because the more desperate he got, the more suspicious he became. I felt sorry for Laplace and decided to end this farce. I patted Laplace on the shoulder and spoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calm down. That guy is Yuuki, but he&rsquo;s also not Yuuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Unfortunately, Kondou must be controlling him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Either Damrada defeated him and manipulated him, or he took him by surprise in the middle of the fight. Whatever the case may be, the fact that there was someone who would control the mind of their enemy was a complication. If I didn&rsquo;t really believe in it, I would have been brought into a fight immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, so that&rsquo;s it! I mean, it&rsquo;s fun to fool others, but it&rsquo;s really annoying when it happens to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace had a good personality. He was cheered up now that he knew I believed him. But that didn&rsquo;t make things any better. We were still surrounded, and we were still in a crisis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to see through it so easily. I was hoping to make you more suspicious and let you take it out on your own comrades.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki too, even when being manipulated, was still a bad character. I guess this was just his nature, so I&rsquo;d let it slide with a mature attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your Majesty, I&rsquo;m afraid my mission has failed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was a poor sideshow. But oh well. I also wanted to have a few words with them before we began fighting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Yuuki spoke to the person sitting on the dais, he got up and started walking. Yuuki quietly moved to the side and gave way. I could conclude from this that Yuuki was now a vassal of Emperor Rudra. Although I could not rule out the possibility that this was an act, I could not be too optimistic. Velgrynd followed behind Rudra. With the exception of her beauty, she looked like an ordinary human being, which was obviously hiding the real information. I could see it. Velgrynd had a thin &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; around her body and the man walking in front of her. The Barrier was blocking off all signs of aura.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A great sense of intimidation. I do not believe that this is a fake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree. It&rsquo;s amazing to see up close.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru nodded at my words. However, the others reacted differently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? I have also accompanied Veldora-sama in his training, so I feel the same way. Of course, I cannot win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion&hellip;so you trained with Veldora too? That means actual combat in the labyrinth. It&rsquo;s the same as fighting for your life, so the results were not to be underestimated. However, if we couldn&rsquo;t win, what was the point? It was neither arrogance nor a sigh of defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is indeed a brilliant &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo;. But as Shion says, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be that much different from Veldora-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo&rsquo;s opinion was also similar to Shion&rsquo;s. Was Velgrynd&rsquo;s evaluation too low or was Veldora&rsquo;s evaluation too high? I was also at a loss to decide. However, even the confident Diablo did not assert that Shion could win. This was important. Diablo, surprisingly, did not lie, and he did not say things that he could not do. That was what I understood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know this wasn&rsquo;t on your agenda, but it would be interesting to have an elite meeting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra smiled just like Masayuki. His hair color was a shining blonde, and his hairstyle was slightly different. Rudra&rsquo;s eyes were also blue while Masayuki&rsquo;s eyes were brown. There were many differences between them, but for some reason, I got the same impression that they were one in the same. On that note, Masayuki did say something strange.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">&lsquo;Lately, my hair has been&hellip;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">&lsquo;Balding?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">&lsquo;Yes, yes, I&rsquo;ve been under a lot of stress&mdash;how can that be?! It&rsquo;s just that my hair color has been getting lighter. It was black but now it seems more brownish?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">&lsquo;Hmm. Perhaps you lost melanin pigment, or something like that?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c4">&lsquo;Is that so? Then I won&rsquo;t be too worried about it.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was just a boy with the usual teenage angst. I had thought so, but now, for some reason, it all came to mind. I was honestly curious, but now was not the time to dwell on it. Rudra was walking right in front of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, we weren&rsquo;t planning on this. However, I did want to talk to you about something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Well then, have a seat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra waved his hand and two chairs appeared. Was it a magic trick? I didn&rsquo;t know the principle of it at all, but it didn&rsquo;t seem like a trap or anything. This was the kind of time to just focus on the atmosphere. I sat down without hesitation. Benimaru stood to my right, and Diablo took the left side of the table. Shion quickly stood right behind me, and Souei was right next to her. Laplace, who seemed to be out of place, wandered for a moment and then slid in next to Shion&rsquo;s left. Velgrynd&rsquo;s teasing voice came to us after we had settled in our spots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not very good etiquette to sit down first!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Etiquette? I don&rsquo;t know anything about that. I just sat down when you told me to sit down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, Velgrynd, they didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. As a demon lord, he&rsquo;s in the same position as a leader of a nation. I think we are equals.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His Majesty the Emperor seemed to be speaking from his heart, quite a large vessel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s okay with you, then I don&rsquo;t have a problem with it either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was easily convinced. If she really didn&rsquo;t care, then I wish she could have stopped threatening me. Rudra sat proudly in the chair opposite. Velgrynd sat naturally at his right side. One step behind them were Four Knights armed with mythical-grade weapons. These Four Knights must have been the four that Bernie mentioned. Finally, a man in a black military uniform stood on the left side of Rudra. Since he did not look Japanese, I guessed that he was Damrada. Yuuki was standing next to Damrada, making his position clear. I decided to regard him as an enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That said, all of the top officials of the Empire except for Kondou were present here. We had also brought our top leaders, but we were overwhelmingly outnumbered. On the imperial side, there were dozens of top-ranking Imperial Guardians. Moreover, there were even five &lsquo;Single Digit&rsquo; members of the highest rank. In addition, there was Velgrynd, so it was doubtful that we could ever win. On top of that, there was Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was no exaggeration to say that we were in a crisis like never before. From Rudra&rsquo;s words, it seemed that this situation was not Laplace&rsquo;s fault, but rather had been set up from the beginning. Is it always this unsettling to be at the other party&rsquo;s mercy? I put on a fearless attitude and opened my mouth so as not to let them know how I really felt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did I get it this time? We had considered the possibility that you were expecting us, but I didn&rsquo;t expect the situation to turn out like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was a lie. I had thought we were in a position to take the lead, since we had initially been aiming for a surprise attack with an elite force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, don&rsquo;t be so modest. I didn&rsquo;t expect this either. I had expected that the Armored Corps that I had sent out would be defeated, but I did not calculate that there would be no survivors, and that no one would be awakened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had been, but Diablo had beaten them down. I wouldn&rsquo;t tell him this, but I thought that the person who made that plan was pretty good. That being said, it was an outrageous heresy from a human perspective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And who planned it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked him lightly, assuming he wouldn&rsquo;t tell me anyway. Surprisingly, Rudra happily told me himself. According to him&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The plan had been drawn up by Lieutenant Kondou. I was going to say it was as I expected, but the plan was worse than I had imagined.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c37 lst-kix_list_1-0 start"><li class="c13 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Awaken a few people from the invading army. Then make it look like they&rsquo;ve lost.</span></li><li class="c13 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Intercept the pursuing army with the Mixed Corps. However, since there is a possibility that this corps may betray the enemy, it is to be treated as an enemy force.</span></li><li class="c13 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">When it is confirmed that they have betrayed the enemy, eliminate them together. The &lsquo;Marshal&rsquo; will be in charge of this task.</span></li></ul><p class="c13 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">At this point in the second phase, the plan had gone awry. Kondou seemed to have made a drastic change in his plan:</span></p><p class="c13 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c37 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c13 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Yuuki&rsquo;s faction, which had been kept in hiding, was to be intercepted. From the information he had obtained from Demon Lord Clayman, Kondou concluded that Yuuki and his group had definitely betrayed them.</span></li><li class="c13 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Defeat Yuuki&rsquo;s group. Confirm what he was scheming and make final adjustments based on that.</span></li><li class="c13 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">The number of Mixed Corps gathered is about 60,000. They will be used as sacrifices to mass-produce majin.</span></li><li class="c13 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">At this time, the &lsquo;Marshal&rsquo; will go out to the battlefield and make a showy performance to attract the attention of the Guy and his men.</span></li><li class="c13 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Gather the troublesome ones and beat them at once. For this purpose, the forces should be concentrated in one point.</span></li><li class="c13 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">The advantage of a flashy move is that the Imperial City will look thin. There will surely be attackers, and they will surely be elite. We should hit them with our maximum force.</span></li><li class="c13 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Most importantly, it can be assumed that the monster kingdom is also thin, so we should attack with our maximum force, the &lsquo;Marshal&rsquo;. While Guy&rsquo;s eyes are looking in the other direction, we must capture the most powerful piece, the &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo;.</span></li></ul><p class="c13"><span class="c1">That was the entire plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that he had been getting information from Demon Lord Clayman was a sure sign that Clayman had also been under Kondou&rsquo;s control. This clarified what was once only a suspicion. However, that was not the important point. I was surprised that he had disclosed so much information, but I would leave that aside. There was a more important point in what was just said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">A shiver ran down my spine. H-hey, wait a minute. Just how many Marshals&mdash;</span><span class="c4">or Velgrynd&rsquo;s</span><span class="c14">&mdash;were in that plan? It seems that she was in more than one place at a time. I had been thinking it was strange, but Velgrynd should have been rampaging in the Eastern cities of the Dwarven Kingdom, the current battlefield, by now. So then, who the hell is this person in front of me?</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Ah! There is a power of an Ultimate Skill that allows one to create a being identical to yourself. That is&hellip;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4">&hellip;</span><span class="c14">&lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was the one who spoke out Wisdom King Raphael-san&rsquo;s thoughts, hoping that I was wrong. But the reality was very ruthless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, so you knew. You&rsquo;re so smart.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s smile was so beautiful and so terrifying. The more one wanted something to go wrong, the more those bad premonitions would come true. We can&rsquo;t win, you know! That&rsquo;s just how I felt. No wonder Testarossa had said she couldn&rsquo;t win by herself. I had been keeping my composure because I had thought I could call Veldora to even the game. Now, however, I realized that I could no longer say such a thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Wisdom King Raphael-san, &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; was a very dangerous power. Thinking about it simply, it did not seem to be much different from the &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; which Souei was good at. In Souei&rsquo;s case, he could control multiple &lsquo;Clones&rsquo; at the same time. The &lsquo;Clones&rsquo; were indistinguishable from the main body, and it did not matter how many &lsquo;Clones&rsquo; were destroyed, as long as the main body was safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another foul feature was that the &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; could be split again and again as long as the &lsquo;mana&rsquo; was not exhausted. After all, there was no difference in the physical ability between the main body and the &lsquo;Clones&rsquo;, so it was as if there were multiple Souei&rsquo;s. However, I would reveal something here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; was a tricky thing to control at the same time. It was not a splitting of the consciousness, but rather a &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; that eliminated the time difference between the two. By adjusting the reaction through &lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo;, it only looks like they are moving at the same time without any discomfort. The reason why I didn&rsquo;t use &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; so often was that it was a rather difficult trick. In other words, Souei was a master of the art and had extraordinary senses. I, an amateur, could handle it so well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there was one more thing. Although &lsquo;Clones&rsquo; were equal in physical ability, mana was ontological. Therefore, there was a disadvantage in that they could not use all the skills one possessed. This was the reason why Souei&rsquo;s &lsquo;Clones&rsquo; only used the skills with less mana. Therefore, by mastering this condition well, one can discern which one is the main body of the clone. The characteristic of this Skill was that it was not invincible, since the &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; would disappear when the main body was defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the following was a very important point. Velgrynd&rsquo;s use of &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; allowed one to completely split one&rsquo;s consciousness. It could be thought of as the simultaneous existence of multiple entities. In other words, this was a &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo;, and even if it was defeated, if any one of the &lsquo;Split Bodies&rsquo; remained, they could then become the main body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, there was no need to split the mana. It was as if all &lsquo;Split Bodies&rsquo; were connected to the main body, so they could replenish each other&rsquo;s mana as much as they wanted. That said, since there was a limit to the maximum amount of mana, the total mana of the other &lsquo;Split Bodies&rsquo; including the main body was also reduced by the mana divided. This may be the key to a strategy, but the opponent was a &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo;, which was a race famous for their huge magicule counts. I should have realized that it would be meaningless to use up magicules halfheartedly, since the recovery rate was faster than the consumption rate. To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t know how to beat them. Although I was not Testarossa, I was now being tempted to assert that &lsquo;it&rsquo;s impossible to win&rsquo;. I looked back at Velgrynd and dared to smile arrogantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, thank you. I have a great partner. And when it comes to strategy, I won&rsquo;t lose. So, it seems that you think you&rsquo;re leading us into a trap, but can you tell us what you&rsquo;re after?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In times like these, bluffing was the only way to go. I would show them that I saw through their attempts, and proceed as usual. If I could make them upset and put them on their guard, it would be a win-win situation. However, it did not work out that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How arrogant. You&rsquo;re just like my foolish brother, never admitting defeat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By &lsquo;foolish brother&rsquo;, she was referring to Veldora. With a sister like this, Veldora must have had a hard time. Do you understand Rimuru?&mdash;I thought I heard someone say that, but Rudra opened his mouth, so I turned my attention to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Our objective. If you are confident of your intelligence, there&rsquo;s no need to tell you what that is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if you say that, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m at a bit of a loss. If they wanted to get rid of us, they&rsquo;d have done it by now. But the fact that we were having this meeting meant that there was room for negotiation. I think the answer we&rsquo;d get was that they were trying to bribe us.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. Yes. Thinking in that direction is correct. However, there is a possibility that they are stalling for time, in which case, it is assumed that they intend to defeat the individual Veldora Tempest, and welcome him into their side.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not so bad either. I was half right. Indeed, in Kondou&rsquo;s plan, the &lsquo;Marshal&rsquo; Velgrynd had been planning to take Veldora into possession. I had been listening to it because I thought it was impossible, but if there was &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;, wouldn&rsquo;t Velgrynd be heading for the labyrinth right now? Curious, I contacted Veldora via the &lsquo;Soul Corridor&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Hey&hellip;how are you?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Idiot, this is not the time! We&rsquo;re in big trouble! Sister&hellip;my sister is coming after me. She is currently outside the labyrinth, but if things continue like this, she&rsquo;ll invade!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seemed to be in the middle of a rave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Are you gonna be okay?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I have no choice but to go out myself. It&rsquo;s better than being attacked inside the labyrinth.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora would not be defeated by &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;. I thought as such and gave Veldora permission to fight with all his might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I will take full responsibility, so I want you to take care of Velgrynd. Can I ask this of you?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Is that all? If that&rsquo;s the case, then just leave it to me! Kuahhahahaha!!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;You got it!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt relieved and ended the call. Handing it over to Veldora would be reassuring. I grasped what Rudra was planning. Negotiations resumed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your objective is to win us over. And one more thing. You&rsquo;re meeting with us to stall for time so that we don&rsquo;t interfere with your fight against Veldora, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I answered with a smug look on my face as if to say, &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; Velgrynd looked a little surprised. Then, Rudra smiled happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a delightful guy. It would be fun to let him compare wits with Tatsuya, but I don&rsquo;t have time to be amused at the moment. If you understand me that well, then we&rsquo;ll talk soon. Come be under my command. I will guarantee that your territory remains untouched and give you the status of Grand Duke.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rudra! Appointing an unrelated person as Grand Duke will cause resentment from the other nobles, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. If he&rsquo;s willing to cooperate with me, it will be worth it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rank above a duke, that was the Grand Duke. Normally, it was a position that only an Emperor&rsquo;s bloodline may or may not be able to hold for one generation, yet Rudra had promised to offer it. From an Imperial point of view, this was an unprecedented favor. I heard that they never allowed the warring nations to surrender, and never even allowed them to be annexed in order to increase their territory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An Empire that had always expanded their territory through wars of aggression had offered me the highest position in the world. I think it was safe to say that the Empire thought higher of me than I thought. However, even so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, my answer had long since been determined.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can understand that it&rsquo;s a great offer, but the answer is &lsquo;no&rsquo;. Instead, I have a proposal. Why don&rsquo;t we just call it quits and make peace here? I am not asking for compensation or anything like that, but I&rsquo;d like you to conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was nothing but a suicidal desire to give a hand to those who didn&rsquo;t care about how many sacrifices would be made by those who served them. Having such naive thinking that one might be an exception was a straight path to ruin. Therefore, I refused Rudra&rsquo;s offer. But more importantly&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took this opportunity to express my request. As far as I was concerned, no damage had been done, so I wasn&rsquo;t going to ask for an apology. I was willing to let this invasion go as long as they promised not to bother us anymore. I know some people would complain about it, but I thought it would be best if this could be settled without any more bloodshed. I know I am naive, and I understand that promises are unreliable. As long as the other party was untrustworthy, they would break the treaty at some point. But the important thing was to buy time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By making peace here, we could give each other time to get to know each other. There was a hope that time to deepen mutual understanding would lead to a future in which war could be avoided. If we continued the war in this way, we would only end up where we were currently going. If that was the case, I wanted to take a chance on a small possibility. However, Rudra&rsquo;s answer was cynical.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;After all, you are not meant to be a ruler. You do not understand my mercy, and continue to spin nonsense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How arrogant. Rudra just made the biggest concession and you passed it by!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had lost an army of a million, but his manner was still that of someone superior. Deep down, he did not actually believe that he had been defeated. He considered the lives of the soldiers lost by his orders as no great loss to him. Rudra was very frightening to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I believe that human beings are creatures that can understand each other. I believe that we can eventually unite into one will and create a better world. For this purpose, it is essential to unify the world by overwhelming force.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra&rsquo;s words sounded similar to the ideals I spoke of. And yet, there was a huge gap that could not be filled. It was very frustrating. The fact that he had come to the opposite conclusion from mine, even though we had started from the same starting point, was proof of this. I was expecting him to be more of an idealist, but that was not the case. Rudra was an autocrat who insisted that his own self-righteousness was absolute justice, with a dictatorial mindset that would not accept any ideas from others. Sure enough, he and I were incompatible. If our arguments were this far apart, it would be impossible to find a solution through discussion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We are creatures of free will. There is no such thing as an unchanging justice in the world, and there are many different ways of thinking, aren&rsquo;t there? To refuse to accept that is simply to sow the seeds of conflict.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Foolish. Only my idea is supreme and just. You must know that you will never reach the ideal world if you continue catering to the selfish whims of fools.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No matter who it is, there will always be times to make mistakes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will not deny it. I, too, listen to the voices of my trusted advisors. But it is impossible to hear all the voices of the people. Such an action would only bring disaster to the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, that may be true, however&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt like I could lose in an argument. As much as I hated to admit it, Rudra was much older than me as a ruler.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, there&rsquo;s no point in arguing here. What I want is your loyalty. Demon Lord Rimuru, give up on Guy and join me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Recruitment, once again. They&rsquo;re really planning to take on Guy, aren&rsquo;t they? If I chose Rudra here, it would tip the balance, that&rsquo;s for sure. That is why we were being kept alive. But my answer was still the same as before. Now that the negotiations had broken down, it seemed that a fight was inevitable. Velgrynd, perhaps reading my thoughts, smiled coldly and waved her index finger gracefully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Twice gently. And then, an image appeared in the empty space. It was the same principle as my Argus. The image showed the current battlefield. The image on the screen was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera were lying on the ground before Velgrynd. It was an astonishing sight. Those three girls, who could be considered one of the best fighting forces in our nation, had been defeated by a single being.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; I muttered to myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the video, Testarossa and the others were standing up again. They seemed to have not lost their fighting spirit yet, but they were still struggling against an insurmountable difference in strength. They can&rsquo;t hold out much longer, I had to admit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The primordials you rely on are in such a state before me. Think carefully. I&rsquo;m going easy on you, as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re smart enough to understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I knew it was a threat, even if she didn&rsquo;t say so. If Velgrynd wanted to, the others would not be safe either, except for the three demon girls. I didn&rsquo;t know whose intention it was, but Rudra and the others had made the utmost concession to us. After all, Gabil and the others had no time to help the three demon girls. Before they knew it, airships had appeared in the sky over the battlefield, from which the Imperial Army forces had entered the war one after another. On the ground, too, Kondou&rsquo;s forces were present. Yuuki&rsquo;s former comrades, except for Kagali performing the ceremony, were fighting against the army of dwarves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Teare! And Footman, too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace&rsquo;s shout made me realize that even those nasty masked majins were on the enemy side. It was a close battle, but the situation did not look good. The situation was bad. Benimaru was also worried about me, I could sense it. However, I could not give in at this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re trying to do. It will be easier to get Veldora to join you if you can get me to go along with it. That guy is a free spirit, and he never obeys the orders of his superiors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although, he listens to me pretty well. He gets angry a lot though, so maybe he&rsquo;s just not very good at dealing with me. In any case, that was probably why they wanted me to join. And so, I decided to reject Rudra&rsquo;s invitation. Then, I tried to find another way to look for other compromises&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We do not wish to negotiate. Take it or leave it. Be clear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">I was suddenly confronted with a choice. If I refused, we would be plunged into a battle in which I had little chance of winning. If I accepted, however, I would be thrown into a battle I did not want to fight.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">That is, I would be following the will of others instead of my own, which may end up resulting in greater sacrifice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You talk about uniting into one will and creating a better world, but is that a world where everyone can live with a smile on their face?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if there is no war, even if there is no starvation, if we are deprived of our free will, what&rsquo;s the point of living? What you are trying to do is to deprive people of their potential! Have you really thought about this properly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Potential? We don&rsquo;t need that kind of thing. If we allow people to be free, they will only go down the path to extinction. It is an act not only against my thoughts, but also against Guy&rsquo;s wish. In that case, isn&rsquo;t it only natural that we need someone to control others so that they do not deviate from the right path?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can understand to a certain extent, and I don&rsquo;t deny it. But is that a world where you can smile?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What I want to do, in the grand scheme of things, is also to try and manage the human race. But to a certain extent, I also believe that things should be left to the will of man. Overprotection deprives people of the opportunity to grow. I believe that people are stronger than we think, and we don&rsquo;t need to control them from beginning to end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Smile? How naive. Whatever the sacrifice, it must be done for the sake of lasting peace. There is no need to ask permission to guide those who do not understand. For the sake of the great happiness to come, some patience will be necessary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not that he wasn&rsquo;t understandable, but that he was incompatible with me. What Rudra was trying to do was not looking at the individual. No matter how I thought about it, it seemed to go against my principles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I knew it. Following you will be impossible. I feel that what you&rsquo;re trying to do will only spread more misery. I can&rsquo;t allow you to do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You will be a fool if you do not take the hand I extend to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then being a fool is fine. Why did you become king? To look like a big shot? Or did you just want to live in luxury?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What nonsense. Of course it was for the good of the people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar! I also consider myself a demon lord for the good of all, but I want more people to smile and live. There will be sacrifices, but I&rsquo;m taking pains to make them as few as possible. I can&rsquo;t think like you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wanted to make the world a better place without any sacrifice, but that was impossible. In the first place, when I became a demon lord, I had sacrificed many people. From my point of view, the other side got what they deserved, and I had no regrets, but the victims&rsquo; relatives would probably not be satisfied with such an explanation. That was the crime that I would have to bear. Likewise, Rudra should be guilty of a sin that should not be taken lightly. Upon hearing my words, Rudra looked at me with a fiery gaze for a moment. But then, he regained his composure immediately and looked at me while muttering to himself, &lsquo;He is young and naive.&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rudra?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Velgrynd. It&rsquo;s really been a long time since I&rsquo;ve been fervent. I failed to persuade him, but I am convinced that he is too good to be destroyed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bad habit, Rudra. Yuuki is there too&hellip; I just don&rsquo;t understand your collection addiction!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about us like we&rsquo;re toys,&rdquo;&mdash;I wanted to complain, but decided not to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, now that the negotiations had broken down, it was time to prepare for a fight. As I looked around, all of my companions looked ready to go. They seemed to be doing their preparations while I had been speaking with Rudra. I would defeat Rudra here. I was about to open my mouth, having made up my mind. However:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s truly a pity that we failed to persuade Demon Lord Rimuru. And that kid, he&rsquo;s been getting stronger. I was going to punish him a little for not listening to me. But if I&rsquo;m maintaining &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m going to give it my all for the first time in a long time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? He couldn&rsquo;t be convinced?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t even listen to me. Well, that&rsquo;s also just like his character.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unintentionally, I couldn&rsquo;t help but turn my attention to Velgrynd. Veldora was on my mind. I didn&rsquo;t think the invincible &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo; could be defeated, but his opponent was also an unimaginable monster. I was suddenly worried because anything could happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re worried about that kid? Then I hope you&rsquo;ll take Rudra&rsquo;s hand. If that&rsquo;s the case, I won&rsquo;t have to torment my cute little brother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd brought up another image. It showed a wounded Veldora fighting against her in dragon form</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning to ask you, how did you manage to tame that one?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking how you got Veldora to obey you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, he doesn&rsquo;t obey me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Veldora and I are friends. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So then you&rsquo;re not going to tell me. That&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd exhaled, looking genuinely disappointed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, I&rsquo;ll show no mercy. That boy, the only thing he has above me is the amount of magicules.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as she said that, Velgrynd disappeared. I was surprised and upset. I knew that Rudra and the others were trying to buy time to defeat and tame Veldora. I understood that, and we were just going along with them because we were also trying to buy time. Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; was nearly invincible, but it had its drawbacks. That was the depletion of energy. By eliminating them one by one, you could deplete the divided magicules. Since magicules do not recover immediately, it was possible to weaken the opponent in general.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the number of divided magicules was small, the user could not perform big moves. Therefore, I thought that Veldora would have an advantage. Judging from the video, Veldora did not seem to be able to defeat Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; alone. On the contrary, through &lsquo;Soul Corridor&rsquo;, Veldora&rsquo;s impatience could be felt. On the screen floating in the air, Velgrynd, who had been fighting against Testarossa and the others, disappeared. The three demon girls had been trying their best to stall for time, but it all ended in vain. I knew that this was a bad thing. Velgrynd&rsquo;s power was beyond my expectation. She had seen through our intentions and used them in a mocking way&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you mind? Well, I&rsquo;ll give you one more chance after this battle is over. You&rsquo;ll change your mind once you see how foolish you are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra&rsquo;s voice sounded distant. I felt sorry, but there was nothing I could do about it now. Now that Velgrynd was gone, perhaps it was time to take Rudra down, but for some reason I have a bad feeling about that. And so, I decided to watch Veldora&rsquo;s battle to the end.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the second image screen Velgrynd left behind, a crimson dragon roared. The clash of the century between the &lsquo;True Dragons&rsquo; would only intensify.</span></p><p class="c17" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image25.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c19" id="h.2q88xrht2tcz"><span class="c10">Epilogue</span></h2><p class="c35"><span class="c20 c14">Rage</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">It was a scene that could only be described as a monster Armageddon. No, that was no joke. Because it could only be described that way. Two dragons were fighting in a fierce battle. Although not the same shape, they were both the same size.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Scorch Dragon&rsquo; Velgrynd&rsquo;s true nature was a very refined and beautiful form. It was more agile than Veldora, and its silhouette seemed to be suitable for flying in the sky. I wondered what kind of battle would be fought&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though it was late at night, the sky was unusually bright. The Great Jura Forest was all ablaze, the curtain of night reflecting a hazy red. The capital &lsquo;Rimuru&rsquo; had been evacuated inside the labyrinth, so it was not damaged, but if it had been left outside, it would have been obliterated without a trace. As proof of this, the great gate connecting the labyrinth to the outside world was also destroyed. Most likely, the upper floors of the labyrinth were devastated. The battle had reached a stalemate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd had to cancel the &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;. It was difficult to realize based on the devastation of the forest, but the forces of the two sides were actually well-controlled. Despite the fact that this was a clash of extreme energies, it was a very sophisticated battle. In terms of speed, the two were evenly matched. Veldora had also grown remarkably well, and his highly controlled powers enabled him to fly at very high speeds. He was holding his own against Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that Veldora had been training secretly, and the results were evident. From what I could see, Veldora was slightly ahead of Velgrynd. If we compared only the total amount of magicules, Veldora was superior. The amount of power had increased since his time of being sealed, and he had also acquired some Skills. This was the reason for the result. Even so, I could not shake off my anxiety. Because Velgrynd still had the advantage when it came to mana control. Now that Velgrynd was concentrating on Veldora, the battle was just beginning. Even so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra&rsquo;s calm demeanor was worrisome. How could he be so calm without Velgrynd, who was supposed to be his absolute shield? In my case, the fact that I could call Veldora at any time had been my source of comfort. I knew that I could overcome any crisis situation with Veldora. Rudra was certainly strong. He was a person whom Guy acknowledged, and his domination of Yuuki was also a threat. However, I also still had an Ultimate Skill. And as I had done with Benimaru, there was still a secret technique to give power to others under my control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be honest, the Imperial Guardians were not a threat to us. Only five members of the &lsquo;Single Digits&rsquo; and Yuuki, who were the highest ranks, were the ones we had to be wary of. Damrada especially seemed dangerous&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, I didn&rsquo;t think he would be impossible to defeat. Even if Laplace was not counted in our strength, it seemed that we would be able to fight to our advantage. That was my opinion, but that only made me even more worried. I wondered why Rudra was so calm. Did he think that he had an overwhelming advantage even without relying on Velgrynd? But still, there was no reason to take that risk here. What made him so confident?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was also of interest to me, but I was also curious about how the battle between Veldora and the others was turning out. Velgrynd launched a flame attack, which Veldora blocked with his Barrier. Then, Veldora fired a storm attack in return, but Velgrynd avoided it. It was a tremendous battle. Even I shuddered as I watched it, as if it were a mythological battle. I had never seen Veldora fight seriously before, but it was more than I expected. I never thought that Veldora could go toe-to-toe with Velgrynd, who had overwhelmed Testarossa and the others. But it was also not too surprising when you thought about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora had mastered his Ultimate Skill, &lsquo;Investigation King Faust&rsquo;. That is why he was able to compete with Velgrynd. In terms of skill-level, Velgrynd was superior. However, Veldora&rsquo;s &lsquo;Investigation King Faust&rsquo; was a cheat-level ability. Wisdom King Raphael-san told me that his power was &lsquo;Probability Manipulation&rsquo;. He also had &lsquo;Investigation of Truth&rsquo;, which was the highest authority of the analysis system. With this, it was possible to recognize the enemy&rsquo;s power immediately and to take appropriate measures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was even a little confusing. What was the point of combat-specialization in that case? Truth be told, I was wondering who could beat Veldora who could use his &lsquo;Investigation King Faust&rsquo;. That is why I firmly believed in Veldora&rsquo;s victory. Even now, an invisible attack had been unleashed on Velgrynd. It was impossible to discern from the images, but it looked as if Velgrynd had suddenly been damaged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I knew. This was one of Veldora&rsquo;s special moves, called &lsquo;Storm Blast&rsquo;. He had boasted about it a lot, but now that I actually saw it, I was impressed. At a glance, Veldora released multiple types of waves that seemed meaningless, and then made them intersect at expected coordinates. This was the point where the effect finally came into play. By the time one realized it, it would already be too late. After all, if you have already been hit, there is no way to avoid or defend against it. Well, he seems to have developed a crazy technique.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each wave seemed to have no meaning, which was why they were subconsciously ignored. If one didn&rsquo;t know it, they would definitely be hit, and it was a deadly attack. Velgrynd was also hit by a direct attack of Storm Blast. Veldora was fighting masterfully and I felt relieved. However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just when I was sure that Veldora would win, things began to change rapidly. And then things took a turn for the worse&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, a flying ship appeared in the combat airspace. A man in a different military uniform stood at the bow of the ship. It was Lieutenant Kondou. I turned my eyes to the other image in a hurry, but Kondou and his crew were not there anymore. The ritual had ended when Velgrynd had released &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;. I had lost my composure to the extent that I did not notice it.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">&laquo;Re</span><span class="c14 c39">port. Forbidden spell Dead Birthday completed approximately one minute ago.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only a minute, however, it was still a whole minute. In that time, Kondou had come to the area where Veldora and Velgrynd were fighting. I had a bad feeling about this. Not knowing what they were up to made my heart beat faster than it should. At that moment, another figure appeared on the bow of the airship. He looked exactly the same as the man who was sitting in front of me right now. Masayuki&hellip;? No, not that!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Parallel Existence?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time I realized it, it was too late. What happened next occurred in the blink of an eye, before I could do anything to stop it. Kondou shot Veldora with the pistol in his right hand. There was no way that a bullet would work against Veldora, a &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo; which was the strongest race in the world. Yet before such a thought could even flash through my mind, the bullet pierced Veldora at an unbelievable speed. It exceeded the speed of sound and reached sub-light speed. The bullet pierced Veldora&rsquo;s body, but did not penetrate. And then, it released the evil power. Veldora began to suffer pain. Normally, his wounds would recover immediately, but this moment was fatal. Rudra, in the image screen, held out his hand towards Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let me tell you something. This is called the Regalia Dominion. An absolute power over all who possess a will. Not even the True Dragon race can escape my dominion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as he said this, Rudra stood up from his seat. He was about to leave, as if he had achieved his goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, wait&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, I thought we had an agreement. I&rsquo;m no longer interested in you, but if you decide to join me, I will show you a new world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra didn&rsquo;t care about me. And it seemed that the Rudra here was an imposter created by Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;. They shared the same consciousness, but it meant that defeating him was meaningless. From the beginning to the end, I had been rolling in the palm of Rudra&rsquo;s hand. It was my complete defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate Veldora.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I said so, feeling like a sore loser. Rudra told me a cruel fact, uncaring about what was going on in my mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As expected of the True Dragon. It took me longer than I thought to get a grip on him, but he is finally under my complete control!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra was telling the truth. Soon after, I felt a pain in my chest. A pain so intense that even my Pain Nullification was ineffective. It was as if something was trying to pull my very soul out of me.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Notice. Master and the individual Veldora&rsquo;s &lsquo;Soul Corridor&rsquo; has been destroyed. This means that the &lsquo;Storm Dragon Summon&rsquo; and &lsquo;Storm Dragon Restoration&rsquo; abilities of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Storm King Veldora&rsquo; will no longer be available.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was appalled at being told the cause of the pain. What? Taking Veldora from me? To take&hellip;Veldora&hellip;from me&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke around, damn it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14">I shouted and lashed out at Rudra. Godspeed</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c14">the fastest I could go right now. But Rudra didn&rsquo;t even try to avoid me. He didn&rsquo;t have to. My fist sailed through the air. Rudra had deactivated &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;, and eliminated the now-useless Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s your answer? Well, what a shame. I&rsquo;d have liked to have you under my command, but it seems that won&rsquo;t be the case. My ability is not all-powerful, so I&rsquo;m afraid it will be hard to &lsquo;dominate&rsquo; again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In exchange for quality time, I will give you a little more time to think. In any case, you were trapped the moment we called you to this place known as the fortress of dreams. Let us hope that you will voluntarily surrender.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With these words, Rudra disappeared. As if on cue, Rudra&rsquo;s men also &lsquo;transferred&rsquo; away. I was unable to pursue them, feeling a fierce sense of loss and intense rage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fuck with me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was all the result of my own carelessness. I had meant to take them by surprise, but instead I fell into their trap. I had been wary of Laplace, but my opponent had already anticipated that, and had devised an insidious scheme. As Rudra&rsquo;s words suggested, they had been aware of this as soon as we had entered this place. This distorted and isolated space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just getting out of here would have been enough, but there should always be something I could do. Such thoughts must have led me to be careless without knowing it. I had thought I was being careful&hellip;but the enemy was just one step ahead of me. This was a war. I couldn&rsquo;t win every time. I knew that without being told.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I screamed and punched myself in the face. No pain. Only the pain in my heart, which was tearing apart and becoming even more intense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please stop, Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion&rsquo;s words fell on deaf ears. A second hit, a third.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just when I was about to strike a fourth time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion, who was standing behind me, stopped me. Not just Shion, but Benimaru, Souei, and Diablo had all rushed to hold me down in a panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry. My head was spinning and I got a little carried away. Impatience is a bad habit of mine. Thanks to you guys I was able to regain my composure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was lying. Rising up one by one, rage poured out of me. Still, I stood up, forcing myself to calm my raging thoughts. Even after indulging my anger and beating myself as hard as I could, my face remained clean. Before even Shion and Benimaru could react, Wisdom King Raphael-san had activated self-defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was reminded once again that everyone was watching over me. That is why I just couldn&rsquo;t forgive myself. To make up for this sense of loss, I was filled with an unceasing torrent of rage. I didn&rsquo;t know where to direct this anger. Ah, I remember now. This was a war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that case, it would be wrong to show mercy. So I, too, would do everything in my power to fight the enemy. Was this taking my anger out on them? Perhaps. But so what? The Empire pissed me off. If this is what they desired, then I would give it to them. A blessing in the name of destruction. Those fools had touched my reverse scale. I allowed my rage to unleash the power I had always suppressed.</span></p><p class="c17" id="h.4d34og8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image15.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1126.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c19" id="h.sroj67tc67xu"><span class="c10">Afterword</span></h2><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Long time no see, Fuse here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I got the flu at the end of last year and my body was going through a lot.
