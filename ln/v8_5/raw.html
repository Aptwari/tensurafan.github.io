class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c3">! <br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Right now, I&rsquo;m under Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s punishment. It&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;Psychidae Hell&rdquo;, being tied up by wires and hung under the ceiling. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Despite how it sounds, there isn&rsquo;t any pain or suffering involved. Right now, I am able to relax my body and stay in a relatively free state. This is surprisingly comfortable. And since the wires are flexible, my body can in fact move. However, the wires won&rsquo;t break regardless of how hard I struggle, and all I achieved by moving so much is causing myself nausea. So, I&rsquo;ve come to realize that it&rsquo;s perhaps better to just stay still and be quiet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">My mind now focuses on something far more heart-breaking than the fact that I&rsquo;m all alone here. Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and the others went to the Night </span><span class="c3 c14">something</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;club without me! This is taking things too far. I wanted to go as well&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Instead, I really have nothing to do now&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I suppose it&rsquo;s rather impossible for me to escape by myself, my only hope is to summon one of the direwolf </span><span class="c3">buddies</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to save me. But, how is it possible for me to do that? Not even Captain Rigur can pull it off. I really shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry though, because if I was left like this it must be simple to do. This is probably Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&rsquo;s clever challenge. He is so mean though, I only overslept a little&hellip; But I&rsquo;ll probably make Captain Rigur and Chief Rigurdo mad by saying such things. This better not get out to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Although I complain, there isn&rsquo;t really any pain or displeasure, aside from being bored out of my mind. At the end of the day, Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;is still very kind and gentle. I suppose that&rsquo;s why everyone adores him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Mah, he will probably let me get down by tomorrow when he returns, I just have to endure for the night.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">This is really strange. <br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A whole night has already passed and it&rsquo;s morning now, yet Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;and the others haven&rsquo;t returned. Did something happen? Maybe they are just going sight-seeing or are spending the night somewhere else. But honestly, I&rsquo;m beginning to feel hungry. I really hope to be back home soon.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"><br></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">This is really bad&hellip;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s been three days yet Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;and the others still haven&rsquo;t returned. That&rsquo;s worrying, but&mdash;right now I&rsquo;ve got no time to worry about others!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Right now, I am facing a real crisis. Even though it&rsquo;s pretty terrible to have an empty stomach, a far more pressing issue has come up.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">piii ~~~~~~ guruguruguru&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">My stomach hurts&hellip; I was able to keep the pee in, but now I&rsquo;m faced with a number two. While under attack from both, I feel as though my psyche is being trained to the extreme.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Also&mdash;Ahh! Right now I&rsquo;m dangling in a living room with a fur carpet just below my feet. It would be another thing if were a carved stone floor, but if I get such an expensive looking carpet dirty, even Kaijin-san would be mad&hellip; The same goes for Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">, he will probably be furious at me for causing havoc in the room, someone who has never really paid any attention when he explained stuff like going to the restroom and taking showers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It would seem, right now, that my situation isn&rsquo;t only making me uncomfortable, but putting me in danger. So then what should I do&hellip; No, it&rsquo;s not just a little&hellip; this is bad&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">My body started convulsing while I struggled to endure, causing the vibrations to pass onto the wires, starting very subtle oscillations. If this continues, it is only a matter of time before great tragedy strikes. It seems impossible to cut the wires loose, so I have to wait for Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;to return. No solution now; I&rsquo;m completely out of options. The sweat that had built up started flowing down, getting into my eyes and blurring my vision. If there is no way out, then I should just give up, and let it all out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">No, wait a second? Speaking of which&hellip; To the desperate me, I heard voices akin to heaven&rsquo;s call:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">&ldquo;If you ever feel like giving up, just try summoning your buddy to save yourself!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">That&rsquo;s true, Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;did say that. I&rsquo;m definitely being tested! And knowing this, I must be able to summon one in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3 c23 c14"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Buddy, please come! If you don&rsquo;t come quickly enough, something horrible is going to happen!!</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I called out in my heart, and with that I felt the transmission of the message to the direwolf, who had not experienced this before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Seems to be working!</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">And so, I kept calling after my first attempt and was able to grasp the connection of consciousness by the third time. </span><span class="c3">If that&rsquo;s what it takes, then it&rsquo;d be a lot simpler</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;since my psyche has already been tormented to its limit at this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At long last, I was able to successfully summon the buddy before reaching my limit and let it carry me to the toilet.<br>But what happened next in the toilet when I released everything and </span><span class="c3">gradually </span><span class="c4 c3">lost my power is a secret. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luckily, all of this happened days before Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;returned, giving me enough time to clean up any and all traces. Due to actually managing to summon a companion, I was quite surprised by myself, which cheered me up a bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But this is certain, I </span><span class="c3">don&#39;t plan</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;to tell anyone at all that I had almost failed in doing so. I&rsquo;m taking this secret to the grave. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The hardship behind my success, that was its story! </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs"></a></span></p><p class="c27 c12"><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Back to Table of Contents</a></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c15">Daily Life</span><a id="id.3znysh7"></a><span class="c15">&nbsp;of a Certain Group of Adventurers</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Cabal, Elen and Gido staggered down the road. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Their faces looked utterly exhausted as they stopped in front of the building they were intimately familiar with. With feeble arms they</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;weakly pushed the door open </span><span class="c4 c3">and entered. This was a cheap inn that also functioned as a pub. To the penniless three, this was their favorite spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The three regrouped at the pub after confirming their rooms. Then, letting out deep collective sighs, they opened their mouths and let a tidal wave of complaints gush out. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;So, didn&rsquo;t I say not to do it at the time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, </span><span class="c3">I totally said</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;that I had a bad feeling about it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Nothing we can do about it now! Well we definitely didn&rsquo;t expect to encounter a mutated twin-headed Python on a contract to eliminate serpents!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;But, but, we had already put in the effort to hunt four of them&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;And there was only one more left&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good enough that we were able to get negotiations to the point of at least not failing the contract&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Cabal threw out the final statement, he didn&rsquo;t see a point in continuing this argument. He would have liked to complain like the other two, but given his role and responsibility as the party leader, he had accepted his job of listening to everyone&rsquo;s complaints. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Ale was served as the three were still caught up in their grumbling. Seemingly in an effort to wash away their frustrations, all three downed the ale in one go. While they may not have failed the contract, the payment was cut in half, and the cost for repairing their gear was sky-high due to the corrosive saliva the twin-headed python spat on them during their escape. The more they thought about it, the worse their losses seemed to get. They&rsquo;d probably fall into despair without these drinks. Although they want to buy new equipment, they lack the funds to do so, and had to settle for having their gear repaired.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;AHHH</span><span class="c3">&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;I want to have dwarven equipment&hellip;but even the cheapest ones cost several gold coins&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s way too luxurious, Cabal. I also want new mage robes, but for now we have to endure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;We sure are poor. We should feel lucky that we were able to just survive this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Because we had escaped from the twin-headed python we were able to report about it, that led to the dispatching of the kill squad. We should be happy that the residents there were not affected, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Right, right. It&rsquo;s definitely not an issue that we already spent all our savings on repairing gear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Just as Cabal was going to be optimistic after hearing Gido&rsquo;s response, he was immediately brought back to reality by the words of Elen, and proceeded to plunge into depression. To lighten up </span><span class="c3">the</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;atmosphere, Cabal was about to suggest that they drown their sorrows in drink, go to sleep, and then start working hard from tomorrow onward! But instead: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hey, have you heard?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Huh, you mean the villa located in the mountains in front of Kiana Village, right? It seems that there&rsquo;s a contract of 10 gold coins on it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The three overheard this from the drunkards chatting next to them. They seemed to have been drunk at just the right time, so that they didn&rsquo;t think to keep their voices down. All three instantly sobered up upon hearing about the 10 gold coins and focused on eavesdropping seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;The payment seems to be 10 coins or so if anyone slays the monster.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hold on, hold on, that sure is exceptional pricing. But why is the bounty so high?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It seems that the warrant isn&rsquo;t issued from the guild. You get a bonus from the agency issuing the contract.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, wouldn&rsquo;t it be impossible to know the power of the monster? Surely there isn&rsquo;t any idiot who would actually take the deal, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Ten gold coins can be a very </span><span class="c3">attractive</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;price, but Kiana Village is still quite far. Having to set out on the journey without even knowing the details of the contract&hellip;regardless of how you see it&hellip;you probably won&rsquo;t take it, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s much wiser to make money bit by bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The men laughed as they said so, setting the matter concerning high bounty contracts aside and started boasting about each other&rsquo;s &ldquo;grand visions&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Cabal, Elen and Gido looked at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You now, we&rsquo;ve been quite free since the last contract&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;and it&rsquo;s about that time in the year to try out mountain cuisine&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it nice to occasionally visit mountains to train your body and soul?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The three nodded at each other in agreement. Their eyes filled with desire, and it&rsquo;s clear that they had no concern for whether it was dangerous or not. <br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">Cabal, Elen and Gido desperately </span><span class="c3">sprinted</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;at full speed. As they were about to reach the exit &ldquo;that thing&rdquo; appeared in front of the door. A lesser demon. It was of B+ Rank, yet to the trio, who were rank B, it was an opponent that they had a 50-50 chance of winning against. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">According to the Guild&rsquo;s principle of distributing contracts based on level, opponents up until the same level as the adventurer could be considered on par. However, if one challenges an opponent higher than one&rsquo;s level, to say there is no guarantee of victory would be an understatement, rather, it is a suicidal act.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How did the situation turn out like this? It all started when</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c9 c6 c33"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">After resting for one night at Kiana Village, the party set out to visit the villa in the mountains. That was where the three decided to take up the contract, and since the night had already set in, they were thus invited to stay at the villa&rsquo;s guest room. It was not until they sat down for dinner with the villa&rsquo;s owner that they realized it was a trap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;We are truly sorry for the trouble, but is it really okay to treat us with such a feast?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;All of the dishes taste amazing~!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You may rest assured if you leave the Giant Ghost Bear in our care, we will handle it for you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hahaha, oh my, youngsters these days sure are eager. Please enjoy the meal to your heart&rsquo;s content, there is plenty more!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Thank you very much!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Indeed, these are truly delicious~! Could it be that he is trying to feed us well before eating us later~?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hahaha, huh? Haha, wait, what did you just say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well&hellip; trying to feed us well and eat us&hellip;you know, something like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The owner showed a twisted smile regarding Elen&rsquo;s joke. The expression was so unnatural, that Elen, who just wanted to joke around, could only respond with a forced smile. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Could it be&hellip;. That~It wasn&rsquo;t a joke?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Fufu, FUHAHAHA! You feeble mortals have done well in seeing through my act. Although it has not gone quite according to plan, I shall now kill you all and take your flesh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">As he finished his sentence, the owner revealed his true form. Witnessing the revelation, the three knew they had to get out of there quickly. That&rsquo;s how the three&rsquo;s grand escape began.</span></p><p class="c9 c33 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c9 c33 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">After running all over the place, their flight apparently came to an abrupt end as all three got stuck at the gate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ah, we should accept our fate at this point! Let&rsquo;s just kill it!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Lil sis, that&rsquo;s easier said than done&hellip; Oh well, I suppose it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hey, hey, I&rsquo;m supposed to be the leader, no? IT&mdash;CAN&rsquo;T&mdash;BE&mdash;HELPED, let me show you how it&rsquo;s done then!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The two men became determined as well following Elen&rsquo;s proclamation and decided to fight all out bearing the resolve of suffering bankruptcy (or death) when this was over. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Guu, that&rsquo;s impossible&hellip; How&hellip; You lowly humans could harm me&hellip; If only I&rsquo;d been fully incarnated&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The lesser demon was destroyed following its final words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It would seem that it wasn&rsquo;t fully destroyed, but only unable to maintain its flesh. Nonetheless it could be called a victory for the trio. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;We, we did it! We beat the lesser demon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;So we did~! I knew that we can do anything when determined~!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. Really great. I was convinced that I was a </span><span class="c3">goner</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;until now&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The cheering trio&rsquo;s expressions changed immediately after noticing the approaching flames.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oh shit! That bastard&rsquo;s fireball has lit the villa on fire!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;OH NOOOO~! We will get burnt to crisps if we don&rsquo;t escape fast enough~!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just stand there </span><span class="c3">looking</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;shocked, get out of here now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The three of them frantically began their escape, again. Luckily the gate was broken during the battle, so they managed to flee to safety </span><span class="c3">&mdash;</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;however&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Speaking of which&hellip; the 10 gold coins as our payment&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Zip it! We are here to train our body and mind right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&hellip; Indeed we did, and the villa is also destroyed, so this time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;AHHHHHH! So, we wasted our effort again!?~ I thought it was about time we got to enjoy a more elegant lifestyle~! And I wanted to buy a prettier robe using the reward~!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c3">That&rsquo;s why you should just zip it! This can only make our situation sound more tragic!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well, this really fits our style though. We are lucky enough just to have survived!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Really, this again&hellip; We are always talking about the same thing every single time~&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Although, despite all of their complaints, the three looked cheerful as ever. This was just part of their daily life, and the three knew from experience, as long as they live there will eventually be something good in life. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">After reporting to the nearest guild, the three stopped by the pub to kill time. Following this, the three were summoned by the guild master.</span></p><p class="c9 c33 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">***<br></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">The three entered the room nervously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It would seem that you were once again blinded by greed and didn&rsquo;t see how dangerous the job you were taking was,&rdquo; the Guild master started scolding them faster than Gido could close the door. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No, due to not having accepted the contract at all, this is simply a violation of guild rule, please forgive us!&rdquo; Cabal desperately exclaimed. However, Cabal was immediately met with the guild master&rsquo;s smirk as an answer, who then continued:&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh whatever, you all must have learnt a lot just by surviving.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The three were confused by the guild master&rsquo;s reaction &ndash; </span><span class="c3 c14">perhaps he&rsquo;s in a good mood today</span><span class="c4 c3">, or so the three tried to reassure themselves&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;BUT, you&rsquo;re all too reckless! Blockheads!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">And so they were lectured by the guild master who is more horrifying than an ogre. The supposedly busy guild master went on lecturing them for hours. The three were on the verge of crying due to such rotten luck. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">To the three, the guild master said at last: &ldquo;However it is just as you reported, the twin-headed serpents have been found in the forest far from the village. It was because you had lured it to there, is it not? Great job. Apart from that, it is good that you were able to escape. Please recognize the difference in levels in the future and stop being so reckless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No, it was just because we were so caught up in escaping that we ran towards the opposite direction of the village on accident.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yes, yes, we were so scared at the time~&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It was our mistake, if we were to escape back to the village, there were still soldiers waiting there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The guild master gave them a look saying &ldquo;Yeah sure, that&rsquo;s definitely how it went down,&rdquo; as if he had seen through the three who were trying to get past the situation by saying so. With that, he turned his eyes back to his documents. This is how the guild master expresses his gratitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The three saluted and left the guild master&rsquo;s office.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">A few days later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">They happened to pass by a certain village due to work.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s big sis and her party! Thank you so much for defeating those scary monsters!&rdquo; Kids shouted as they ran over to the three and surrounded them. Those smiles were filled with happiness. The expressions they once saw when they visited the village last time, the weeping faces of children worrying about their parents, are a thing of the past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;To me, the best rewards is to see these smiles, or so I think occasionally~!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well, it sure ain&rsquo;t bad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, there are things more valuable than money!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The three were overcome by the kids&rsquo; joy and couldn&rsquo;t help but smile as well. </span><span class="c3 c14">This won&rsquo;t take up too much time</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">And then the three, as usual, moved on their way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Their adventure has only just begun.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c27 c12"><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Back to </a></span><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Table of Contents</a></span></p><a id="id.2et92p0"></a><p class="c11"><span class="c15">Night Butterfly</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c18 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9 c18"><span class="c3">The body of a slime is surprisingly comfortable.</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t hard to move around, nor do I ever feel tired.

Although I wasn&rsquo;t really interested, I couldn&rsquo;t say no given how persistent he was.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s true! I really have no interest.

Kaijin </span><span class="c3">had gone through all the trouble of bringing me here</span><span class="c3">, being like this surely would cut the fun in half. </span><span class="c3">I tried my hardest to get drunk, but since I couldn&rsquo;t even taste the drink, this seemed like a futile effort</span><span class="c3">. </span><span class="c3">I was determined and steadfast in my resolve, but it was no use</span><span class="c4 c3">. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">However, drinking is not the only fun thing to enjoy here. I am the type of man (slime) who is quick to adapt and won&rsquo;t give up before the first tiny obstacle that comes my way!</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">It&rsquo;s precisely for that reason, that I was intent on letting the Night Butterfly live up to its name. I want to enjoy playing with the eleven Onee-sans who are renowned for their beauty.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">But there is now another issue. Although I previously didn&rsquo;t have a problem with my slime body, I now have a massive complaint. The issue this time is</span><span class="c3">&mdash;</span><span class="c4 c3">I don&rsquo;t have hands. It&rsquo;s rare to have so many elven Onee-sans in one place, it would surely be a huge problem if I couldn&rsquo;t touch them.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">I am being held by a tender and slim arm while being crushed by ample bosoms. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3 c14">This feels so good! Did I die and go to heaven after all!?</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;I could shout with joy in this type of heavenly situation&hellip; But it&rsquo;s saddening that I can&rsquo;t do anything further due to my tragic lack of hands. I think back to all the monster I&rsquo;ve preyed upon prior to this day. Hands, tentacles, I put all of the mental energy I could muster into channeling my thoughts in an effort to produce these appendages. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">It is times like this that I need my unique skill &lsquo;Great Sage&rsquo; the most, and gave it the order. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&lt;&lt;Answer. Insufficient data, creation of the designated organ has failed.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0 c18 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s futile</span><span class="c3">&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c4 c3">!! What type of &lsquo;Great Sage&rsquo; is this?! Completely useless in my hour of need. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">But, meh, the monsters I&rsquo;ve preyed upon&mdash;snake, </span><span class="c3">centipede</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c3">spider</span><span class="c4 c3">, bats, lizards, wolves&mdash;now that I think about it, none of them had what it takes to create what I need now. With a heavy heart, I regrettably came to terms with not being able to squeeze any breasts. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">BUT!&mdash;&mdash; I&rsquo;m not the type of man to give up here. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">Even if I couldn&rsquo;t squeeze anything, I could still enjoy the sweet fragrance of these eleven Onee-sans. Being surrounded by their bountiful bosoms and enjoying such heavenly fragrance. This truly is the greatest meaning in life for a man. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3 c14">So let me enjoy it already.</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">I drew in deep breaths of the air around me and </span><span class="c3">reached the world of fragrant attar</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">. For now, my skill &lsquo;Keen Smell&rsquo; acquired from the direwolf alpha has been put to great use. I&rsquo;m exceedingly satisfied with the aroma of Elven beauties and wanna learn more about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&lt;&lt;Answer. The substance is composed of perfume, female hormone estrogen, oxytocin&mdash;&mdash;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">STOP! NO, That&rsquo;s not at all what I meant!!</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">I don&rsquo;t want to know these details&hellip; Doing so would diminish their pure beauty. For real, is the name &lsquo;Great Sage&rsquo; just for show? What a useless skill. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">So, I explained to Great Sage in detail, that I actually just want to take in the wonders brought by the fragrance but knowing too much is definitely not allowed. Certain things were perfect at just the right amount, as with all things in life, there are lines that shouldn&rsquo;t be crossed. Even if one wishes to know, one shouldn&rsquo;t know, even if one wishes to see, one shouldn&rsquo;t see.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">That is the quintessential state called, Gokui (ultimate state)</span><sup class="c3 c30"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c3">. </span><span class="c3">Humans would</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;lose interest in things if they knew too much. Therefore you had to approach the limit, but then restrain yourself from going any further.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;One might</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;say it is the art of only getting a brief glimpse of something. By subverting your intellectual curiosity, you can amplify the excitement. It&rsquo;s an adult thing that only professionals can grasp.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">I explain these things </span><span class="c3">triumphantly</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;to Great Sage.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&lt;&lt;&hellip; Answer. Understood&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0 c18 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">Really? It may be a &lsquo;Great Sage&rsquo; after all. My passion must have reached it on a deeper level, allowing it to understand this marvelous concept.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">Equipped with this deep </span><span class="c3">knowledge</span><span class="c3">, the Great Sage did a fantastic job. Letting </span><span class="c3">me sense things right up until that point when it almost became unbearable</span><span class="c4 c3">. To be precise, I was able to interpret their emotions just by their smell alone. It may have only been surface level feelings such as joy or anger, but nonetheless such information is priceless in this hostess club.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">For that reason, I managed to secure my position as king in the club. The effect not only affects smell, but also eyesight. Everything around me that I normally cannot see, is recreated as images in my head. It is surprisingly difficult to recreate the function of eyes alone, but using &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo; to construct the image not only costs little magicule, but also expanded my field of view. Using this to my advantage, I can see where humans normally couldn&rsquo;t, this includes peeking underneath skirts. However, the elven Onee-sans seem to protect their golden triangle (thighs), not letting me see anything of note in the accurately recreated images. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">As expected from the Great Sage&hellip; What a terrifying existence. </span></p><p class="c0 c18 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">And so, my endless pursuit within the hostess club continued, at least until the clueless intruder showed up. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c27 c12"><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Back to </a></span><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Table of Contents</a></span></p><a id="id.tyjcwt"></a><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c15">Dress Up</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c24 c3 c25">Or How I stop worrying and love the cross dress</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">On that day, the female residents continued their work nervously without a word. They all unconsciously steered their eyes towards that certain building as if something was on their mind. Inside the building, the ladies were </span><span class="c3">cautiously</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;holding an earnest discussion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well then, Haruna-san, I imagine there is no delay to the preparations?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes, Shuna</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">. Everything is proceeding according to the plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Surely everything will go smoothly with her handling it</span><span class="c4 c3">. Shuna nodded in response, a satisfied look on her face. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Shion, any problems on your end?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;None, Shuna</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">. I can handle this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&hellip; Is that so. Well do remember that your role is essential for our plan to work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Of course! Please don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Unlike how Shuna felt about Haruna, she sensed certain unease regarding Shion. Yet, this operation couldn&rsquo;t be completed without Shion&rsquo;s assistance. Feeling conflicted, Shuna still responded to Shion with a nod. The three looked at each other once more before commencing their respective duty.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">It was a bright and sunny day. I (Rimuru) bumped onto the street to inspect the progress of the town construction. Due to not being with Shion for the day, I had to walk on my own feet for quite some time to come. Well, slime&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t have feet, so it&rsquo;s more like moving forward akin to waves &ndash; which doesn&rsquo;t really matter. What&rsquo;s important was being able to enjoy a casual stroll.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">However, the pleasant time came to an abrupt end. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;There you are, Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">!&rdquo; Shion came running over and gave me a hug, rubbing her face against me with a smile. I didn&rsquo;t give it a second thought, considering this happens all of the time, but could it be that she mistakes me for some kind of pet? Meh, the feeling of bosoms is really comfortable, so I don&rsquo;t intend to complain. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">With that being said, it wouldn&rsquo;t be good if this continued. So, I made my escape from Shion&rsquo;s breast by transforming into human form, but not without feeling a shred of regret. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;So, it appears that you are looking for me, is there something wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh yes! Shuna</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;told me to call Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Hmm? Shuna is looking for me? I see, Shion has been absent due to being called by Shuna. That makes it a more understandable situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s go see what she needs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Just like that, I cluelessly walked towards where Shuna was&hellip; Well that&rsquo;s where my mistake began, I didn&rsquo;t have any reason to take notice of it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">When I entered the room, Shuna greeted me with a smile as usual. I recall that it felt as though all of the females were extremely nervous when I entered the building. I must be imagining things, Shuna has been acting the same as usual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Here, have some tea!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">At that point, Shion entered, carrying the tea utensils.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I gave my thanks while trying to prepare some tea&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m R E A L L Y S O R R Y!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shion said so with an Oscar worthy expression while pouring the tea onto me.</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Even though I had heat resistance and didn&rsquo;t feel any heat coming from the tea, I still shouted &ldquo;so hot!?&rdquo; without thinking. It turns out that the tea really was cold to begin with. Could it be, that they intended to pour it on me all along? I glanced at Shion with doubt in my eyes&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The door suddenly burst open. &ldquo;Ayyya Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c3">! You will catch a cold</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;if you</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;stay in those clothes!&rdquo; Haruna rushed in while shouting. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash; IT&rsquo;S A TRAP! &mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It was already too late by the time I realized it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;W-wait a second! You guys, what do you all plan to do!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ara ara, this suits you really well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;This one here also suits you well, Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Please try this one here as well! This is my best work yet, I made it while thinking about Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;W-Wait up you guys! Please follow some order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">My clothes were stripped instantaneously by the hands coming from all directions. What happened next, was the grand dress up party. The clothes put on me were&ndash;Sailor outfit, Miko dress, Army suit and Queen-like corset etc.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It makes sense that they have access to the memories of these, given they are styles originating from my sketches. It would seem that when the females laid their eyes upon them, their creativity ran wild. This mistake was on me for not getting rid of the wood block I had sketched on. Even so, I feel like I&rsquo;m being exploited like a dress up doll, having to play along with them until they were satisfied. Shion put her heart and soul into this fashion show with dazzling eyes while Shuna recorded the point of improvement. I had given up entirely from the start, knowing that there was no ally among this crowd. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">A hard lesson&mdash;If I ever wish to go about things in a carefree manner, I must account for karma striking back one day!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">And all thanks to my sketches, I can expect plenty more bizarre outfits to be created. Because of that, this place soon became known as the holy land for tailors. But that&rsquo;s a story for another day. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c5 c3"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs"></a></span></p><p class="c27 c12"><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Back to </a></span><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Table of Contents</a></span></p><a id="id.3dy6vkm"></a><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c15">Hot Spring</span></p><p class="c10 c18 c6 c12"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c18 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9 c18"><span class="c4 c3">Alright, this may seem sudden, but it&rsquo;s a matter concerning the region to the west of the wetlands that the lizardmen inhabit.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">There you will find a vast underground cavern, the natural labyrinth formed by an active volcano. It&rsquo;s complex interior structure is made up of countless winding roads, spanning an area so immense, that even the lizardmen are unable to fully grasp it. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">Should you choose to explore one of these paths, you may be led to a frozen cave world, whereas another may lead to a world of burning lava. There also </span><span class="c3">seem</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;to be hidden paths that lead to magical hotspots, though they are deemed too dangerous to traverse.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">However, the labyrinth isn&rsquo;t the focus of this expedition. Rather, it&rsquo;s the existence of the active volcano. Because of that, there may be hot springs there as well &ndash; or so I thought. </span></p><p class="c0 c18 c6"><span class="c38 c3"></span></p><p class="c11 c18"><span class="c3 c38">***</span></p><p class="c0 c18 c6"><span class="c38 c3"></span></p><p class="c9 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Everyone! I want to take baths in hot springs, so how about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">My voice echoed in the meeting room, though my thoughts didn&rsquo;t seem to resonate with everyone too well. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I mean&hellip;a hot spring is just hot water, right? You can just wash yourself in the river.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmhm, in Dwargon, hot spring water is channeled into the bath house, but I didn&rsquo;t think much of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">The dwarves Kaijin and Garm seemed uninterested, Dold and Myrd also nodded in agreement with Kaijin. Hot springs don&rsquo;t seem to be anything special, well that view isn&rsquo;t necessarily wrong. But my vision is completely different from the dwarves&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hot&hellip; Spring? What is that supposed to be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Seems to be a place accumulating hot water boiled by a volcano&rsquo;s extreme heat, right?&rdquo; Hearing Benimaru&rsquo;s question, Souei gave a quick answer, he is surprisingly knowledgeable. Anyway, regarding those who have no interest in hot springs, I need to make them understand the beauty of bathing. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">In terms of hygiene, bathing at a bathhouse can prevent disease; more importantly, as a former Japanese I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to promote bathing culture and am looked forward to enjoying it for that reason. But I suppose that goes without saying.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes! Although not completely correct, there are also hot springs without a volcano, but we&rsquo;ll put that aside; As Souei said, hot springs heated by volcanoes are the goal of this expedition. By heating the water underground, a variety of minerals get </span><span class="c3">dissolved</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;in the water, which I&rsquo;ve heard are very good for your body. I would even go so far as to say that it is the best cure for a tired body after combat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">After emphasizing that part, Benimaru also seemed intrigued. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Sounds pretty good, it would be interesting to try it out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Incredible, Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">, you sure know a lot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">It seems they have become interested in my plan, so now all I have to do is to convince the dwarves. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Moreover, imagine this: you have to wear some clothes while bathing in the river, right? If </span><span class="c3">you&rsquo;re only taking a bucket shower you wouldn&rsquo;t take</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;off </span><span class="c3">all your</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;clothes, but if you&rsquo;re bathing in a hot spring then it is completely reasonable to take off all the clothes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No, even so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fine with just a normal shower, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">Eh, I really don&rsquo;t get this bunch. &ldquo;Whatever you guys wish, but at least try to use your imagination a bit, like &ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ah!?&rdquo; Before I could describe things in detail, Kaijin seemed to have realized something. &ldquo;&hellip;Could it be! Master, to think you are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">After Kaijin, Garm also figured out what I was trying to say.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Fufufu, it seems you all have noticed. It is precisely that, my friends. It should be heavenly for you guys, don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo; </span><span class="c3">My words made everyone slobber</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;over the prospect. Their eyes now glowing with enthusiasm, it was the polar opposite of their previous attitude. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Besides, the beauty of hot springs lies in the tradition of mixed bath&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Young master, allow me to help!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Of course, we are all companions!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; that&rsquo;s how it is!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">The dwarves were now fully on board with the plan. Benimaru seemed to be on the fence about it, while Souei showed a disinterested expression. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">And so, the operation bringing hot springs to Tempest State had been initiated.</span></p><p class="c0 c18 c6"><span class="c38 c3"></span></p><p class="c11 c18"><span class="c38 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c18 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9 c18"><span class="c4 c3">So why is bathing not possible? No, it doesn&rsquo;t mean there is no way to bathe, it&rsquo;s a far simpler problem&mdash;the expenses are way too high. The large amount of firewood required to heat a hot spring is unaffordable. Although we already collect scraps and woodchips left over from all of the construction projects, there is no way this would be a sustainable source. Even though we collect branches from the forest, cooking also requires fire, so it would seem irresponsible to waste firewood on bathing.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">Now that the on-site investigation has been completed, we&rsquo;ve discovered the most suitable source with the right temperature.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">Now it&rsquo;s time for me to </span><span class="c3">utilize</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;my skills, using &lsquo;Shadow Step&rsquo; to connect Tempest State and the hot springs </span><span class="c3">utilizing</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;pipelines out of magisteel. Normally, working in the shadow space forces you to hold your breath, which isn&rsquo;t a concern for me. The real problem I&rsquo;m facing here is the nightmare of routing all of the different pipelines within the shadow space. Luckily for me, I could leave it all in the hands of Great Sage, who made quick work of this issue.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">The dwarves decorated the bath house with ornately carved marble. The words &ldquo;Mixed Bath&rdquo; must have given them plenty of motivation, since the final result looked extremely high-end. At a glance, one can already feel the </span><span class="c3">luxurious</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;atmosphere radiating from the elegant construction. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">The hot spring later became a famous attraction for visitors from all around the world, but that&rsquo;s a story for another time. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">Eh, so what happened to &ldquo;Mixed Bath&rdquo;? </span><span class="c3">Well, there isn&rsquo;t such an amazing thing in this world</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh wow, you did a tremendous job, as expected of dwarven craftsman.

But not only Cabal, Kaijin, as well as Garm, one of the three dwarven brothers, also display an envious look. These guys&hellip; They just don&rsquo;t know when to give up. And no matter how many times I scold them they just continue coming back. As a result, they will continue to </span><span class="c3">receive</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;cold stares from Shuna, followed by beatings from Shion until they give up. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Damn it!

We were at the hot spring, of course. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">Yes, in order to heal from the day&rsquo;s hard work, Shuna and Shion brought me to the female only hot spring. I think you get the idea why the others were so relentless in their </span><span class="c3">attempts</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;at getting in. The three ladies surrounding me, are Shion, Shuna and Elen, beauties and cuties (</span><span class="c3">Bijin and Bishojo</span><span class="c4 c3">). The three, completely naked, entered the bath with me. There is no better place on earth, this is truly a feast for the eyes.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">And today there&rsquo;s another guest, Demon Lord Milim is joining us.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;WHAHAHA! I didn&rsquo;t expect such a comfortable spot, this truly is a great country!&rdquo; Milim shouted while running around naked.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">Worried that she might slip and hurt herself, I reminded her to slow down. At first glance she&rsquo;s an absolute cutie, however once she does or says anything, </span><span class="c3">her remarkably childish demeanor</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;becomes readily apparent. I suppose that&rsquo;s Milim&rsquo;s charm&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">Nonetheless, there&rsquo;s no doubt that she can be called a Bishojo&hellip; and I, I am grateful for my good luck every day.</span></p><p class="c10 c18 c6 c12"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11 c18"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c10 c18 c6 c12"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9 c18"><span class="c4 c3">The hot spring is wonderful. Thanks to it, I get to enjoy all kinds of positive effects it has on me, so it is only natural that I would drop by on a daily basis. I may have been a guy before, but I&rsquo;m a slime now. Even when transforming into my human form, I still have no clear gender. Therefore, there is clearly no problem with me entering the female only bath house.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">Today we&rsquo;re having Milim over, which has tainted our normally serene and peaceful atmosphere with noise and excitement. Nonetheless I feel calm and collected, as though I&rsquo;m merging with the surroundings&hellip; leaving my body to the mercy of Shion and Shuna. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">With a &ldquo;pwa~pwa&rdquo; I got covered in suds, followed by the &ldquo;puyo~puyo&rdquo; of me getting rubbed, they cleaned my body carefully. It is sights like this that make up our daily routines at the hot spring&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">Even though I don&rsquo;t appreciate art as a hobby, the sight in front of me still gets my heart pumping fast. Shion has beautiful toned muscles, and her giant, soft, mature fruit (bosom) </span><span class="c4 c3">( &#865;&deg; &#860;&#662; &#865;&deg;) grows there.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">While having a slim figure, Shuna has soft porcelain skin, and although her mystic fruit are not large in size, their beautiful shape is arguably ideal. Two pale red fruit protrusions adorn her tender white skin. Their existence envelops my mind in its entirety.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">Both are great, extremely wonderful.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">When it comes to Elen, who is constantly looking back and forth between Shion and Shuna, then comparing it with her own body, she still has much room to grow, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be too pessimistic about that. This may be her biggest concern at the moment, but if only that was my biggest worry, I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash; Then, it&rsquo;s back to the care-free Milim.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3 c14">WHAHAHAH!</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;She was laughing hysterically while swimming in the hot spring, full of energy. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3 c14">Little kid huh</span><span class="c3">. Mental age of a toddler, probably. But I would like to stress&mdash;</span><span class="c3 c23 c14">please stop using me as a kickboard!</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">Wait, I can actually float right? Even though I can float, I feel there&rsquo;s probably something wrong about this. Although it sounds amazing and enviable to be used as a Bishojo&rsquo;s plaything, there&rsquo;s no way I could agree to this treatment&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c3">I was in the middle of appreciating the beautiful situation, when suddenly I was getting slimehandled </span><span class="c3">in such a way&hellip; </span><span class="c4 c3">It took me a moment to even process what was happening&mdash;I thought I would drown&hellip; No actually, there is no need for me to breath so what was I worrying about?</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">Shion rescued me from Milim&rsquo;s clutches and continued to wash my body as usual&hellip; But as Shion tried to apply the soap Shuna had specially prepared, Milim robbed me from Shion&rsquo;s hands again. </span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oi, what are you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I was appalled.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;WHAHAHA!&rdquo; Without answering, Milim started stretching me and rubbing herself against my body.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oi! Don&rsquo;t use me as a towel&mdash;&mdash;!!&rdquo; I shouted unwittingly. I escaped from Milim&rsquo;s hands in panic, brushed off the soap bubbles and rushed into the hot spring to draw a safe distance away.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Chee, Rimuru is so selfish.&rdquo; Milim pouted regretfully. Hold on a sec, this is completely different from being selfish, right? I must stay vigilant and not show any opening for her to sneak up on me.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">For the time being, I started to keep an extra eye on Milim, and her alone. Shion and Shuna started to stare at me, like eagles watching their prey, which I failed to notice at a time when all of my attention was on Milim.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c4 c3">And so&hellip; When I finally did notice, my body had already been used as towel by Shion and Shuna. This is kinda&mdash;no, surprisingly&mdash;comfortable, but I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to keep this a secret for life.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c27 c12"><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Back to </a></span><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Table of Contents</a></span></p><a id="id.2s8eyo1"></a><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c15">Fishing</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">On that day, Milim couldn&rsquo;t keep her cool since the morning. Or rather, she had come to my room at the crack of dawn to hurry me up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, even though I won&rsquo;t get mad since I don&rsquo;t need to sleep in the first place, but you&rsquo;re really pushing it with your antics this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;What are you talking about! I also only needed a little bit of sleep. That&rsquo;s all fine, so can we get going now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Calm down you, that&rsquo;s not the problem at hand! We may be good to go, but it&rsquo;s still the middle of the night. Even if we go out this early in the morning, Mister Fish may still be asleep.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m trying to persuade Milim, since tomorrow, or rather today, we had made plans to sneak out of town and go fishing. Milim has been looking forward to it way too much, and the only thing she could do was to come looking for me, to get things started. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The way she acts barely resembles the staidness one expects of a demon lord, instead she&rsquo;s quite the stubborn brat. To be honest, I&rsquo;m not sure whether Mister Fish is still asleep or not, but either way I was able to convince Milim to stay.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Two hours later, it was finally time to set out as planned, accompanied by a happy Milim. Having a body that does not require sleep really helped me when coping with the overly energetic Milim. We </span><span class="c3">snuck</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;out of my room and exited the building. Outside of town, we found </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;waiting for us as promised. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty early, I also just arrived.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yeah pretty much, though Milim has hurried me many, many, many times&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I&hellip; see&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;nodded and seems to be able to sympathize with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;WHAAAA! Come on, let&rsquo;s set out now. I&rsquo;ll show you guys my real power in this thing called fishing.&rdquo; With Milim making such a boisterous statement, I get the feeling she may have misunderstood something? I&rsquo;m a bit worried about what would happen if she gets annoyed and starts to make a scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Milim &ndash; I suppose it will be fine if she catches anything, but if not, she may get bored easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Is there really no problem?&rdquo; </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;seemed to express the same concern. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Probab&hellip;ly. There isn&rsquo;t much use to think about it, if it doesn&rsquo;t work we would just have to call it early.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Sounds about right. Then we should be on our way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">And so, we set out </span><span class="c3">to the sea</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;for the main event &ndash; Fishing.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">By that time the sun shone with a bright smile. We had reached the seaside. It is my first time seeing the sea in this world, it appears to not be notably different from the earth&rsquo;s oceans. Apart from some additional sea creatures, the ecosystem seems to differ slightly as well. But it&rsquo;s basically the same. We found a stone bank and set up our spot for fishing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;What do we do with this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ah, so you need to combine it like this, and then hook the bait on it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I decided to teach the first-time fisher Milim, who was very excited for what&rsquo;s to come, the basics of fishing&ndash;from rod composition to bait hooking. </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;took out his own fishing rod but was immediately halted by me. It&rsquo;s a self-made fishing rod, consisting of a short branch with some fishing line tied to the end of it. This crude thing is hardly fit for use in the sea. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Wait a second, that is for river fishing right? It would probably be too much to be used in the sea. Try this one instead.&rdquo; I </span><span class="c3">handed over the rod broken by Milim </span><span class="c4 c3">during the prep phase while saying so. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yahoo~! This one is the real deal!&rdquo; </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;exclaimed, </span><span class="c3">excitedly</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;holding the rod I handed to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;If you like it you can keep it. I still have one more ready.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Really! Superb!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;started fishing happily. Milim also threw her bait, not wanting to be defeated. This must have sparked her competitive spirit to face off against </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash; Let&rsquo;s see how it works out&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">A few hours later,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Milim was astonishingly more patient than I expected. It&rsquo;s probably because she caught two small fish and had her interest bolstered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You guys must be hungry? It&rsquo;s about time to make a meal.&rdquo; Thus I declared it to be time for a break. As soon as I said this, the (ungodly) sight of Milim rolling the bait used for fishing into a ball and eating it, was burned into my memory. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ugh, it&rsquo;s disgusting.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No shit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I was under the impression that it must be delicious because it&rsquo;s made by Rimuru, but&hellip;&rdquo; Milim scowled at me resentfully while saying so.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">What a preposterous thing to say! Why would I bother to season the fish bait?!</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I promptly </span><span class="c3">prepared the sandwiches</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;before Milim could get mad and distributed them among our party. After that we continued fishing until three in the afternoon and enjoyed a long-overdue vacation. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">By the way, I caught the highest amount of fish. Originally </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;was supposed to take second place, however I gave Milim 10 fish out of courtesy, reversing their final ranking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;This is supposed to be my first time fishing in the sea&hellip;&rdquo; Etc. etc, </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;bemoaned sadly. At least this outcome is way better than Milim throwing a nasty temper tantrum. Well, at least that&rsquo;s what I though&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;WHAAAA! Well then, let&rsquo;s step it up next time!&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Exactly what I had in mind!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Milim and </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;already made promises for a rematch. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">And so, we returned to the town after a fun day. But the situation in the town seems a bit strange, everyone appears to be out looking for someone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;They seem to be looking for someone, could it&hellip; be us??&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm, that would be strange. I remember leaving a memo so that they don&rsquo;t get worried&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;Memo? Speaking of forgetting stuff. Look, here&rsquo;s the thing you dropped, Rimuru sure is easily panicked!&rdquo; Milim responded to me proudly while holding what is undoubtedly my memo. </span><span class="c3 c14">Milim, for crying out loud, what have you done!? We were just supposed to sneak out</span><span class="c4 c3">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hey!? That&rsquo;s exactly it!!&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Wait, this is a terrible situation! Who could blame everyone for panicking!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I stared at </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">, both of our faces turning white as the color drained out of them.

This is </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Today I&rsquo;m going to talk about the old man&rsquo;s&hellip; no, Hakuro</span><span class="c3">-sensei</span><span class="c4 c3">&rsquo;s training. At the beginning of the training, he taught me about &lsquo;Danger Detection&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c3">, the important thing is to never allow a sneak attack to take place. If you learn the skill &lsquo;</span><span class="c3">Magic Perception&rsquo;,</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;then it should be alright. There&rsquo;s still a long way for you to go. So for now you should learn to sense the atmosphere to detect danger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Even though I was lectured so seriously, I was still completely lost on the subject. &ldquo;Huh~hmm, Is that so?&rdquo; And so I decided to let this pass in one ear and out the other&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Siiia&mdash;&mdash;!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I immediately felt a sharp pain on the back of my head after hearing the sound. &ldquo;Ayaa!&rdquo; Tears filled my eyes at the sudden pain. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Wait, Sen-Sensei! What have you done?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I heavily regretted ever asking this. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You idiot, do not get careless! Before you learn to detect danger around you, you better believe I am always aiming at you. If you don&rsquo;t want anymore painful memories, you&rsquo;d better keep an eye out and be aware of all attacks!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I could tell that these words were gonna cause me a lot of trouble. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">This Old Man, he&rsquo;s not kidding around!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">One look into his eyes immediately dispelled any thoughts I had about complaining. What stared back at me was a grin that could only belong to a devil. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Do be reassured. This Wooden knife can only double the pain, but its physical damage is in turn reduced&hellip; And I would not use my full force, one or two whacks won&rsquo;t kill you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Oi oi, this reckless old man has gone mad! Once or twice won&rsquo;t matter, but it would probably be horrible after a couple more?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Wait!? That means if I get hit multiple times&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Listen well now </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">, you don&rsquo;t want to die, right?

From that day onward, every single day of my life was spent in constant peril. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c23 c14">For real now, what kind of sick joke is this!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I rubbed my head in pain and complained again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;He told this to me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I see, Hakuro&rsquo;s training can really be tough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Souei</span><span class="c3">-san</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;thinks so too?

It is just him swinging a wooden sword over and over every day. It sure is hard for those who are getting hit. How did Souei</span><span class="c3">-san</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;and your friends make it through?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&hellip;Hmm. In the case of Benimaru, he was able to learn &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo; while on the stage of learning &lsquo;Danger Detection&rsquo;, and began swordsmanship training without enduring much hardship. I also sensed the aura quite naturally and moved on to the next level.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I see&hellip; then I guess you won&rsquo;t be able to help me out here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you are looking for, perhaps Shion can give you a hand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Is that so? Then I shall go get some advice from Shion-san!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ahah. You should be more cautious before going&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Using the prodigies Souei</span><span class="c3">-san</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and Benimaru</span><span class="c3">-san as a reference doesn&rsquo;t work for me</span><span class="c3">. If it is Shion</span><span class="c3">-san</span><span class="c4 c3">, she must be able to understand my hardship. I should go seek her guidance.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">After parting with Souei and heading towards the canteen where Shion</span><span class="c3">-san </span><span class="c3">was located&hellip; For some unknown reason, Souei</span><span class="c3">-san</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;sent me off with a pitiful look in his eyes. This kinda bugs me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Meh, it&rsquo;s probably just him </span><span class="c3 c14">reminiscing</span><span class="c3 c14">&nbsp;about his past training&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Is the conversation over, </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Piyaa!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14 c23">I was too na&iuml;ve.

Unable to avoid it, I suffered another round of beatings from Hakuro</span><span class="c3">-sensei</span><span class="c4 c3">. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash; What I learnt was that relying on others&rsquo; ability is dangerous.

Just keep practicing that and you&rsquo;ll get it in no time! Anyhow, there is something else important&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">She gave me this advice with a smile. In simple terms, I suppose you could call it my </span><span class="c3">sixth sense</span><span class="c4 c3">. That&rsquo;s how I understood it, so far. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very confident in my cooking today!

To </span><span class="c3">alleviate</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;some of the boredom in her life she visited a town and encountered a monster. Even though it had overwhelming magic power and magical ability, it posed no challenge in Milim&rsquo;s eyes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">After greeting each other, Milim decided to observe its attitude. What followed, was a one on one situation against that monster, Rimuru. She wins if she can sustain the opponent&rsquo;s attack, the match&rsquo;s rules were that simple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">No matter what kind of attack, even a sneak attack, none of it will work on me!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Milim was filled with confidence, her excitement only growing by the second at the </span><span class="c3">thought</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;of what unexpected thing may happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Well then, what type of attack would he use to cheer me up?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Rimuru in human form charged towards Milim without hesitation. Milim was absolutely thrilled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Then, Eat This!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm&mdash;&mdash;!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">He had thrown a water ball. Oddly enough, there wasn&rsquo;t any sort of power put into it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Could it be poison? Now that would be a boring trick&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Milim has complete resistance against poison. To think this monster called Rimuru had decided to use this type of trick, he clearly wasn&rsquo;t as interesting as she had expected. Milim&rsquo;s disappointment was </span><span class="c3">immeasurable</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;and she was left feeling rather lonely. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">I&rsquo;ve lost my interest, I&rsquo;ll just beat up this guy. I&rsquo;ll be sure to make Karion regret this</span><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As </span><span class="c3">these thoughts passed through her head</span><span class="c4 c3">, she licked the goo left behind by the ball, which had harmlessly splattered on her mouth. In that moment, a shock jolted through her body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">What is this!? This is so delicious!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">What leaked from that water ball overwhelmed her with a sensation of sweetness she had never experienced before, to the extent of numbing her body. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Kukuku, what will you do now Demon Lord Milim? If you do anything to me now, the truth about the water ball will be lost forever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rimuru&rsquo;s voice reached her ears, but Milim&rsquo;s mind was busy elsewhere. She analysed this delightful sweetness and already figured out what it was. Containing numerous nutrients and likely distilled from nectar &ndash; it&rsquo;s got to be honey. With Milim&rsquo;s skill &lsquo;</span><span class="c3">Milim Eye</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;(Dragon Eye)&rsquo;, analysing the components was a piece of cake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The difficulty in refining the honey to this level is what made it special. It definitely wasn&rsquo;t any ordinary honey, there were some miraculous components within in. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">This is&hellip;nectar? But how is it made to be so tasty and sweet&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">This sensation on the tip of her tongue, the sweetness was top notch. Honey like this is capable of restoring any abnormal status, and even healing incurable diseases within an instant. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">This among other things exemplified the extremely high nutritional value of the honey. From what she could imagine, Rimuru most likely employed a highly capable monster for refining and collecting nectar from the blossoms of rare flowers. But she had no idea what monster would spend that much time and care on producing honey&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash; In other words, it was a first for Milim, who lived unimaginably long, to experience such deliciousness. As a result, the final verdict of this confrontation evened out to a draw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Anything other than victory was rare in Milim&rsquo;s long-lasting life. However, she regrets nothing there. On the contrary, she now felt an </span><span class="c3">unprecedented</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;sense of excitement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well, then from today forward we are friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Rimuru&rsquo;s words kept echoing in her head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Wha-HAHAHA</span><span class="c4 c3">, her facial expression distorted, unable to hold down this irrepressible laughter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c23 c14">Friends huh, that&rsquo;s a really nice reply!</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">To Milim who is considered the strongest, it was rare enough for an equal to exist. Most of the people felt nothing but fear towards Milim, and so the notion of making friends never occurred to her. But this monster named Rimuru seemingly couldn&rsquo;t care less and announced it so frankly. Milim was truly happy about that.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">And so Milim got a friend and said farewell to the boring days.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">Many different dishes are produced where Rimuru resides. Every day she gets treated. The Worshippers of Milim are simple people, their </span><span class="c3">cuisine</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;emphasises the natural taste of ingredients and focuses on raw dishes. Thus, Tempest&rsquo;s elegant dishes with elaborate </span><span class="c3">recipes</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;are all new to Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">In truth, Milim once thought that eating was completely unnecessary, which turned out to be a huge mistake. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Tempura, burgers, steak and </span><span class="c3">croquettes</span><span class="c3">, as well as ebi fry</span><span class="c3">. </span><span class="c3">Here, there truly is a diverse cuisine. It&rsquo;s so </span><span class="c3">good that</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;it makes Milim regret not having given more thought to what she ate earlier. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;The meals here are truly all delicious!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I know that already, so please stop eating sweets while having meals.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s basic manners. If you don&rsquo;t pay attention to the food&rsquo;s taste while eating it, wouldn&rsquo;t that be disrespectful towards the chefs?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Alright I got it. Hang on, what are you eating there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Milim stared at the white, fragrant dish that Rimuru was eating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;This is dessert, some freshly made pancakes!&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;WHAT! So dessert is different from sweets?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Totally different, it&rsquo;s fine because it helps to refresh the taste buds after a meal.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Ohhhh!&rdquo; Milim shouted then finished dining. She finished pretty early, but that was because she picked out all of the tasty food, leaving </span><span class="c3">behind</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;only bitter vegetables. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Uwah, they are still quite bitter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just leave the vegetables, you have to eat it with the food. That&rsquo;s what happens when you leave out the things you dislike.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter, please give me some of those pancakes!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Alright I get it. We can add some syrup to make it taste better, which one would you like?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">In front of her were different jams and honey. Milim grabbed one of the bottles without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You sure like honey.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;WHAHAHA! That is most certain!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The pancake covered in honey didn&rsquo;t betray Milim&rsquo;s expectation, it was as delicious as she imagined. Milim thought to herself as she ate the last piece. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Although the sour and sweet jams taste nice too, there&rsquo;s no doubt honey is better &ndash; It&rsquo;s number one!</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&mdash;&mdash; </span><span class="c3">Of course it is.</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Because to Milim that honey is the &ldquo;taste of happiness&rdquo;. And with that, another day begins, another happy day.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c27 c12 c55"><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Back to </a></span><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Table of Contents</a></span></p><a id="id.26in1rg"></a><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c15">Geld and Work</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">My name is Geld. I am the one who inherited the will and name of the orc lord. We failed in our conquest and now serve under the reign of Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">. That is most fortunate in hard times such as these. After surrendering we were not being treated like slaves nor spent the days in misery. Instead we received mercy beyond our imagination and were treated with kindness. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash; This ushered in days without starving. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">To me, who was granted the inheritance of the name Geld, Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;was our enemy at the time. Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;granted me a &ldquo;name&rdquo; and &ldquo;work&rdquo;. He shared with us a piece of his great power as well. And it is because of that, my brethren received strength to survive in this cruel world. Brethren dispersed in different locations, having their own place of residence, devoted to their duties. Even though there were many difficulties during the start. Everyone is </span><span class="c3">now </span><span class="c3">able to </span><span class="c3">help </span><span class="c3">and </span><span class="c3">connect </span><span class="c3">among others to continue making a living. All of these events have been according to Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&rsquo;s will. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Connecting roads, town to town, village to village, tribe to tribe. In the mountains that lacked food, we constructed mines. Fish from the lakes, grains from wetlands, wild vegetables from the plains. And receiving plentiful gifts of the Forest. Exchanging them based on the needs of other parties. These roads </span><span class="c3">are </span><span class="c4 c3">built for that purpose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Improving the efficiency of transportation will undoubtedly eliminate starvation as well. To us who were once forced to the brink of extinction, our life now is undoubtedly fulfilled, it&rsquo;s like a dream. After all, we have a variety of food sources and they get distributed equally among the tribes. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As long as one works, one&rsquo;s life is ensured. Knowing this, I dully yet uprightly continued working. &ldquo;One who does not work won&rsquo;t get anything to eat,&rdquo; these are the words of Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama. </span><span class="c4 c3">Food can be guaranteed through working. What a wonderful thing. In the past, people were overburdened, in fear of going hungry and not even having the strength to work. And now, we are able to stay full just by working. You can&rsquo;t even compare the two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">We are the fortunate ones, this has carried on from the moment we joined. This happiness, I must protect it to the end &mdash; Indeed, &lsquo;tis my heartfelt promise. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hey hey, you are overworking yourself Geld-kun?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Is that so Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">? Although I hardly feel that way&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That being said, you are already working on street cleaning for the Dwargon residents, training of soldiers and connecting roads among different tribes in Jura Forest&hellip; that&rsquo;s way too much work!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hahaha, there is no need to be worried. Also, most building related work is under Myrd</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&rsquo;s supervision as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No-no-no, I know about that. I&rsquo;m not only worrying about the supervision, but the crew as well. You&rsquo;ve realized that the orcs with us have been overworking themselves to the point of fainting, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Please be reassured, we are not that weak. It is simply a difference in training method, more importantly, we feel happy about work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You Idiot! My point is that overdoing anything is bad news whether you are happy or not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">He got mad at me. Indeed, once being told so, I can see the tired expressions on everyone&rsquo;s faces. It may have been due to my good regenerative ability that I haven&rsquo;t noticed the mounting fatigue. At this time, Rimuru-sama continued: &ldquo;Besides that, you have to find other values in living aside from work, try to </span><span class="c3">explore some other</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;interests. Like fishing, painting, crafting, etc. Your fingers are quite agile, it may also make you happy if you went to help Kaijin with some crafting, no?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Crafting&hellip; how about that? Although I don&rsquo;t have much interest in fishing or painting, crafting does spark my curiosity. Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;showed me some very well-made humanoid dolls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;This was the magic doll made for Demon Lord Ramiris. It has joints and is capable of complex actions. Isn&rsquo;t it interesting? You should try it out too. Looks fun, right? And besides that I also have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;kept on talking and showed me a selection of dolls, saying that there were plans to make even more models in the future. There&rsquo;s also horse carriages and buildings among other things I&rsquo;ve never seen before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">However, I&rsquo;m most interested in the one that looks like a rectangular box with multiple wheels&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s called a train or something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;This is a train alright, when you drive it on a prepared road, you can travel to a destination at a fast </span><span class="c3">speed.</span><span class="c4 c3">&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;smiled and explain it to me. In hearing the plan, a doubt within me is answered. I have always been puzzled about only applying stone on half of the road that we built across the majority of the forest. So it must have been because one day we will lay train tracks on them to allow trains to run on them. Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;pulled out a model of the train track and placed a model train to run on it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Just like this, but before the actual thing is constructed, why don&rsquo;t you try experimenting with the model, wouldn&rsquo;t that be interesting? If it&rsquo;s you, surely this can also act as an enjoyable hobby.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">What a novel idea</span><span class="c3">, I thought to myself. To be really interested in your work&mdash;as expected of Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">. In the near future there is new work, but also fun awaiting me. I became quite motivated being told so.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">And then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I am now contented. The starvation is long gone, in </span><span class="c3">its</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;place my heart is overflowing with fulfillment. It is a delight to work for and serve the great master. I also developed new interests and before long, there&rsquo;s work awaiting me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">What satisfying joy this is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;not only stopped the hunger, but also brought fulfillment to our hearts. As expected of Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">. On that note, I also swear higher loyalty towards him.</span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c4 c28"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c4 c28"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c4 c28"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c4 c28"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c4 c28"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c4 c28"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c4 c28"></span></p><p class="c12 c27"><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Back to </a></span><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Table of Contents</a></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c15">Fine Foe</span><a id="id.lnxbz9"></a></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">Gabiru gradually felt enraged as he grew </span><span class="c3">Hippocout</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;grass in the cave everyday.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Aiyi, speaking of Souka, rumor has it that she&rsquo;s improved greatly as of late. Wouldn&rsquo;t she one day become stronger than me if this continues?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Souka-sama was already a capable warrior worthy of being the captain of Abil-sama&rsquo;s elite bodyguards, and has since become a force to </span><span class="c3">be reckoned</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;with, next to Gabiru-sama. With her training under Souei-sama, her current level of ability makes her barely </span><span class="c3">recognizable</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;compared to her past </span><span class="c3">self.</span><span class="c4 c3">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Indeed. Her performance against the megalodon during the Charybdis crisis was fantastic. This and that may all be thanks to Souei-sama&rsquo;s training.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Gabiru agreed with the words of his subordinates. They had no problem at all acknowledging the power of Souka, who is from the same clan as them, and thus simply expressed their opinion to each other. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s gotta be the case. But it can&rsquo;t be helped that we haven&rsquo;t been put in more important roles. We are still outsiders and were once hostile towards Rimuru-sama. We should be grateful </span><span class="c3">for being</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;accepted as companions. Moreover, I&rsquo;ve started to gain more interest in the cultivation of this Hippocout grass&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Indeed, indeed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Gabiru basked in the support from his subordinates, then exclaimed what had been irking him: &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;However! Souka not only </span><span class="c3">received</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;the important task of espionage, she is also gaining strength at the same time! This may not be good. If this is to continue, I may lose my dignity as her senior, further deepening my shame before her! Don&rsquo;t you guys think that in order to be one&rsquo;s senior, one has to be stronger as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ga-Gabiru-sama&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Perhaps you are thinking too much&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;No, no. The monsters in this cave are unable to pose any threat at this point. If we continue to live like this, we may lose our sense of crisis awareness. My spear-work may also get dull over time. At least thanks to Rimuru</span><span class="c3">-sama</span><span class="c4 c3">&rsquo;s grace in dispatching Hakuro-dono as our instructor, our basic training and troop formation exercises are on point&hellip; But this is not nearly enough! Isn&rsquo;t there anything else significant enough that the likes of us could be of use?! Especially in this town where you can&rsquo;t shine if you are a master of none&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Regardless, Hakuro&rsquo;s weapon of choice is the sword, thus I have no way to improve my spear-work, other than working hard on my own,</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Gabiru thought to himself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Indeed. Setting us aside, the monsters in the cave are hardly any threat to Gabiru-sama&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hn-hmm&hellip; Souka-sama receives Souei-sama&rsquo;s abus&mdash;&mdash;no, guidance and has been steadily improving. Nansou, Hokusou, Touka and Saika have been thriving as well. Presumably, what&rsquo;s necessary is an opponent of similar strength, at least that&rsquo;s what I think will work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&hellip;Indeed, yes. My ability is undoubtedly a bit higher than yours. But, an opponent, hmm&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">These whispers and complaints swirled around Gabiru&rsquo;s party.<br>Meanwhile, someone was giving them a cold look. That would be Vesta. From his point of view, them bragging about the monsters in the cave being laughable, was proof enough that they were plenty strong. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">And since they&rsquo;ve already become this strong, what&rsquo;s the point in pursuing more strength?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Plus, before that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">That nonsense can wait, could you guys start separating the Hippocout from the weeds instead&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Vesta thought to himself and sighed internally.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Gabiru&rsquo;s party reignited their discussion during break time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">A man approached them while they discussed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hu-Hu-Hu, I&rsquo;ve heard of your complaints!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It was </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c3">. Vesta half-telling, half-complaining told </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">about Gabiru and their concerns </span><span class="c4 c3">during a meal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh-oh, </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">-dono. I see you are able to get inside without even using the magic circle. It would seem your ability has grown quite a bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Of course! When spending time with that old man it&rsquo;s inevitable, no matter how bad it is,&rdquo; </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;said with pride.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;So, what seems to be the issue?&rdquo; Gabiru asked. </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;cut to the chase with his question: &ldquo;I heard you were looking for a rival. Allow me to be Gabiru-san&rsquo;s opponent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;What!?&rdquo; Gabiru was shocked by this response, yet upon second thought, it didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a bad proposal. Based on pure strength, Gabiru was no doubt stronger, yet Gabiru had always been defeated by </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;so far. This could be attributed to </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c3">&rsquo;s wit and adept combat coordination, which Gabiru himself lacked. Gabiru was well aware of his shortcomings. He also </span><span class="c3">received</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;the advice that &ldquo;having technique is far from being strong. At the point between life and death, the inability to react can be lethal&rdquo; from Hakuro. Recalling this, Gabiru thought to himself that he could leverage </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">&rsquo;s bizarre fighting style to help him improve his reaction speed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I understand now, that sounds like a great proposal, however, </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">-dono&rsquo;s job&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Just call me </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c3">. I&rsquo;m in this to learn how to </span><span class="c3">wield</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;a spear, and since I went through quite a lot of trouble to get this weapon from Rimuru-sama, I want to practice and master it as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;showed off his kodachi. Despite being a kodachi, it was a magical weapon that would transform into an ice spear upon being covered in water. </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;was unable to master the way of using a spear himself, hence why he was looking for a training partner. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Very well, </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c3">-dono. No, </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">, from today onward, I shall teach you the art of the spear, and in return&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be Gabiru-san&rsquo;s opponent and teach you the ways to fight dirty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hmm! I look forward to training with you, </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;The feeling is mutual!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">With a firm handshake, a new friendship was born. One that would develop into a secret, competitive relationship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">All the while Vesta shot an ice-cold look towards the two from a distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&mdash;&mdash; </span><span class="c3 c14">Gabiru-dono is such a simple man. And what in the world is &ldquo;the ways of fighting dirty&rdquo; &mdash;&mdash; his eyes were burning with a desire to argue</span><span class="c4 c3">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">But Vesta who had since learnt to read the air remained silent on the matter. Among the three, there is no doubt that Vesta is the one who had matured the most. </span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c3 c5"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c6 c12"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c27 c12"><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Back to </a></span><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Table of Contents</a></span></p><a id="id.35nkun2"></a><p class="c11" id="h.1ksv4uv"><span class="c4 c15">Roads of Delicacy</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 350.44px; height: 499.09px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 350.44px; height: 499.09px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Garde Myourmiles is a famous merchant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Not only that, he also happens to be the head of the Brumund Kingdom&rsquo;s underworld. He&rsquo;s an arrogant man, strict with his money, and refuses to stoop to flattery, even with the most prominent nobles&mdash;these kinds of comments about him are common across Brumund Kingdom, and are even known to the people of Ingracia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">However, in reality, Myourmiles is hardly a cruel and ruthless man. He has a surprisingly loyal and caring personality. He offers work to orphans and those in poverty to ensure their basic welfare. </span><span class="c3 c14">To allow debtors to work for what they cannot pay back</span><span class="c3">&mdash;as Myourmiles puts it. Speaking of which, it is </span><span class="c3">Myourmiles</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;who&rsquo;s been organizing extra work for those who can&rsquo;t work for the Freedom Association.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It is Myourmiles&rsquo;s true character that puts him on good terms with many influential people, including the nobles of Brumund Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">To facilitate his future business deals, he has made favors and indebted others on many occasions. By leveraging his relationships skillfully, it&rsquo;s a piece of cake for him to earn favors from the nobles through debt collecting. Because of this, Myourmiles has been able to firmly accumulate power and strengthen his territory. Through this, he was able to earn his place and voice in Brumund Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I&rsquo;ve come to Brumund Kingdom to meet this prominent businessman </span><span class="c3">Myourmiles</span><span class="c4 c3">. I&rsquo;ve got two goals in mind this time:</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">To get more manpower in order to officially set off the hotel operation, and additionally, letting him help me collect food ingredients. In terms of manpower, the goblins under my rule are well trained in customer service due to Vesta&rsquo;s guidance. The quality of their service could probably satisfy high-class visitors such as Duke Elalude or King Gazel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">However, the money-managing staff fall short due to their lack of talent. It will take at least a couple of months to even teach them elementary arithmetic. It&rsquo;s a time-consuming process for these guys, so they can&rsquo;t just pick up skills by studying in their free time during work. But it&rsquo;s only natural, considering that these monsters have never needed to study before in their life. They&rsquo;re a bunch who have good muscle memory but are lacking in brainpower. The capable ones can simply obtain skills by feeling like doing so. Those who aren&rsquo;t as capable have to learn through doing hard work themselves, and gaining experience manually. As the latter method would undoubtedly be met with failure, we realized we would need to find backup personnel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">And so I decided to pay a visit to Myourmiles since he&rsquo;s well-known among merchants to be good at accounting.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">However, the real goal of my visit is to get him to help me gather new ingredients in order to develop new meals that we can bring to the market. For instance, the ramen from our last meeting. Not the instant noodle type&mdash;but the real deal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cake exists in this world as well. If I&rsquo;m thorough enough, I can find it somewhere. I&rsquo;m hoping </span><span class="c3">Myourmiles</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;can find out about this type of stuff for me. If all attempts fail, then it would be time for Raphael-sensei to do her thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&lt;&lt;Answer. Food name: Ramen; Analysis completed. Necessary ingredients are&mdash;&mdash;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Fufufufu, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about, </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">INCREDIBLE JOB RAPHAEL-SAN.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The ingredients needed for ramen started to show up in my head non-stop. They have all been marked with their places of origin with perfect accuracy. The only thing left to do is collecting them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">But that&rsquo;s the problem. Residents in my country do not have permits to enter other countries. Although I&rsquo;m fine, being an adventurer, no one else can go and import foods to my country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">This is another significant challenge. So I&rsquo;ve come to discuss with Myourmiles about it. I quickly headed to his shop in Brumund.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Myourmiles-kun, I&rsquo;ve come to play~!&rdquo; I greeted rather casually, lifting the curtain and entering the rather luxurious entrance. But at that instant&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oi brat, where do ya think you&rsquo;re running into?&rdquo; My greeting only attracted a yakuza looking clerk. A few others like him showed up from the back of the shop after hearing noises up front.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ehh, isn&rsquo;t this strange? I came in casually because Myourmiles said, &lsquo;You can drop by anytime you want, Rimuru-sama!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Myourmiles&mdash;&mdash;kun??? My ass! You goddamn brat, how dare you address </span><span class="c3">Myourmiles</span><span class="c4 c3">-san in that manner!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oi, don&rsquo;t you know you&rsquo;ll get your ass kicked with that kind of attitude?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t let it slide even if ya start to cry, ya bastard!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">They all shared the same mean expression and hollered rude things at me. Are they all some kind of street thugs? I kind of want to complain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Aiya, I&rsquo;m truly sorry. I was told to drop by anytime so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You piece of shit! Myourmiles-san won&rsquo;t ever give a brat like you a second look!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hehehe, mah, she looks pretty cute though; are you planning on tricking Myourmiles-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Sorry kid, that guy likes women who are busty and tight in the right places! He won&rsquo;t ever take you with just a pretty face.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;You really shouldn&rsquo;t go tricking people. But, we wouldn&rsquo;t mind </span><span class="c3 c14">having some fun</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">My words were being drowned out by the clerks&rsquo; jeering, and I&rsquo;m getting angry, not to mention some of the thugs giving me disturbing looks at the wrong places.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Fellows, I&rsquo;m Myourmiles-kun&rsquo;s friend, you know?! Also, I&rsquo;m a man, not a woman. And I&rsquo;m not planning to trick him in the first place!&rdquo; I straightened my chest and announced this to stand my ground. Mah, though I was going to borrow some money from him this time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">However, this would be a great deal for him as well. Myourmiles seems to have earned great profits through the healing potion trades, which was an idea I came up with, for him to make money. Through the sale of healing potions in the country he got to develop new industry in the local area. And through these new industries he came up with new merchandise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">To put it nicely, I&rsquo;m here to persuade him into financing me, in other words, to try and trick his funds. I&rsquo;d be happy, Myourmiles&rsquo;d be happy. And so we may make a lot of money with this idea and keep a win-win relationship in mind. Normally, &ldquo;chance to make some money&rdquo; would probably make one suspicious. I would definitely say no to that. &ldquo;Absolute money maker!&rdquo;, If anyone ever says that, they are 100% instantly considered con-artists.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">HOW-EVER!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">This time, it&rsquo;s truly profitable. It will definitely make money since even Raphael-sensei agrees it will be lucrative. This time, I will definitely convince Myourmiles and make him accept it. This is absolutely not fraud, my conscious does not hurt one bit. Therefore I was about to respond with righteous indignation&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Zip it! Who are you trying to fool here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Talking apparently won&rsquo;t work, ya want me to use my buddy here to sort things out for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">These people won&rsquo;t even listen at all, and there stands a guy trying to intimidate me with a sword sheathed around his belt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Ah ah, this is really</span><span class="c4 c3">&hellip; I sigh internally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">It really can&rsquo;t be helped since I&rsquo;m not familiar with Myourmiles&rsquo;s underlings. It would seem that I&rsquo;ll only be able to get through to them using brute force&mdash;right as I was about to give up, someone familiar entered from the back of the shop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oi, what the hell are you all fighting over in the front of the shop?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I turned to the direction of the voice, there stood a man I missed&mdash;it was Bydd. The man Cabal met in Blumund, the man who once was a conman. After he was hired as Myourmiles&rsquo;s bodyguard, I met him again in Ingracia Kingdom&hellip; Looks like our fates intertwine once again, it would seem he has been formally employed by Myourmiles after that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yo, isn&rsquo;t this Bydd, how are you doing lately?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Ah? I-Isn&rsquo;t this Rimuru-sama! Yes! Thanks to you I, no, </span><span class="c35 c29">I</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;have been doing great! It only matters that Rimuru-sama looks so energetic!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Bydd straightened himself upon seeing me and saluted with a 90-degree bow, demonstrating great respect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">What a dramatic guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great to know. Speaking of which, these guys won&rsquo;t let me into the shop and it&rsquo;s been a pain. Can you convince them that I&rsquo;m actually Myourmiles&rsquo;s friend?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Bydd should&rsquo;ve been a D+ adventurer, I heard afterwards that he got leveled up to Rank C. So I suppose he&rsquo;s more sensible than these guys here. I was asking him to help with that in mind and it went even smoother than I had imagined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Y-you guys, do you wish to ruin this store!? That is THE Rimuru-sama!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">These fellows who were upset with me a moment ago all started to tremble on the spot after hearing Bydd&rsquo;s shout. Everyone began to line up, imitating Bydd, and apologised profusely to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;We are t-truly sorry!! Please forgive us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As they shouted out the line, they all bowed deeply to me. There were tears in everyone&rsquo;s eyes. A bunch of grown ass men all trembling out of fear. I initially thought they were just afraid of Bydd, but it would seem they have realized who I am. I didn&rsquo;t expect to scare them like that but after all, I </span><span class="c3 c14">am</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;a demon lord these days. Myourmiles must have learnt that and told these guys. Then it wouldn&rsquo;t be strange to tremble upon hearing my name alone. If I had known that, I should have just told them my name. With this crowd, they would&rsquo;ve probably just let me pass after hearing it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give these assholes a good lesson afterward but please do forgive them this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">They lowered their heads as he said it, so I had to agree with him immediately. Yet still, with my pardon, those guys looked as if their heads were about to be served on a plate as they were taken away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Th-that person is the demon lord&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s completely different from Myourmiles-san&rsquo;s drawing, no?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding, right? Tell me it&rsquo;s all a lie&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;A-are we getting killed&hellip;&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash; etc.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I seem to have overheard some bizarre things from their crying, but I would ignore it for now.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c18 c12 c37"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c44 c18"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hey, hey! Rimuru-sama! It&rsquo;s an honor that you have visited us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so formal with me, Myourmiles-kun! We go way back after all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Myourmiles happily laughed along hearing that. His enormous, obese body, a symbol of his wealth, jiggled with his laughter. But, he is truly an ace merchant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hahaha, it truly makes me happy to have you say such a thing. So what has Rimuru-sama come for this time?&rdquo; he asked and immediately switched to a more nervous look. So I also entered negotiation mode with a grin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;ve brought something highly profitable for you this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oh? And what could that be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;So basically&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I explained to him in detail while sipping the red tea served by the female clerk from his shop. Myourmiles showed an awkward expression and fell silent after hearing about the development of new merchandise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Given it is orders from Rimuru-sama, who&rsquo;s taken good care of me in the past, whether it&rsquo;s selecting credible talents or purchasing food materials I would happily take the jobs. However, to find personnel for R&amp;D of new merchandise, that would be&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Myourmiles is a merchant so having him innovate on new food ideas would probably be hard. Even if he&rsquo;s good at transforming the new products into commercial merchandise, to develop new merchandise seems far beyond his abilities. However, my goal is only to get the ingredients for the food. After which, we will be taking over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No, no. We&rsquo;ll cover that part, Myourmiles-kun. I only hope you can transport the ingredients to my town. After the new products are complete, I&rsquo;m planning to supply them to hotels along the road to Brumund. So I&rsquo;ll have to rely on you again for the supply of the ingredients by that time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I see&hellip; In other words, if Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s plan works out, I would get to add new merchandise in my trade. Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That is exactly the case. If the new merchandise gets popularized, you can also sell them in other stores you own.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;What! But, wouldn&rsquo;t that cut Rimuru-sama from the monopoly&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;About that, didn&rsquo;t I just mention getting financing? Since you&rsquo;ve contributed monetarily already, it is only reasonable to share the profits in return.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I&rsquo;m not done as soon as I return the money once the business becomes successful. I made sure to elaborate on that point. Myourmiles also seemed to gradually gain more interest, listening and nodding as I go.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I understand now. Very interesting! Then allow me to assist you!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Myourmiles then promised me a plan of financing. He&rsquo;s easier than I imagined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Kukuku~</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c23 c14">Myourmiles-kun, you are too easy.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c3 c23 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Now that the important business is done, I have to ask about something else: &ldquo;Speaking of which, I&rsquo;ve been curious for a little while&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Myourmiles stopped and turned as he was handing over the contract to confirm with me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Is there something wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yeah, about that. There&rsquo;s a painting over there on the wall, is that a painting of me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">In that reception room filled with expensive yet tasteless furniture just to show off his wealth, only that painting adorning the wall seemed unique and out of place. The painting depicts a beautiful female confronting a dragon, whose appearance seems way too mature and doesn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c3">match</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;me at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Kufufufu, it&rsquo;s exactly that! It was painted by a famous artist according to the scene where you saved me in Ingracia.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I seem to have flipped a switch on Myourmiles, who started to prattle on and on. It would seem he has utilized magic to extract his genuine feeling during that time in order to never forget the gripping sensation. But seriously, this exaggeration is a bit over the top.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Ehh, but my appearance originally belonged to Shizu-san. So I can&rsquo;t really deny when being called a beauty, but being drawn like this&mdash;it makes me look like a goddess glowing with holiness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oh well, isn&rsquo;t this a little too exaggerated?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Not at all! I think this is hardly sufficient yet!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">So I got in a bad spot upon pointing it out, having been refuted by Myourmiles and had him recalling details of his situation at the time enthusiastically. The female clerk seemed rather accustomed to the situation as she came to refill the red tea, it would seem this type of activity is rather mundane.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">On second thought, even if I gave my name to those thugs looking after the shop, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to tell I was Rimuru from the painting. After all, if they are used to looking at the adult version of me in the painting, they probably can&rsquo;t imagine the real Rimuru being someone who looks like a kid. Never mind, there&rsquo;s no use concerning myself with that. I should try to show others my current appearance more from now on so they won&rsquo;t mistaken me again.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Myourmiles fulfilled the contract and purchased massive amounts of food ingredients from different countries. I can&rsquo;t say it didn&rsquo;t expect this, but I couldn&rsquo;t find cuisine resembling ramen anywhere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">So let&rsquo;s proceed as our deal states and develop some new recipes. More and more precious and unique ingredients are being imported. My most loyal and proficient chefs will be expecting them at the brand new kitchen.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Among them is Gobchi, who&rsquo;s been training under Shuna from the start. He was extremely upset when his kitchen was wrecked by Shion, and I was able to bait him into my scheme under the condition of building him a new one. These recipes could easily be recreated if I asked Shuna for help. But that&rsquo;s if we choose to rely on Shuna&rsquo;s cooking, there will be too much of a burden on her at the end of the day. So this time I decided to bring in my own research and development team. Definitely not hoping to earn some extra cash for myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;So, what type of cuisine are we making, Rimuru-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I grinned and handed the product to Gobchi after he asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">It was a bowl of Ramen completed within my &lsquo;Stomach&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I-is this !?&rdquo; Gobchi swallowed his saliva as he stared at the ramen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Try it out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes sir, here I go then&hellip;&rdquo; Gobchi started to taste the ramen upon finishing the sentence. He&rsquo;s rather handy with chopsticks, likely due to observation of my usage. Gobchi nodded strongly to me as he took each bite of the ramen and let </span><span class="c3">its taste</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;sink in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;This is amazing, Rimuru-sama! This thing will definitely win everyone&rsquo;s heart!&rdquo; He exclaimed with joy on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Right? Isn&rsquo;t it delicious?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;This is beyond delicious! So, how in the world do you make this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ha~Ha~Ha, that would be your job to find that out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;Aiii?&rdquo; Gobchi&rsquo;s face froze with confusion hearing my laughing answer. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to catch what I mean and kept on blinking as he thought. That was precisely my intent after thinking it through. It would be meaningless to just produce it with my ability. We have to find out the recipe step-by-step. </span><span class="c3 c23 c14">This is precisely why I&rsquo;ve summoned you. But your surprised look is really giving me a headache now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Listen Gobchi, you can use this kitchen to your heart&rsquo;s content. You get to use everyone of the ten disciples here. And so I hope you are able to find out a recipe of ramen available for everyone with this bowl as reference,&rdquo; I told him while teaching him all I knew about making ramen. How to make the noodles, how to cook the broth as well as other general information regarding making ramen. Sadly I&rsquo;m completely ignorant on the details of this process, so I&rsquo;ll have to rely on Gobchi and his crews&rsquo; efforts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&hellip; In other words, there are things that even Rimuru-sama doesn&rsquo;t know&mdash;no&hellip; I get to do whatever I want, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ve given you a completed version, you just go ahead and research it as a reference to whatever end you wish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Although I feel conflicted in my heart, given how reckless this is, I still felt justified saying so. After all, this is the most crucial part of the plan, I&rsquo;d have to go through with it regardless of how much of a mess it may lead to. I plan to recreate even more cuisines from my original world. I&rsquo;ve merely chosen ramen as step one of my grand scheme</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">. I can&rsquo;t just give up now!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Gobchi seemed to have read the air and answered as I&rsquo;d hoped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I understand. If it&rsquo;s Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s request, I shall attempt it with all my efforts!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oh oh, you are truly reliable. Good luck, I have faith in you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">And so Gobchi readily agreed. He obtained a new kitchen built by Geld and helped facilitate both my interests and business&mdash;no, new commercial endeavour, he seemed rather overjoyed by it. </span><span class="c3 c14">Thank you Gobchi</span><span class="c4 c3">. From now on he will probably work very hard as well, and I only need to wait for results.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">After which, things went smoother than I had imagined. I was able to push the responsibilities entirely onto other people&mdash;ingredient purchasing to Myourmiles and the specific culinary details to Gobchi. Myourmiles didn&rsquo;t seem to care about the budget while Gobchi didn&rsquo;t seem to care for sleeping.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">What about me? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">My job is to be everyone&rsquo;s back-up (cheerleader). Play cute and poke at Myourmiles&rsquo;s fat tummy for more money, singing a song to support an exhausted Gobchi. As soon as the two showed a smile, one would spit out the money while the other would jump up and continue working.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">At last, the three flavours of ramen including soy sauce, miso and pork bone were successfully recreated, alongside the choice of thick or light broth. Other merchandise such as dry-fish broth and white chicken broth were also successfully developed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Amazing! As expected from Gobchi!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm, this is indeed delicious. As expected of Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s food suggestion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I was highly satisfied and gave out the passing comment. Now this will definitely work well as a merchandise for trading. Myourmiles who&rsquo;d been called to taste-test the food also seemed satisfied, commemorating its deliciousness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Thank you gentlemen! I&rsquo;m now very confident in making ramen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmmhmm, with that spirit I&rsquo;ll rely on you with the remainder of the plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yes si&mdash;&mdash;ah, HUH? Hasn&#39;t the development of ramen ended already?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Rimuru-sama. We already have so many varieties, it would be more than sufficient to open shops with these, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The two express doubts as they both thought the plan was over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Too na&iuml;ve~ How could my ambition be ended with just ramen?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ku~ku~ku, you guys are way too na&iuml;ve. Who ever said that this was the end of my plan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;AH?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I interrupted the two with my next ambitious product. The king of home-cooking restaurants, cuisine well known around the world&mdash;Hamburgers!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Th-This is!&rdquo; Gobchi seemed highly motivated once again upon seeing the new dish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Huhuhu, Gobchi, the recipe for this food is not challenging at all. However, it is extremely difficult if you want everyone to make the same flavor of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;And what do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;For now, figure out some way to train your men in making it with the same flavor! From there, let them develop hamburger meat unique to their own shops.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I see! You wish to have my disciples run their own shops and allow them to compete among each other, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I give him a smile after hearing Gobchi&rsquo;s response. &ldquo;It would seem that you have noticed, Gobchi. The more people capable of making the dish, the further the relevant food chain would spread across the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I understand! Allow me, Gobchi, to do it&mdash;&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Very well, I nodded in response. With Gobchi&rsquo;s correct interpretation, he may have also sparked ambition in creating his own shop. However, Myourmiles who overheard our conversation&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Does this mean I have to invest more money&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">His face turned pale as he realized he was going to increase his budget again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">But, you don&rsquo;t need to worry: &ldquo;Kukuku, Myourmiles-kun, please be reassured! Those fully-developed ramen have already been on sale! Not only within my nation, it has been gaining popularity across the travelling hotels along the roads. I think it&rsquo;s also about time to promote it in Brumund Kingdom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;S-So!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, it means it&rsquo;s about payback time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ohohohoh, truly, as expected, Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Indeed, indeed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Kufufufu, so it will all be fine under Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s care? I understand, please allow me, Myourmiles, to handle the preparation for the next round of opening the Hamburger shops.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I was able to sweep away his concerns with one smooth talk. In this way, I was able to seal the next deal with Myourmiles as I returned the initial fundings. After which, we generously poured in Myourmiles&rsquo;s funds like flowing water and developed new products one by one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">We&rsquo;ve also encountered a crisis mid-way&mdash;our information was leaked to Veldora and we were forced to teach him how to make teppanyaki. But that&rsquo;s an interesting story to tell another time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Even if there were losses, they were expenditure on Myourmiles&rsquo;s tab.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">And I still continued pushing forward plans without any fear of failure&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">At long last, we were able to develop a diverse menu of dishes. With different hotels adding to the competitions, the sales kept on growing higher and higher. The initial losses sustained by Myourmiles were also compensated with these numbers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Kufufufu, I can&rsquo;t seem to stop. The money we can make just never seems to go away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Am I right, Myourmiles? Everything is according to plan!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Please allow me to remain in your care in the future as well, Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Most certainly. But in return&hellip; I hope you would understand, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Of course, of course. I won&rsquo;t slip a word out, whatever you wish just come and ask me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm, aren&rsquo;t you the obedient type? I&rsquo;ll take good care of you in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yes! Yes! Do come to me if you ever need to discuss any more deals!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I tucked the little bag handed over by </span><span class="c3">Myourmiles</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;into my pocket with a nod. There&rsquo;s no need to confirm the content, it was definitely the usual stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ha! Ha! Ha!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ku! Ku! Ku!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I laughed along with Myourmiles, and Gobchi on the other side was happily examining the cooking machines he received. It was a reward I told Myourmiles to prepare for him. Not only did I eat delicious food, but it also got my wallet full. Myourmiles was able to take over these new rising trades and profit through the prospering business. Even Gobchi seemed overjoyed, surrounded by all the precious food ingredients and cooking machines collected from around the world. As planned, everyone got joy out of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">All the new cuisines born from the incident were all supplied to the hotels along the roads to the Brumund and Ingracia Kingdoms. Apart from that, the road to Dwargon also experienced a similar development. From some point in time and onward, travelers started showing up in the hotels just to taste the food. Then on these roads, chefs and food-enthusiasts from different nations gathered due to their reputation, causing the streets to be occupied fully by different food vendors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash; In the future, these roads were named &ldquo;Roads of Delicacy&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Such is the origin of the naming, but I, at the time, would have no idea about that.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c27 c12"><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Back to </a></span><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Table of Contents</a></span></p><a id="id.44sinio"></a><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c15">Rimuru&rsquo;s Notebook</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 314.80px; height: 449.15px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 314.80px; height: 449.15px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A certain location holds a small journal&mdash;Rimuru&rsquo;s Notebook&mdash;which was considered a valuable document containing records of events portraying that period of time surrounding the demon country&#39;s founding.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Among experts, whether the artifact is authentic or forged has been a famous controversy even to this day.

Since they decided to turn this day into a holiday in Tempest State, I&rsquo;d best record everyone&rsquo;s status before I forget~</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">This document&mdash;records of the &lsquo;Tempest Resurrection Festival&rsquo; documented in Rimuru&rsquo;s Notebook&mdash;begins as such. Though it&rsquo;s written by a domineering demon lord, it has a rather casual writing style, almost like a diary to record whatever entered his mind. The following will also contain things added to the narrative whenever he felt like doing so, expressing feelings no different from ours.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">What would you feel after reading this? Perhaps you would also feel a sense of care towards the demon lord. That&rsquo;s exactly the type of reaction I hope to get. Since there&rsquo;s no need to continue this tangent, I will now introduce you to its contents.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c37 c18 c12"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c44 c18"><span class="c3">~It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;Dong~Dong~Dong&rdquo;, but </span><span class="c3 c14">Slash, Pierce, Roll</span><span class="c4 c3">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Those were the sounds of Shion cooking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">What horrifying travesty lies beyond the kitchen door&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Cooking. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The word echoed in the desolate atmosphere. I glanced at Benimaru. His face has turned blue. His menacing aura was nowhere to be found. It was as if he had given up on everything, like a criminal about to be executed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I&rsquo;m just gonna let Benimaru sit here while I attempt to leave in silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">But&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ri-Rimuru-sama. This is ve-very dangerous, isn&rsquo;t it now&mdash;Eh, AHH! He ran away!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Benimaru ran after me with tears in his eyes. Damn, it would seem I&rsquo;ve been noticed. That being said, it&rsquo;s equally horrifying to just sit there and wait for Shion to finish cooking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Do you want to come along?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Please allow me to accompany you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I don&rsquo;t even have to listen to what comes next. I&rsquo;d rather go with Benimaru to check on the smiles of the ones who got resurrected and quickly forget about our imminent death sentence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">As I walked out of the kitchen, I received appreciation from my subordinates who noticed me. Everyone passed on the good news with smiles on their faces, and I spent a good amount of time exchanging greetings one by one.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Once that was done, we visited Kurobee&rsquo;s workshop. Incidentally we saw Hakuro there as well. Tonight everyone will dine together&mdash;in other words, a feast will be held. It would seem that he had come to deliver the message. Since Kurobee has been spending most of his time alone in the workshop, I decided to invite him and later </span><span class="c3">introduce</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;him to the new-comers, but that seems to have been unnecessary. Aside from myself, there are people who do care for Kurobee. Knowing that fills me with a sense of joy, even though it was to be expected. So I </span><span class="c3">decide</span><span class="c4 c3">d to take the opportunity to chat with Kurobee a bit more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Thanks to Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s evolution, I also gained some skills. With these, I am planning to revise everyone&rsquo;s weapon. Since Rimuru-sama has now proclaimed to be a demon lord, there will probably be more armed conflicts in the future,&rdquo; Kurobee announced with a smile. Truly a reliable man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">It would seem Kurobee has gained Unique Skill &lsquo;Godly Craftsman&rsquo; on the basis of &lsquo;Researcher&rsquo;. That symbolized Kurobee&rsquo;s resolve, he will put his heart and soul into producing armaments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to have him check on my sword. On top of that, in order to reflect upon the miscalculations with regards to the Farmus invasion, I have decided to retrain everyone. So, in order to be better equipped to respond to all sorts of situations, I asked him to make more varieties of weapons.&rdquo; Hakuro pointed to all sorts of bizarre weapons on the wall as he said so. There were scythes suitable for the Grim Reaper,</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;and two-handed great-swords; There were also more common weapons such as sword breakers</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c3">, axes and spears. As for weapons requiring more techniques to wield, there were poles, bladed knuckles and nunchakus. There are even weapons as hard to wield as </span><span class="c3 c14">kusarigamas</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c3">. </span><span class="c4 c3">It would seem he really has dedicated himself to passing on all his weapon techniques in order to cope with all situations. Speaking of which&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I want to craft a kitchen knife for Shion, could you help to make it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Of course, Shion just wouldn&rsquo;t let go of her odachi so it&rsquo;s just about the right timing. While she holds onto a kitchen knife, I would be able to improve upon her odachi.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m relying on you. Also, you should add on her blade&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I told my ideas to Kurobee, he also expressed an interest in the modification. As I was explaining, Hakuro passed me a glass of wine and somehow a drinking session started without me noticing. And because of that, I began to loosen up and give out all kinds of weapon proposals. Most of them would probably turn out to be the results of fantasy and difficult to be of any practical use.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Even though I wouldn&rsquo;t get drunk, it still warranted a reminder to myself to reflect upon the fact that I could lose myself in a good atmosphere. Benimaru was also participating in the weapon upgrade and handed his tachi to Kurobee. However, it&rsquo;s an issue of whether Kurobee is gonna be able to remember anything after getting sober. Oh well, that&rsquo;s his problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">We proceeded to the town square after leaving the workshop. There, the people were working non-stop on the feast preparation. Among them, we encountered a party that was gearing up to leave the town.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ah, Rimuru-sama! Congratulations on your evolution! I also feel like I got a bit stronger after that!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oh, Gobta. That would be pretty good. Speaking of which, there&rsquo;s a feast tonight so where are you heading to now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4">&ldquo;Ahhh, I&rsquo;ve been asked by Shuna-sama to visit the sea&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Aha?! The sea!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Gobta was heading to the seaside to collect fish for the feast. The last time we visited the sea, the fish we brought back were made into sashimi. It would seem she asked Gobta to help bring the top-tier goods, so they must&rsquo;ve decided to put it on today&rsquo;s menu.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it, rather say I&rsquo;m being requested to go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;A second, Gobta-san. If you </span><span class="c3">continue this</span><span class="c4 c3">, it probably won&rsquo;t end well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Y-Yes. That&rsquo;s it, we&rsquo;ll be back soon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gobta stopped just before announcing whatever he was going to say after hearing his </span><span class="c3">second-in-command&rsquo;s reminder</span><span class="c4 c3">. Mah, it is understood without saying. Shuna&rsquo;s request, rather than being called a request, it&rsquo;s more of a forceful command. Someone like Gobta wouldn&rsquo;t be able to resist that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;ll be looking forward to that. Catch something big to bring back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Understood. Leave the rest to us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">With that being said, Gobta is pretty fond of fishing regardless. I bear some regrets in not being able to prepare the feast with everyone. However, collecting the ingredients for the main course is an important task to hand to Gobta. He probably feels pretty happy in his heart despite the complaints.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">As Gobta prepared to leave, there came another person holding a bag dripping with blood. The distinct swell of the bag, its dangling weight and smell alone made us feel dizzy. I turned to see who it was, and it turned out to be Gobuzo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s Gobuzo. It&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;re looking well but&hellip; What is that?&rdquo; I asked, subconsciously sensing an ominous aura emitting from the bag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Huh? Isn&rsquo;t this Gobuzo? What is this all about?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Before Gobuzo could answer, Gobta and I both started to notice following my question&hellip; Gobuzo&rsquo;s answer confirmed my prediction, a truly horrifying sense of foreshadowing arose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ah, Rimuru-sama! And Gobta-san? I was told to bring Shion-sama her cooking ingredients.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Hold on a second.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Just, hold</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;on for a while.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Go-Gobuzo-kun? Whatever is inside that bloody bag, could&mdash;</span><span class="c3 c14">it</span><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;be the ingredients?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Y-yeah Gobuzo. This-this is way too early to deliver right? Show us what&rsquo;s inside the bag for a moment.&rdquo; Benimaru&rsquo;s face also gradually turned blue again, and demanded Gobuzo open the bag. What rolled from it was&mdash;the head of a Ushiroku</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">. A mighty one at that, with a pair of strong horns.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">But!! The problem here isn&rsquo;t whether it&rsquo;s a mighty beast or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hold on a sec! A Ushiroku&rsquo;s head is completely inedible, right?!&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help but scream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">And Mr Ushiroku&rsquo;s head, could you please stop looking at me with disappointment</span><span class="c3">. It must have been severed in an instant and transported here directly, now lying there, its eyes staring deeply into mine. That&rsquo;s pretty </span><span class="c3">horrifying</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;when you think about it. That&rsquo;s a feeling I would never have imagined to be experiencing on the day of </span><span class="c3">a feast</span><span class="c4 c3">. This is probably what &ldquo;eating raw&rdquo; means, but even then, neh&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s true then? Earlier, Shuna-sama said the same thing to Shion-sama, but it only seems to have emboldened her&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">It&rsquo;s as Gobuzo said. I also recall having been warned by Shuna about this being inedible. But because of that, Shion had been pretty competitive about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;An Ingredient that even Shuna-sama can&rsquo;t handle&mdash;I shall make it work then!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The suddenly invoked vanity drove her to order Gobuzo to bring her the </span><span class="c3">ingredient</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;This is bad&hellip; Shion is probably going on a rampage right </span><span class="c3">now.</span><span class="c4 c3">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No way&hellip; So it was me who was going to eat this&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Benimaru looked dead inside. And it would seem Gobta had also sensed the danger of the situation seeing Benimaru like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;We-well, we have our own mission, so&hellip;!&rdquo; Gobta didn&rsquo;t waste any time fleeing from the situation after interjecting. They slipped away so quickly that even Benimaru wasn&rsquo;t able to stop them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I see Gobta&rsquo;s leadership skills have also improved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I agree. That bastard really only has exceptional skill in detecting danger&hellip;&rdquo; Benimaru agreed in pain.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">But in turn, this means there was no chance of Gobta getting involved in this whole mess. So we had to deal with the Ushiroku ourselves. Benimaru peeked at me and patted Gobuzo&rsquo;s shoulder with determination. And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama is also very much looking forward to Shion&rsquo;s cooking. But he is feeling like having some vegetable soup today. Tell Shion I said that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">What the&hellip;?? Bunch of nonsense&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oi! Benimaru you bastard! This has nothing to do with me, right!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say so without giving me a hand!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get me involved! Weren&#39;t you the one who tried to trick me before!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as you said, and I&rsquo;ve been reflecting on that. However, this may be too much, no!?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Benimaru was of course referring to the Ushiroku head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Mah&hellip; That is definitely not happening.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">We looked at each other and nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Gobuzo, allow me to return that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;AH!? If I did that, Shion-sama would be mad at me. I&rsquo;ve been selected as a member of Shion-sama&rsquo;s new platoon, so I don&rsquo;t want to disobey her order&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gobuzo wouldn&rsquo;t accept it even if it was an order from Benimaru. It&rsquo;s true that Gobuzo can refuse the order from Benimaru, who he doesn&rsquo;t directly serve. But even so, he&rsquo;s got balls, disobeying an order from my direct subordinate. Gobuzo may not look the part, but he is surprisingly bold. That would normally be a good thing, but not in this type of situation. It can&rsquo;t be helped, </span><span class="c3 c14">I guess I&rsquo;ll have to intervene</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ah, how do I put this? Gobuzo-kun, please return this. As Benimaru said, I&rsquo;m feeling vegetable soup now. So just deliver the message to Shion. On top of that, I&rsquo;ll gift you this as a token of my appreciation.&rdquo; I began to negotiate with Gobuzo out of pity for Banimaru. And so I placed the kusarigama, which I took from Kurobee&rsquo;s workshop out of interest, in his hand for him to hold onto.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;This is a weapon named kusarigama, Gobuzo. It&rsquo;s a difficult weapon to wield, but it should come in handy for Gobuzo-kun who&rsquo;s gained Extra Skill &lsquo;Perfect Memory&rsquo; and &lsquo;Automatic Regeneration&rsquo;,&rdquo; I said as I handed it to him, and Gobuzo was extremely moved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Understood! Gobuzo will obey if it is a request from Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Mmm-hmm. It&rsquo;s good that you understand. When you are skilled with it, I&rsquo;ll request a better kusarigama from Kurobee. Good luck with your practice!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo; Gubuzo seemed delighted and proceeded to return the Ushiroku head. Crisis averted. Although now Benimaru owns me a favor, I wouldn&rsquo;t even want to think about the fact that I have to return and taste Shion&rsquo;s cooking.~</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash;&quot;Sympathy Won&rsquo;t Help You&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">For real, it is truly unpredictable how fashion would develop one day. But that just makes life more interesting. Speaking of which, Gobuzo was able to successfully convince Shion after we parted. Benimaru&rsquo;s line of &ldquo;</span><span class="c3 c14">Rimuru-sama feels like vegetable soup&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c3">was the most decisive point. I had to agree to that given it&rsquo;s the original ending.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">That&rsquo;s fine and all, now here&rsquo;s the story of Gobuzo.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">~&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you have helped me with collecting information on Rimuru-sama, nicely done Gobuzo!&rdquo; Shion said happily while offering a proposal to Gobuzo. That is, acquiring &lsquo;Pain Resistance&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a necessary skill if Gobuzo would like to learn to use a kusarigama. It is probably unavoidable for Gobuzo to add a few scars on himself since he&rsquo;s not exactly an agile individual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">In addition, what Shion taught him was impossible without Extra Skill &lsquo;Perfect Memory&rsquo; and &lsquo;Automatic Regeneration&rsquo;. To gain resistance to the feeling of pain by hurting oneself deliberately&mdash;that&rsquo;s the best way I could put it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I&hellip; getting hit by Shion&hellip; </span><span class="c3">That would probably feel nice!</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit, Gobuzo! Work hard to improve.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">While I&rsquo;m not sure whether such an exchange actually took place, from that day onward, Gobuzo has been sticking a knife in his forehead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">What in the world is that idiot doing!?</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;And it looks really stupid as well. But nonetheless, Gobuzo did in fact gain &lsquo;Pain Resistance&rsquo;, and it is also a fact that this led many others to imitate this idiotic act.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">That&rsquo;s way too dangerous. </span><span class="c4 c3">I decided to add this to my list of banned techniques and stopped it from spreading.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash; As such, those who came by wanting to learn how Gobuzo gained pain nullification will never be able to find out. It shall remain a secret to everybody; there are things better left undiscovered in this world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">After Gobuzo left, I was introduced to the three Beastketeers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Benimaru summoned them here to greet me. Their greetings seemed to be even more enthusiastic than before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well, if Rimuru-sama can gather powerful majin such as Benimaru-sama and Shion-san, there&rsquo;s no need to doubt the power of Rimuru-sama,&rdquo; Alvis asserted flatteringly, while Benimaru showed signs of fear as he still couldn&rsquo;t get Shion&rsquo;s cooking out of his head. Would her view change after seeing him in that state&hellip;? Although I&rsquo;m a bit intrigued, but alas. Even I fear Shion&rsquo;s cooking, so it&rsquo;s not my place to mock Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I went to check on the beastmen&rsquo;s temporary residence accompanied by Benimaru and the Beastketeers after that. That also encouraged the people setting up tents and distributing resources. Additionally, I came to memorize the Beastmen&rsquo;s faces to foster a better relationship in the future, living under the same roof.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The beastmen were building their tents at the designated refuge area underground. All labor forces were working together under Geld&rsquo;s command. Motivated by tonight&#39;s feast, they&rsquo;ve decided to finish laying out the bedsheets by the end of the day. However, there seemed to be a few people with new wounds all over&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;These guys won&rsquo;t listen to me, so I had to communicate with them through my fists.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">In other words, they got beat up due to disobeying orders, according to Geld.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Elephant beastman and bear beastman, such men who were bigger than himself, worked as Geld&rsquo;s hands and feet. Thanks to that, the operation seemed to be proceeding faster than expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It would definitely be faster if we did the job entirely on our own, but the beastmen wouldn&rsquo;t remember how to do it without us instructing. So I had to teach them a lesson,&rdquo; Geld said as if it was natural.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Zoir and Talos, who are quite strong within the ranks of the Beast King&rsquo;s army, can barely put up a fight against Geld-san over there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Indeed. But this would make things simpler. Since we always follow the strong due to our instincts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">According to Alvis as Suphia, the Beastman society is a total hierarchy. For that reason, they would follow the instructions of the strong when in this kind of situation. The unease brought about by the disappearance of Karion led most beastmen into a state of frenzic rage. However, they would regain their rationality upon being defeated by a more powerful existence. Like that, things progressed smoothly once they came to obey this natural hierarchy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">That, plus Geld&rsquo;s strong leadership. He was able to see through the beastmen&rsquo;s characters and turn them into his troops. In order to perform more efficiently, he turned his own subordinates into overseers of their own operations. As expected of Geld. Such techniques of troop maneuvering wouldn&rsquo;t be accessible were it not for Geld&rsquo;s daily involvement in construction work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Nicely done, Geld. At this rate, you should be able to finish by the evening.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Indeed! We would definitely catch up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">What a reliable man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">And speaking of being reliable, my attention turned to some else. The one who&rsquo;d been distributing healing potions among the injured beastmen. The one giving them potions was Gabiru. Gabiru had been surprisingly well-rounded in doing those types of things. Perhaps it is also a talent to be able to befriend any race.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Gabiru, do you have any concerns? Is there enough medicine?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I-Isn&rsquo;t this Rimuru-sama! No problem at all. Our production lately has also increased so there&rsquo;s still plenty in stock.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Is that so? Good work then! I&rsquo;m relying on you in the future as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;YES SIR&mdash;&mdash;! I&rsquo;LL SERVE YOU WITH MY LIFE!!&rdquo; Gabiru answered, almost planning to kneel before me. It would seem he&rsquo;d lost his smugness as of late, perhaps it&rsquo;s about time to give him a promotion&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Next time, I&rsquo;ll grant you a vacation. You should go visit your father and prepare a report on that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;B-but&hellip; I&rsquo;ve cut my ties and been chased out of my home&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No need to worry, just visit with Souka under my name as a messenger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh, OH, </span><span class="c3 c14">OH</span><span class="c4 c3">&hellip;!! I like this, thank you so much. Please do entrust this duty to me!!&rdquo; Gabiru happily accepted and went back to work. The three Beastketeers stayed while having high hopes for tonight&rsquo;s feast. Our party then parted.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">After the inspection, I returned to my room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">On the way, I started chatting with Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s about time to raise Gabiru to a higher office.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ah, I think that&rsquo;s a good idea as well. He seems competent power-wise, and although that guy is still the same in terms of personality, there&rsquo;s nonetheless a lot of hope in his future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So it&rsquo;s decided&hellip; </span><span class="c3">If necessary, I should also mend the severed tie within the Gabiru household</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm, as our officer, it would be bad for our image to have a severed tie with a monster clan chief. We better talk to Abiru and mend the relationship between the two.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It should happen, if only for that reason. But it sure is concerning. If other countries get the false impression that the Lizardman tribe have bad blood with one of our civil officials, it would probably put them in an awkward spot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Benimaru seemed to have caught up to me. It does help a lot that we are able to engage in the proper topic so fast. Deep down in his heart, Gabiru presumably also wished to make peace with his father. Besides, it really won&rsquo;t be productive to continue this broken relationship. As for the Lizardman clan chief Abiru, if his kid was able to become an officer under a demon lord, it should be sufficient reason to reconnect with Gabiru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The problem here is that both Gabiru and Abiru are being stubborn. If we don&rsquo;t arrange Souka to mediate prior to the event, they may end up in a fight. It&rsquo;s better to arrange things first and execute with sufficient preparations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">So I should ask Souei to help. Since he has already met Abiru, it would be alright to let him negotiate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I left with Benimaru, keeping this strategy in mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c37 c18 c12"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I&rsquo;d say that captures the essence of this book. Although the story does continue, we have limited time. Regrettably, the introduction shall end here. For those interested in what I have introduced, please consider purchasing a copy of Rimuru&rsquo;s Notebook.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">If you&rsquo;ve read it, you should have sufficient reasons to understand how much the Great Demon Lord Rimuru cherishes his subordinates. To the Demon Lord&rsquo;s subordinates, to his people, Demon Lord Rimuru is not a symbol of horror, but an existence that parallels parenthood. That has not changed from then till now.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash; Knowing that the underling Shion was not good at cooking, both still decided to eat, his subordinate Benimaru coming to his aid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash; Supplied Kurobee with ideas for new weapons when he&rsquo;s troubled with innovating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash; Enjoyed fishing alongside Gobta and his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c18 c12 c50"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash; Discovered and inspired the future martial artist&mdash;&ldquo;Kusarigama Gobuzo&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash; Helping the Beastmen in their time of need without asking anything in return, as well as being able to sign a permanent non-aggression pact with their nation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash; Listening to the subordinates&rsquo; complaints while helping to solve their issues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">But it wasn&rsquo;t easy at all to help all of them resolve their issues.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">That demon lord, the more you try to learn about his personality, the more understanding you feel towards those close to him. Especially the part about tasting Shion&rsquo;s cooking, that&rsquo;s not something just anyone could do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Aya, my apologies, I may have gotten a little bit too emotional.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">As I was saying&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Even though this feeling of friendliness may be strategic propaganda by Demon Lord Rimuru&hellip; You&rsquo;ll be the judge of that. Hopefully you will be able to make the proper judgement after reading this. Could it be, that he&rsquo;s trying to deceive humanity, or perhaps, trying to fit in human society from the bottom of his heart? You will more or less get a peek into the Demon Lord&rsquo;s mind after reading this book.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">With that, I hope everyone would be able to see what Demon Lord Rimuru is truly contemplating and wish that one day, the discussion of such a topic will end with the book. With the hopes of freeing people from suspicion, I hereby promote this book.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&lt;&lt;Written by one who wants to know more about the Great Demon Lord Rimuru&mdash;&mdash;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Done and dusted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Given I have promoted the product on a huge scale in this way, record-breaking sales are definitely expected. Becoming a best-selling work, I&rsquo;m counting down the days before I&rsquo;m called a writer-sensei. I believe the journalists gathered here would also be able to understand my feeling. Or so I thought&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">As I finished introducing the content of the book, the journalists at the conference all started expressing unbelieving doubt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ayyy, we are truly sorry. But your words are a bit different from the content in the book&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">What? Different&hellip; from the content&hellip;? I laid my eyes on my notes as I heard the reporters&rsquo; doubts, and there it does record my real actions. Yeah, my actual actions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oi, why is it real!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I remember I changed the narrative for the better, but how come my actual records of actions are documented? It&rsquo;s something I can&rsquo;t solve even by shouting out loud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&lt;&lt;Due to the inaccuracies in the narratives, I&rsquo;ve conducted revisions to the content.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">WOW, so </span><span class="c3 c14">you</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;are the criminal!!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">What-What in the world have you done!?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Excuse me, is this true? So what&rsquo;s written in your documents are the real records?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ah, no, about that&hellip;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">This is bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">VERY BAD.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I had the illusion of having cold sweat, even with a non-sweating body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;And, we had no idea this book even existed, so where do we get to read it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Ah, did they just ask that? That is true though, since the existence of my study is not known to any. After all, I was only going to promote it from now on. At the moment my original draft has been stored in my &lsquo;Stomach&rsquo; and there&rsquo;s few who can actually access it. In other words, only I have access to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">As I was thinking about excuses, the other reporters also started to join the commotion. It would seem trying to play dumb would backfire with this one. I was going to earn some quick cash while enhancing my personal image, so it would seem I have to give up for the time being. It can&rsquo;t be helped, it was time for my strategic exit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">I can&rsquo;t believe that my precious plan to improve my public image just got hindered in such an unexpected fashion. It&rsquo;s my fault for not bothering to report, contact, and conference. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Fu, FUHAHAHA! It would appear that I have been exposed. See you all another time then, my fellow friends!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">While making that overt announcement, I scrambled to snatch up all of the demo material I had just handed out, and used &lsquo;Teleportation&rsquo; to make my instant escape. And so the &ldquo;Plan to sell Rimuru&rsquo;s Notebook&rdquo; ended in failure&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">It turns out that I missed one of the notebooks, leaving it behind&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">That notebook was the copy that became famous for the times to come&mdash;the existence known as &lsquo;Rimuru&rsquo;s Notebook&rsquo;, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have any reason to know about it at the time.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c27 c12"><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Back to </a></span><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Table of Contents</a></span></p><a id="id.2jxsxqh"></a><p class="c11"><span class="c15">Defeat of the Holy Knights</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">(Spoiler for Light Novel Volume 7)</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Upon arriving at the capital city Rimuru of Tempest Federation, a drastic change in the situation had taken place. There was a sudden surge of fighting spirit indicating a huge battle. One of the parties gave off a rather familiar aura. It belonged to the Holy Knight Order vice-commander Reynald, who was supposed to be defending the nation (Ruberios) while they were out. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">This came as a tremendous shock to the Holy Knights, who had just recently gained hope in being able to resolve the conflict with Rimuru peacefully, after weeks of travelling. But regardless of the situation, they needed to go confirm the situation first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Hinata shouted and led the rest of the Holy Knights to the battlefield at full speed. There, they witnessed a one-sided clash on the so-called battlefield. There were five greater majins with overwhelming power next to </span><span class="c3 c14">her</span><span class="c4 c3">. The one that stood out with unparalleled power, it was the majin that resembles a young girl with moon white hair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">That majin was the target of this mission. The leader of the Tempest Federation, newly appointed Demon Lord&mdash;Rimuru, that&rsquo;s it alright.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The proof being that Hinata, who the knights trusted, had since fixed her sights on that majin without moving. It was definitely warranted to be on full alert against against this opponent, even ignoring all the fierce exchanges taking place behind them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Regarding that incident, the Holy Knights got a good strong taste of reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c37 c18 c12"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c44 c18"><span class="c4 c3">Rimuru was the first one to speak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You sure are bold, Hinata. Regardless of whatever reason you may have, this is still my territory. We could confirm your hostility by this unannounced military activity alone. So I won&rsquo;t be na&iuml;ve enough to sit around for you to strike first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">That&rsquo;s&mdash;a misunderstanding! Arno, one of the Holy Knights, thought. But there&rsquo;s no way he could have proven it here. Although Hinata had also already realized that, she still wanted to resolve the misunderstanding through negotiation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">But&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t going as well as expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Reynald and the rest are still fighting in the distance, if this is how it would go on, combat is the only way out. Then, what could we do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Arno tried his hardest thinking about a solution while listening to Hinata&rsquo;s attempt at negotiations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">We shouldn&rsquo;t just be wary of Demon Lord Rimuru, </span><span class="c4 c3">Arno thought to himself. The other four majins. Every one of them gave off a fierce aura unique to the strong. Although Hinata mentioned that those are threats of A+ level, her phrasing was likely wrong. Since the only things more dangerous than that are the demon lords and true dragons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">To be specific, even a calamity-level monster&mdash;Charybdis&mdash;which can rival or even exceed the strength </span><span class="c3">of demon</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;lords, is only categorized as Special Rank A. It is simply a rank made to fill the gap between these vast power differences.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Besides, his comrade Ritase was able to summon a Special Rank A greater Holy Water Maiden Undine. Having said that, if you asked her what her chances were in a fight against Charybdis, the odds would be pitifully low. Even if the ranking is the same, there is still an absolute power gap present.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">And then, the majins in front of them&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">They weren&#39;t joking around, their strength clearly written on their faces. Even though they didn&rsquo;t stand as tall as something like demon lords or Charybdis, these were still difficult opponents. Two of the Three Beastketeers, who were trusted aides of ex-demon lord Beast King Karion; those two are the strongest individuals within the ranks of the famous Beast King Battalion. Their strengths were no small feat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">And the other two majins had been identified as kijins by Hinata. Those are powerful monsters worshiped by primitive tribes. Between them, especially the red-haired one seemed most unusual. It gave off a special aura among the four.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Even with Arno&rsquo;s eyes he couldn&rsquo;t see through its strength.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c23 c14">&mdash;&mdash; This is gonna be trouble. How are we supposed to beat majins with such power? No way we can do it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The number matches up as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c23 c14">There&rsquo;s no better way to be sure of their strength than confronting them directly. If they are lucky enough, they may even win.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c3 c23 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">These were resolves held by every one of the Holy Knights, so there was no need to make up their mind at this point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">But this time, victory is not a necessity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for further confrontations other than against Demon Lord Rimuru,&rdquo; according to Hinata.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Right now the situation is rather hard to resolve, but if it&rsquo;s Hinata&hellip; She definitely will be able to convince Demon Lord Rimuru</span><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;Arno decided to place his absolute faith in Hinata.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Then, what would his duty be? It was to buy time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Arno was in a party of four.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Same number as the majins they were against. They would more or less be able to buy some time if they took on one each. Arno decided to take action and interjected Rimuru and Hinata&rsquo;s conversation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;What are you talking about! If we were to withdraw our forces in this situation, what would happen to Hinata-sama? </span><span class="c3 c14">You</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;are the one who called Hinata here, who&rsquo;s to guarantee that you won&rsquo;t harm her!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Whatever excuse would suffice for now</span><span class="c4 c3">. Arno shouted while thinking that to himself one-sidedly. As expected, one of Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinates made a move. It happened to be the red-haired one that Arno thought was the most dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c23 c14">What good timing. Please be my opponent now!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">It was a majin worthy of battling Arno, whose strength was only second to Hinata&rsquo;s within the order. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Regrettably, if it comes after anyone else, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to buy time</span><span class="c4 c3">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Arno pulled out his sword and prepared a swing at the redhead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No killing intent, I see? Good call. Just now if you intended to kill me, you would be lying on the ground by now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Of course. Arno had no intention to kill the redhead in the first place, he only wanted to distract the majin away from Hinata.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">But what he said upset Arno. Sure, Arno recognized the redhead&rsquo;s strength, but he was upset that he dared to treat him as some lower existence and made such an arrogant remark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">But I wouldn&rsquo;t know what would happen without a fight</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to get in the way of Hinata-sama&rsquo;s negotiation,&rdquo; he retorted, his eyes fixed on the redhead. &ldquo;So I decided to make some threat and got this reaction. But it would be rather boring if I&rsquo;m just misunderstood like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">But the redhead really wasn&rsquo;t taking Arno seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You are the one who&rsquo;s misunderstanding.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">He seemed to have little interest for Arno while saying so. That attitude was starting to piss Arno off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">If our strength is similar, victory would depend on luck,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Arno thought to himself. </span><span class="c3 c14">He won&rsquo;t go down without a fight against such an arrogant opponent, even if they are strong</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Huhu, then let&rsquo;s have a little chat somewhere further away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Since we are going to spar one on one, the outcome would be the same even if our intents differ</span><span class="c4 c3">. With that thought in mind, Arno decided to get a little more serious with the redhead.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c37 c18 c12"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c44 c18"><span class="c4 c3">Arno had left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The two Beastketeers took the initiative to act next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you guys feeling bored as well? If you don&rsquo;t want to get into Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s way, we could go for a little spar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ah, ah. The power of the &lsquo;Ten Great Saints&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s what I happen to want to get a taste of.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">They made their proposal to Fritz and the others, showing their beastly teeth with a provoking smirk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Good grief, I understand what Arno is planning now. He&rsquo;s trying to distract the majins to battle in order to let Hinata focus on dealing with Demon Lord Rimuru &mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Saint of Earth Bacchus correctly interpreted Arno&rsquo;s thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">So had his companion Fritz, who arrived at the same conclusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well then, allow me to oblige,&rdquo; Bacchus responded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped, I&rsquo;ll join you then,&rdquo; Fritz added and stepped forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">As expected of Fritz. Even if he likes to talk nonsense most of the time, he&rsquo;s definitely reliable under these circumstances, </span><span class="c4 c3">Bacchus thought to himself. But he became speechless once he heard Fritz&rsquo;s follow up line.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Neh neh, big sis, aren&rsquo;t you a lovely lady? Lucky day for me! Ah, my name is Fritz, what about you? You have one, right? Won&rsquo;t you tell me now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He couldn&rsquo;t believe Fritz addressed the Beastketeers like he </span><span class="c3">were</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;flirting with some girls on the street.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">I-idiot! How could he do something&hellip; Actually, hold on a moment?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">At first Bacchus had been rather confused by his colleague&#39;s frivolous attitude, when he suddenly realized something. Although he was pretty confident that they were indeed from among the Beastketeers, they hadn&rsquo;t announced their names to confirm it yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c23 c14">He is trying to get the identities of the opponents, I see now. You really are a clever man, Fritz.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">But that was probably just a misinterpretation on Bacchus&rsquo;s side. He decided to play along after recognizing Fritz&rsquo;s &ldquo;wit&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ladies, I apologize for my colleague&#39;s intrusion. Sorry for the late introduction, my name is Bacchus. As you may have inferred, I am one of the &lsquo;Ten Great Saints&rsquo;, and the captain of the Holy Knight Order. I would be looking forward to our duel, but before that could you share your names with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Bacchus asked for the opponents names, subtly following Fritz&#39;s lead. The one who responded to his words was the beauty with devilish straight white hair and cat-like eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Fufu, interesting. My name is Suphia. White Tiger Fang Suphia! As you may have figured out, I am one of the three Beasteekeers. Let me have some fun with you now, Ten Great Saints Bacchus!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Suphia introduced herself while stepping in front of Bacchus on her elegant limbs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The tiger has chosen her opponent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Bacchus grasped the situation and tightened his grip on his holy battle pole infused with magical power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It would be great if I could meet your expectations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;He, he, no need to be modest now. I&rsquo;ll even spare your life if you could satisfy me. So how about showing me what you&rsquo;re made of?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Cease your howling. I&rsquo;ll have you taste the strength of humanity&rsquo;s guardians,&rdquo; Bacchus shouted.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">At the same time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Of course it&rsquo;s just as Hinata-sama has expected. It would seem Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s party has no intent to confront us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">He suddenly realized it. In addition to an overwhelming sense of reassurance, his resolve as a Holy Knight burst out of his heart. Since the objective was to buy time, there&rsquo;s no need to fight to the death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">However, it is precisely for that reason, this moment&mdash;now&mdash;he should fight with all his strength, Bacchus thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Servant of the Western Saints Church, the Holy Knight Order&mdash;Saint of Earth Bacchus&mdash;here to receive you!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Come at me!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Bacchus engaged in combat with Suphia the Beastketeer&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c37 c18 c12"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c18 c44"><span class="c4 c3">Fritz tried to confront the fear that had arisen in his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">This is bad. Bad, bad, horribly bad. It&rsquo;s Really bad. This is really overwhelmingly horribly bad!!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">He had to move out since Bacchus already took action, but should he leave Hinata or not? Fritz faced a dilemma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">His feeling upon seeing Demon Lord Rimuru&mdash;fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Impossible</span><span class="c4 c3">, at a glance he could undoubtedly be categorized as among the strongest. Arno&rsquo;s faith being as strong as steel, he still believed in Hinata&rsquo;s victory.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Of course, Fritz also had faith in her. But even so, his instinct told him there was no way things could be easily resolved if Hinata had to fight that demon lord. Without much proof, Fritz&rsquo;s sixth sense often came to be useful in situations like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">He could understand Arno&rsquo;s thoughts, but now since Bacchus had gotten involved, Fritz&rsquo;s course of action had already been decided&mdash;to fight one Beastketeer and buy time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Arno confronted the redhead whose threat was only second to Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The rest of the majins should have been on equal terms against Fritz and the other members of the &lsquo;Ten Great Saints&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Although the blue-haired majin, who had little presence among the rest, had caught Fritz&rsquo;s attention for a while&mdash;he possessed the least amount of magicule among them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">So it&rsquo;ll be fine. If it&rsquo;s Ritase who can summon spirits, she would have an advantage when fighting by summoning Water Maiden Undine. At least she won&rsquo;t lose.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c14">And with Fritz and Bacchus, it would at least be a draw against the beasteekeers. The problem is whether Arno</span><span class="c3">&mdash;</span><span class="c3 c14">no, it&rsquo;s no use to think this hard right now. Arno is stronger than me so it won&rsquo;t be of help even if I worry. Instead I should think of a way to deal with the situation&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Fritz was thinking really hard. He had faith in his companions, so he would instead prioritize how to achieve victory himself right now. At that moment, Fritz had an epiphany. This was no place to hesitate. Fritz made up his mind and spoke to one of the beasteekeers with a sarcastic tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Neh neh, big sis, aren&rsquo;t you a lovely lady? Lucky day for me! Ah, my name is Fritz, what about you? You have one, right? won&rsquo;t you tell me now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The vulgar greeting that Fritz came up with&mdash;it was to confuse his opponents. Then he would be able to distract them and make his first strike count.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Even if he was called despicable, as long as he wins it counts. Fritz had his own style, taking all factors, not only strength, into account in an attempt to turn the tide for himself. But he wasn&rsquo;t attempting to identify the opponents like what Bacchus thought. It may seem frivolous, but Fritz had no time to consider that. That&rsquo;s how Bacchus, unbeknownst to him, decided to lead the conversation under the impression that he was taking care of Fritz. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c23 c14">Sorry for the trouble, old man. But does it make me more idiotic this way?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Fritz&rsquo;s chances of victory increased despite it not being his intent. Bacchus then began to fight fairly as a Holy Knight of the church. The opponent must&rsquo;ve been expecting the same from Fritz because of that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;The name is Alvis. Golden Snake Horn Alvis. Sadly you&rsquo;re not my type.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ayyy, that&rsquo;s a real shame. Then, what happens now? Should we begin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Fritz sighed as he gazed at Alvis, a seductive beauty with golden and black hair floating around her head. Although her eyes were beautiful like jewels, deep down that snake&rsquo;s pupils seemed to hide a bottomless abyss. Fritz was disappointed that Alvis had not let down her guard one bit. The air surrounding her was cruel and cold, and she didn&rsquo;t make a single move upon hearing Fritz&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">But it&rsquo;s only natural; this is after all a monster who commands the Beast King&rsquo;s army, no way that it will become careless that easily&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">That strategy may have failed, but it was nothing to worry about. The scheme to distract an opponent is multifaceted; Fritz had prepared a set of tricks he could link together&mdash;but while considering his next move, he experienced a sudden burst of incredible magicule. He turned his eyes wide towards its source; an earth-shattering shock wave hit him at the same time.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ara ara, that&rsquo;s Shion-sama. She&rsquo;s as reckless as always&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Even though he heard Alvis&rsquo;s words, Fritz did not feel there was any time to be concerned about such issues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;ve got to be kidding!? T-that&rsquo;s Gerald&rsquo;s &lsquo;Inferno Spirit Flame&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Fritz&rsquo;s &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo; sensed the casting of his colleague&rsquo;s most powerful magical attack. To his complete surprise, the majin named Shion was able to endure it completely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Or rather, she straight up cut it in half.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Fritz froze in shock at the abnormal sight. That was tactical nuclear strike magic&mdash;something more powerful than even &lsquo;Heat Disintegration&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s likely one of the most powerful magics doable by humans, and even stronger than ultimates of elven magic&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">However, such an act appeared to have been handled with ease by a majin who wasn&rsquo;t even a demon lord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">That&rsquo;s something Fritz&rsquo;s common sense couldn&rsquo;t process, an abnormal situation. Yet, such unrealistic sights continued. The sounds of fierce clashes between weapons filled the air. The strong wind invoked by the battles decimated the nearby vegetation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">At that moment, Arno of the Holy Knight Order had been dominating the red-haired majin with his swordsmanship. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">And he very much should be</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ah, Benimaru-sama is truly magnificent. He&rsquo;s so eager to study, even about that person&rsquo;s sword art.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Fritz heard the whisper of the seductive woman, Alvis, in front of him. He couldn&rsquo;t understand the meaning of her words. The red-haired majin, Benimaru, could only defend against the barrage of elegant yet furious sword slashes. Yet Alvis was watching Benimaru without worrying about his chances of triumph.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;What are you talking about? It&rsquo;s obvious that it has been Arno&rsquo;s one-sided attack no matter how you look at it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Learning about sword art? There&rsquo;s no way he has that time to spare. He won&rsquo;t come out in one piece if he looks down on a genius such as Arno like that</span><span class="c4 c3">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">That&rsquo;s how it should have been.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">But the problem for Fritz was Alvis&rsquo;s silence. She only responded to him with a cold glance. The sword and tachi came in contact without a moment&rsquo;s break. As the weapons danced back and forth, sparks flew as the two blades clashed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Alvis simply watched the spectacle in silence. Before Alvis turned her eyes back, Fritz couldn&rsquo;t move, his hands tightly clasping his sword. In hindsight, she was full of openings, but Fritz&rsquo;s sixth sense warned him that it was obviously a dangerous temptation. As long as he could buy some time, there was no need to rush an attack. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Fritz&rsquo;s head was spinning; he decided to simply accompany Alvis in her observations. Moments later, Alvis, who&rsquo;d been staring at Benimaru&rsquo;s battle, suddenly seemed to have lost interest and set her eyes back on Fritz.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;The battle is over. Of course that man couldn&rsquo;t rival Benimaru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No, that would mean Arno&rsquo;s strength in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Arno should have had the upper hand. Yet even so, Alvis announced Benimaru&rsquo;s victory herself. Fritz was enraged by this and barely managed to contain the anger in his heart when responding to Alvis. Yet he was stopped by Alvis with a raised hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You are wrong, that&rsquo;s simply how it looks. The battle won&rsquo;t last any longer, and surely you won&rsquo;t be satisfied with just arguing. How about you and I just spend the time together seeing Benimaru-sama&rsquo;s battle to the end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Even though Fritz still couldn&rsquo;t accept what she had said, it was his intent to request that as well. He only said this partially out of anger and partially to provoke his opponent: &ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t matter since Arno will definitely come out on top. Is it alright if the tide turns on onee-chan like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Yet Alvis laughed at Fritz&rsquo;s provocation, Then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Benimaru-sama, as a matter of fact, could incinerate the whole area here. Right now he&rsquo;s only sparing you all for the convenience of his sword practice. If he were to fight seriously, your friend Arno-kun would likely have been wiped off the face of the world already.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">She wasn&rsquo;t saying this to mock Fritz, he realized they were words of pity. It began to dawn on him&hellip; He had the illusion of cold sweat flowing down his back. His heart was ensnared by fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">That&rsquo;s just fear-mongering</span><span class="c3">&mdash;</span><span class="c3 c14">my usual tactic. To make me lose my cool and fight without my full strength&hellip; I&rsquo;ve heard rumors of Golden Snake Horn Alvis being an intelligent strategist. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if she were to use psychological tactics to shake me&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Even if it was a lie, Fritz convinced himself to believe it. There&rsquo;s no way he could&rsquo;ve admitted that someone would go easy to avoid casualties when confronting them, the strongest existence among men, the Holy Knight Order. It was Fritz&rsquo;s sincere conviction.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Yet the ruthless moment of truth finally arrived&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Fritz didn&rsquo;t know whether this majin named Benimaru was actually good at using flame or not, but his swordsmanship was definitely on par with Arno. He was able to evade every fierce attack by Arno&rsquo;s sword using his giant tachi.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Fu, fufu, it surprises me you are able to evade my attacks to this extent, neh. And deflecting all of them, it&rsquo;s almost as if you are slashing down water.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;That is only natural. My master in sword art taught me the ultimate zone is detecting the &ldquo;flow&rdquo;. If you carefully listen to your sword&rsquo;s sound and become one with the sword, you can see that flow as clear as day. I&rsquo;ve yet to reach that realm, but I&rsquo;ve seen through your sword </span><span class="c3">style.</span><span class="c4 c3">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Dreadful, truly horrifying. It doesn&rsquo;t seem that you are bragging either. If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ve also made up my mind. Behold, I shall demonstrate why I am called the strongest among the Holy Knights&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The fight between Arno and Benimaru entered its climax under Fritz&rsquo;s and Alvis&rsquo;s observation. Fritz had only heard of Arno&rsquo;s secret technique, he never had the chance to witness it in real life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The invisible sword technique that is said to be able to cut down any monster in one slash. It is the strongest sword technique wielded only by Arno, the one adored by five elemental spirits, and whose strength is only next to Hinata.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Behold the magic purifying shine and etch it onto your body. Take this, Five-elemental Spirit Sword&mdash;&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Arno&rsquo;s beloved sword radiated five brilliant beams of light. Earth, water, fire, wind and air, the spiritual lights of five different elements. These beams combined and unleashed a killing blow that was impossible to defend against.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The shining blade hurtled towards Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c23 c14">Is this Arno&rsquo;s ultimate&hellip; Eeh, I thought he would never show that in front of others. Can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s been pushed to this point&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Fritz thought so while confirming his friend&rsquo;s victory.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">However!</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Na&iuml;ve&mdash;&mdash;Pulse Slash of Flowing Water!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">The majin Benimaru raised his tachi and swung down unfazed. As a result, Arno&rsquo;s shining blow was received gently by Benimaru&rsquo;s tachi, flinging his sword into the air with a resounding clang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Fritz wasn&rsquo;t able to see a thing, but it was possible to infer what happened. To put it simply, Benimaru&rsquo;s technique was able to destroy the power of Arno&rsquo;s attack. Its shock wave propagated towards Arno. He saw it and made </span><span class="c3">the</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;split-second decision to release his sword out of fear that the wave would harm his sword-holding hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Fritz couldn&rsquo;t imagine anything else and had to believe that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">In other words, this bastard called Benimaru even mastered a better sword art than Arno!?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">He couldn&rsquo;t laugh at it even if it was a joke. This was all a nightmarish experience to Fritz&hellip; But it was all reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I told you, your technique has been seen through. Your sword art is still amateurish. It&rsquo;s capable in terms of power, but it is pointless if you can&rsquo;t hit your target with it. I&rsquo;d advise you to understand that point,&rdquo; Benimaru told Arno and sheathed his tachi.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;ve&hellip; lost&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Arno fell to his knees on the spot after admitting his defeat. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">After witnessing the result, Alvis turned towards Fritz.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well, I told you so, didn&rsquo;t I? There is no need to ever question Benimaru-sama&rsquo;s victory. But your friend did try his best. Then, what do you plan to do now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Alvis&rsquo;s seductive eyes shone with a light of curiosity and intrigue. She asked while observing how Fritz would react. In response, Fritz&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">I can&rsquo;t believe Arno has lost&hellip; This is way worse than I imagined. It still depends on how Hinata-sama and Demon Lord Rimuru would resolve everything, but I&rsquo;d better make up my mind here. These people are not planning to kill us. But since the fight was started by Reynald, there&rsquo;s no way we could just resume a friendly negotiation. But even so it doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter much if I begin to fight as well&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Deeply shaken, he observed his surroundings with &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo;. Arno was defeated, just as he&rsquo;d witnessed. Reynald&rsquo;s side also seemed to be concluding as more and more Holy Knights had fallen. A complete defeat. Bacchus on the other hand was putting up an equal fight against Beastketeer Suphia.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">And Ritase&mdash;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">She&rsquo;d been tied up with some unknown things, and her cheeks were blushing scarlet. The blue-haired majin next to her seemed to be protecting her in the midst of some battle. The ones exchanging blows are&hellip;the blue-haired majin and Water Maiden Undine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Could that be the &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; skill? If that&rsquo;s the case, it would make sense why his presence is barely felt</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">What surprised him more was the dominance expressed by the majin&rsquo;s Clone over Undine. Its blows dealt by the hands of the Clone, which should have been constructed using magicule, were effective even against greater spirits that have resistance against physical attacks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Which means the true body must be even stronger</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">It would seem that Fritz had underestimated the threat of this blue-haired majin purely based on the magicule of its Clone. In other words, he had misjudged the majin&rsquo;s strength from the start, a classic blunder on Fritz&rsquo;s part.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Has Ritase also been defeated as well? Uncle Bacchus seems to be barely managing a draw. The only one remaining is Hinata-sama&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Her battle with Demon Lord Rimuru was something beyond Fritz&rsquo;s understanding. Those were speeds unfathomable to a commoner&mdash;even &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo; was meaningless in interpreting the ongoing battle, whose speed had exceeded the processing power of the human brain. Fritz&rsquo;s concern for her would be meaningless regardless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">I seem absolutely outmatched by sheer strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">He would&rsquo;ve probably only hindered Hinata rather than giving her a hand. That being the case, there was only one thing Fritz could do. He spoke to Alvis who&rsquo;d been awaiting an answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Although I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much use in trying to fight, do you mind spending some time with me? I would be ashamed to see my friends again if that were not the case, wouldn&rsquo;t I now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Fritz had dignity too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Even if victory or failure pose no purpose, the battle itself may hold some meaning</span><span class="c4 c3">, Fritz thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash; At times like that you just have to act like an idiot, huh Fritz &mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Hinata would probably tease him with such a line.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14">Yeah, yeah&mdash;&mdash; Yeah</span><span class="c4 c3">, Fritz thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">But he embraced that part of himself wholeheartedly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Fufufu, alright then. You are beginning to impress me, Holy Knight Fritz-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m most grateful. We have much to learn from each other now, Beasteekeer&mdash;Golden Snake Horn Alvis-dono&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">A tiny smile emerged on Fritz&rsquo;s lips before he dove into the battle against Alvis.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c27 c12"><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Back to </a></span><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Table of Contents</a></span></p><a id="id.z337ya"></a><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 733.60px; height: 1043.07px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 733.60px; height: 1043.07px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.3j2qqm3"></a><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c15">Payday in Tempest</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">(Spoiler for Light Novel Volume 8)</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 358.61px; height: 510.63px;"><img alt="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/tensei-shitara-slime-datta-ken/images/d/d8/Cover11.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20171228201226" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 358.61px; height: 510.63px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">The Opening festival had come to an end and the prosperous days continued. As part of it, </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;was busy throughout the day. Although he was occupied with lots of work, these were all fulfilling and joyful days.<br>And all of this was thanks to </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&rsquo;s master. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The glorious reward from his master&mdash;Demon Lord Rimuru. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Thinking back a few years&rsquo; time, Rigurdo was the elder of the original goblin tribe. They didn&rsquo;t have names, and were also confronted with the disappearance of the Jura Forest&rsquo;s guardian.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The age of unrest commenced.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">We were just so lucky back then</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;couldn&rsquo;t forget it, deeply grateful in his heart. Had his Goblin underlings, under the dire circumstances accidentally done something to Rimuru-sama&hellip; If that had been the case, </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;and his tribe would not be here today. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Having said that, Rimuru at the time already gave off immeasurable magicules, which dispelled any thoughts they had of attempting an attack on him. </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;and his men weren&rsquo;t planning on doing anything, and now knowing the outcome of it all, that was what saved them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">After all, with Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s menacing display, we were able to clear out the direwolf threat. That smooth and shining fluid body that shouts aesthetic. Upon laying eyes on him in action, it&rsquo;s simply stupid to even think about defying him. I bet whoever he may have encountered would also have expressed loyalty to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;nodded to himself as he recalled the past. There exist such surprising outcomes in life. </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;had made a wise choice. However, most people in this world wouldn&rsquo;t have made the right choice. If Rimuru had shown up in a different place, it might just have ended up in tragedy. For instance, what if he encountered human adventurers instead? Those who are incapable of seeing the nature of monsters would probably make the judgement entirely based on the appearance of things. You could expect the encounter to turn violent within a matter of seconds. In other words, Rimuru&rsquo;s first encounter with </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;was, in a sense, a blessing to both parties. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Afterwards, Rimuru accepted </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&rsquo;s request and became their leader&mdash;leading not only the goblins, but the ogres, orcs, lizardmen and forest spirits too. Eventually settling down within the forest and becoming the demon lord to command all races. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">, who&rsquo;d been </span><span class="c3">reminiscing</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;about the past </span><span class="c3">in the midst</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;of a busy day, was called back to reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh-oh, there you are. </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">-dono, I&rsquo;ve been looking for you for some time </span><span class="c3">now.</span><span class="c4 c3">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Myourmiles-dono? Is there a problem?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not exactly a problem&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Myourmiles stopped for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">He, a human, had been entrusted by Rimuru with the duty of managing the Finance Department of Tempest State. He had become an irreplaceable member of the country, who also worked very diligently like </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">He responded to Myourmiles with a smile. Thanks to Myourmiles, </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;was able to resolve his own concerns. He was burdened by self-doubts regarding what he and the rest of </span><span class="c3">Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">subordinates</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;meant to him&mdash;a demon lord with immense power. </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;sighed at his lack of strength, while being subjected to such a powerful existence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Among Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinates, there were many majin who were known for their combat abilities. For instance, the members of Kurenai.</span><sup class="c3 c30"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;These were strong individuals, far more powerful than </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">, who didn&rsquo;t put shame on the name of Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s subordinates. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Apart from them, there were the orcs led by Geld. They were not only pivotal for their specialized role in the city&rsquo;s development, but also tasked with defending and guarding it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">And then, we had Diablo. That Demon was extremely unusual. There was no doubt that he bears immeasurable strength. It gave </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;a cold shiver simply imagining having to fight him as a foe. His loyalty towards Rimuru was unquestionable, yet in reality, there were many who feared Diablo. He was on good terms with Ranga, and also agreed to </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&rsquo;s request with a smile&hellip; But even with that, anyone would</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;subconsciously</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;be scared in the face of an obviously higher existence compared to oneself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">And so it bore the seed of </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&rsquo;s concern. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Given that at the moment, there were many powerful majins who had joined under Rimuru&rsquo;s reign, he worried about what he could contribute as one of them. </span><span class="c3">Despite such a</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;thought, </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&rsquo;s strength was easily above Rank A. It&rsquo;s not that he was weak, it was simply the others outclassing him to an unreasonable degree. Or in other words, </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;was still a rather strong member within Tempest State. But </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;did not realize that and earnestly worked hard everyday in order to competently fulfill the role of Goblin King entrusted to him by Rimuru. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Myourmiles&rsquo;s presence was like a saving grace to Rigurdo&rsquo;s feelings of insecurity. The man who had no concern for strength and even crossed the racial boundary between human and monster. </span><span class="c3">Myourmiles, </span><span class="c4 c3">the head of the Finance Department&mdash;Minister of Finance. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">So that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s been all along, then there&rsquo;s nothing to be worried about. Rimuru-sama has no prerequisite for our strength, moreover, our master is a majestic demon lord! This just can&rsquo;t do it, I am still too close-minded and caused myself such worries. These are just unnecessary concerns. It is simply an instinct for monsters to judge one another based on strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;made a wry laugh as he came to that conclusion, quickly abandoning his worries and refocusing on the town&rsquo;s operations. </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;was grateful towards Myourmiles in his heart for that very reason. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">His lack of ability compared to Myourmiles still passed through his head </span><span class="c3">occasionally</span><span class="c3">, though he has long since treated him more like a friend. That was what gave </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo&rsquo;s tone a sense of intimacy when talking to</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Myourmiles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well, what seems to be the issue?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ay, I feel as though myself alone won&rsquo;t think up an answer. Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s thrusted another hard task down my throat again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Myourmiles put on an indignant attitude while &ldquo;complaining&rdquo;, albeit unable to conceal his joy. </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;smiled upon hearing this. It was precisely the hard tasks he complained about that were proof of the trust Rimuru had in him. Rimuru would never hand an impossible task to his subordinates, this thus symbolized the expectations Rimuru had placed upon Myourmiles. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Right now I&rsquo;m also busy learning about how the separation of powers works. What comes first now is legislation. Rimuru-sama has ordered me to draft our nation&rsquo;s constitution.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Another over-the-top idea, he&rsquo;s always the same&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Even though Rimuru acted as the king of the country, he seemed to have no intention of running it. Since if he had participated in politics, all of his free time would&rsquo;ve been gone. Yet the authority lay not among the citizens, but with the leader, Rimuru. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Tempest State&mdash;or Jura Tempest Federation&mdash;was based on an alliance between multiple races. People of different personalities and ideologies all gathering under Rimuru&rsquo;s protection is what made Tempest State a united nation. Bottom line being, if Rimuru was not around, there would be no nation to begin with. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;had nothing to say against Rimuru holding the authority. As such, with hidden thoughts in his heart, he was handed complete political authority.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Based on the current condition, we need to assemble key administration departments and establish a legislation department consisting of a thousand men alongside a judicial department to enforce the laws.&rdquo; &mdash; That was his order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Needless to say, it was an order given after diplomatic discussions with the western states. But thankfully, Rimuru didn&rsquo;t just let go of all of his responsibilities, he still gave his opinions on the drafts&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">This was a nasty can of worms he had tossed to Rigurdo, who undaunted was still happy to follow through with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hahaha, that&rsquo;s precisely my intent. So Myourmiles-dono, what type of thing are we talking here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">, such a nice guy. Even when he was having a hard time himself, he still wouldn&rsquo;t turn down his friend. Myourmiles was able to see through </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&rsquo;s personality within the short time he had spent with him, which is why his following request was tinged with remorse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ya&hellip; I&rsquo;m truly sorry for interrupting your busy schedule. I wanted to resolve it myself, but I do want to hear your opinion about this certain thing before making any decision. Also, this may require the consensus from every department.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oh? What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm, as a matter of fact&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Trying his best not to interrupt the busy </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Myourmiles thought to himself but regarding Rimuru&rsquo;s order this time, it was very hard to make the decision himself. The subject at hand&mdash;&ldquo;Construction of a salary system&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Sa-lary?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yes. To quote Rimuru-sama, &lsquo;I want to express gratitude towards everyone working in our country&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I see. We are already satisfied with basic fulfillments in food, clothes and residence. On top of that, Rimuru-sama has granted us meaningful work. We&rsquo;ll probably get struck by lightning if we ask for anything more. However, it would seem that humans have a different view on the subject.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rimuru, who </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;respected and loved, was said to once have been human. For that reason, </span><span class="c3">he granted them all rewards, due to</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;his values that differed from those of monsters. </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;nodded in agreement thinking so. Myourmiles agreed to that as well and added:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I personally also understand Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s intent. People tend to work extra hard upon receiving rewards for their work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm, I was thinking to shut the greedy ones up with my pair of fists&hellip; But I can&rsquo;t really get in the way of Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s idea. Then, how much would the appropriate salary be as a reward&hellip; hmm, this sure is a difficult question.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Honestly, we are rather sparing in finance right now. We can try to give out weekly funds as salary, but in the end, I&rsquo;m skeptical about how much of the funds everyone could spend in the first place&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Upon hearing Myourmiles&rsquo;s words, Rigurdo finally realized how profound the issue really was. Handing out a salary was a trivial task, yet to the monsters who had always practiced &ldquo;might makes right&rdquo;, the concept of monetary value was something wholly unfamiliar. Whenever they desired something, they could simply take it with brute force. That had been their way of life. Another factor was that monsters aren&rsquo;t as careful with and good at managing their money, as opposed to </span><span class="c3">scheming</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;merchants. At most a </span><span class="c3">handful</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;of them could even count their cash to begin with. At the time it was thanks to Rimuru&rsquo;s instructions that the population of people educated in those fields had increased. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Yet for the time being, most monsters were still </span><span class="c3">incapable</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of reading and writing. </span><span class="c3">Distributing a salary to them would have </span><span class="c3">been an ineffectual</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;endeavour</span><span class="c4 c3">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;If they are unable to utilize their salary, there would be no point in rewarding them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely the issue. Besides, if they simply save up their money without ever spending it, effectively taking it out of circulation, that may lead to stagnation in the economy. I would want to avoid that from happening.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Regardless of the good intentions they had when setting up the system, it would have no value if it </span><span class="c3 c14">only</span><span class="c3 c14">&nbsp;hindered the progress of the nation &mdash;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;That Myourmiles had such concerns proved his worth as a prescient </span><span class="c3">businessman</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;was able to understand Myourmiles&rsquo;s views, even on this complex subject. In fact, most people would likely save the salary out of appreciation.&nbsp;The wiser ones would consider what to do with the money. </span><span class="c3">Realistically, most monsters were already satisfied with their current situation and wouldn&rsquo;t know what else to buy</span><span class="c4 c3">. Besides, to them something given by Rimuru was already treasured beyond any sum of money. It would likely be more important to change their conceptions of things before we deliver the first paycheck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;was deep in thought. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hmm, this sure is a difficult question&hellip;&rdquo; </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;whispered to himself. It was also no easy job to consider the amount of payment for respective work loads, but before that, the educational issue must be resolved first. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;considered himself a fast-thinker, yet faced with Myourmiles&rsquo;s questions, his brain was running at full capacity. It would also be </span><span class="c3">preposterous</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;to go discuss the matter with Rimuru. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">This is really jarring</span><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;and Myourmiles looked at each other awkwardly and fell silent. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Kufufufufu, this sounds like an interesting topic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Diablo showed up out of nowhere, gave both a bright smile and inserted himself into their </span><span class="c3">discussion</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">That smile had </span><span class="c3">immediately</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;made Rigurdo </span><span class="c3">suspicious</span><span class="c4 c3">. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Unlike Benimaru, who was straightforward with his thoughts and would spit out whatever he thought, Diablo was very different. He was always planning something and cunningly twisted situations in his favor. This was especially the case when it concerned his own interests. If Diablo showed that level of interest, he was definitely scheming something. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">This look, he must have some devious idea on his mind! Diablo&rsquo;s got a good head. I won&rsquo;t give him a chance to trick me, I must stay focused!</span><span class="c3"><br></span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;steeled his resolve and turned to face Diablo. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well if it isn&rsquo;t Diablo-dono? I thought you were away enjoying your holiday?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;ve been </span><span class="c3">pursuing</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;chess-pieces that are going to work in my place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oh. How did that go?&rdquo; Myourmiles asked, and Diablo smoothly answered with a calm expression: &ldquo;They, of course, accepted the offer in a heartbeat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">This means I can focus entirely on being Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s secretary now</span><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;his expression said it all. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Although the part of &ldquo;in a heart-beat&rdquo; was questionable, Diablo definitely found some subordinates. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. Then, since you have overheard our conversation, Diablo-dono, what&rsquo;s your opinion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;delivered the line cautiously. He was determined to not be deceived. Handling Diablo wasn&rsquo;t easy for him though, and the slightest misstep would land him in the palm of Diablo&rsquo;s hand. Still, Diablo also showed much respect towards </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo&mdash;</span><span class="c4 c3">solely because both of them served the same master, Rimuru. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">If Rimuru ever disappears, Diablo would likely lose interest in this nation, right? But if it really comes down to that, the country would likely collapse on its own&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Kufufufufu. This salary needs not to be in cash, does it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hmm. I&rsquo;ve considered that point. However, </span><span class="c3">even if we decide to pay in goods, </span><span class="c3">it is time-consuming to learn </span><span class="c3">everyone&#39;s</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;preference. Issuing objects of no significance to the recipient would be meaningless. But it would also be unrealistic to hear everyone&rsquo;s demands&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Paying in goods removes the concern regarding them hoarding money, but this would be too costly. After all, every citizen already has a minimum welfare. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Myourmiles thusly dismissed the proposal as being unfeasible. <br>However, Diablo&rsquo;s smile remained. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No, no. You&rsquo;ve got the wrong idea. Think about it, haven&rsquo;t we already got a model? Right now, the canteen is using a point-system for ordering, right? What if we utilize the point-system again for this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">He made his proposal, staring at the two. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Speaking of points, do you mean the &ldquo;effort point&rdquo; that grants you access to the special menu?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;If I recall, it is an accumulative point-system to represent the work one does. Actually&hellip; I see! It&rsquo;s only a stamp issued by the department head, so it has nothing to do with money. Then there&rsquo;s no need to consider the stashing of cash nor do we need to investigate their personal preference. Hmm, this might be a good plan!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Before </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo could understand, </span><span class="c4 c3">Myourmiles began to show interest in the proposal and excitedly threw out one idea after another. Diablo was happily smiling as he listened. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Oya, have I been too cautious around Diablo-dono? I thought he wasn&rsquo;t interested in anything other than Rimuru-sama. It would seem he&rsquo;s also willing to lend a helping hand to others. I really shouldn&rsquo;t have judged others with prejudice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;reflected on himself&mdash;a really easily manipulated man. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">And so </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;was tossed aside while Myourmiles and Diablo entered deeper into discussion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;But the question being, how can we effectively utilize the point-system?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hmm. Let&rsquo;s not limit the </span><span class="c3">available rewards</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;to the special food menu, shall we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s most true. After all, there are monsters who are not particularly interested in food. </span><span class="c3">Under Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s influence, there are also quite a few who have developed a sweet tooth</span><span class="c4 c3">. We should also consider those who don&rsquo;t require food at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s most </span><span class="c3">likely</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;a blind-spot. Just as Diablo-dono said, there are ones uninterested in food. If we are to effectively apply the point-system, we should also compensate these members. What an amazing plan!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s really nothing. Rather, what should we prepare for the point exchange? That would be an important question, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Indeed, then what should we do&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;gradually caught up listening to their conversation. He was also amazed at Diablo&rsquo;s clever suggestion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Bravo Diablo-dono. No wonder he has the wisdom to fill the role of Rimuru&rsquo;s secretary. Aiya, it&rsquo;s my own short-comings that led me to question his intent. I&rsquo;ve got to improve on how I read others</span><span class="c3">&mdash;</span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;expressed his admiration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Then he began to weigh in on the discussion himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hmm, I believe some may be </span><span class="c3">amused</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;by Kurobee-dono&rsquo;s weapons and Shuna-sama&rsquo;s newly produced clothes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s for sure. If we are to sell the products to the public, how about we consider applying point based priority for purchases.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I see. In that sense, </span><span class="c3">Gobta</span><span class="c4 c3">&rsquo;s fishing rod may be a surprisingly popular item. After all, it&rsquo;s hand-made by Rimuru-sama. Then let Dold-dono make some similar gadgets with his crew.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That sounds great, I&rsquo;ve also fallen in love with the joy of fishing and wanted one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hahaha, then I should get you a test rod when the time </span><span class="c3">comes.</span><span class="c4 c3">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No, no, we should sell that as well. Please leave the matter to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than I could wish for. In that way, there&rsquo;s one more item on the list of specialties offered by our country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Hahaha, Whaha</span><span class="c3">; </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;and Myouriles gleefully exchanged their ideas. The two seemed highly motivated now that they seemingly found a solution to the headaching question. Diablo&rsquo;s smile didn&rsquo;t leave his face while observing the two. And suddenly, out of nowhere&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;The right to serve Rimuru-sama for a day, how about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Like a drop of poison, he </span><span class="c3">nonchalantly</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;slipped his opinion into their conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ha?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;couldn&rsquo;t utter a word while Myourmiles was so shocked that he suspected he had misheard Diablo. Diablo on the other hand calmly carried on with an explanation as if nothing happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s really not that big a deal. Similar to how Rimuru-sama wishes to appreciate us, we&rsquo;d also like to be grateful to Rimuru-sama, wouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;O-of course that&rsquo;s the case&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I-I also feel deeply grateful for being trusted and employed by Rimuru-sama&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that right? That&rsquo;s why we should allow everyone to compete fairly for the opportunity to express their heartfelt gratitude. But that&rsquo;s just my opinion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Indeed&mdash;Diablo exclaimed confidently. Myourmiles expression was frozen and </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;couldn&rsquo;t begin to agree. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No, but shouldn&rsquo;t Rimuru-sama consent to this as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Of course! That&rsquo;s without saying and only natural. However, if someone is to occupy Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s time, there should only be one person for a day per month to be given such an honor. In this way, the rarity of this reward will go up with fiercer competition. These </span><span class="c3">high-point rewards will surely ignite everyone&#39;s motivation</span><span class="c4 c3">.&rdquo;<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Hmm</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;whispered to himself. There was merit to Diablo&rsquo;s suggestion. However, there were still some unacceptable points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;H-however&hellip;to have Rimuru-sama greet us would be most disrespectful. And would it really be a reward if we are to serve Rimuru-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;expressed his doubts. Diablo, however, sighed in response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">-dono, please think it over. To serve Rimuru&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t that imply spending a day with him where it&rsquo;s just the two of you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;EH, HMMM?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;In other words, you get to see operas together, serve drinks to Rimuru-sama while he reads, dine together, and spend the day together!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;NA-NANI!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;We get to serve Rimuru-sama while simultaneously accepting Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s gratitude. How about it, isn&rsquo;t it a wonderful idea?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The demon conveyed his explanation smoothly. </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;reached a sudden realization&mdash;forced to being enlightened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It was </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&rsquo;s </span><span class="c3">naivety</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;that led to his failure. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Speaking of which, Myourmiles pondered:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">I already get to grab a drink and meal with Rimuru-sama quite often&hellip; If this were to go public, I&rsquo;d probably get envied. Hmm, so I&rsquo;ll just stay silent for now!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">A smart decision. A capable man is indeed different from others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">He didn&rsquo;t let anything slip before Diablo. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Then, Myourmiles began to assemble a draft regarding that matter and later submitted it to Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">Rimuru had been organizing documents in his room when Myourmiles handed him the files regarding the salary system. Diablo stood next to Rimuru and </span><span class="c3">helped organize the papers</span><span class="c4 c3">. He had resumed his role of No.2 Secretary as usual after his &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; ended a few days ago. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Wow, has it been completed, Myourmiles?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yes, we were able to finalize our proposal after putting much thought into it. As it states, we will not pay in cash but rather extended the more ideal point-system. But these are just my opinions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Myourmiles reported as such. Rimuru nodded happily in response. From that bright expression, one can see the remorse Rimuru had felt over not properly compensating his subordinates for all their work. Rimuru looked through the document and frowned upon seeing the top reward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm? Wh-what is this&hellip; the right to serve me&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Of course there would be doubts regarding it</span><span class="c4 c3">, Myourmiles thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;About the option of &lsquo;the right to serve Rimuru-sama&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s in accordance to Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s faith in everyone in the nation. I came up with it, believing that everyone working in this country would be most grateful towards Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Myourmiles had prepared his answers before the presentation. It wouldn&rsquo;t really be an issue if that one reward was taken out, therefore he was calm without a hint of panic. Diablo watched the entire thing while a small smile crept across his face.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;As I recall, it was a request from </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">-dono, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Heh, </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">? That guy is way too serious. There&rsquo;s really no need to worry about this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rimuru forced a smile upon hearing Diablo&rsquo;s words. It can be seen that Rimuru put much trust in </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">. If he was told that it was Diablo who came up with the proposal, Rimuru would probably have been more careful and discussed about it. But, hearing that it was what </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">thought</span><span class="c3">, Rimuru was easily </span><span class="c3">convinced</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;without paying it a second thought. Yet that was precisely Diablo&rsquo;s goal. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Kufufufufu, all according to my grand scheme</span><sup class="c3 c14"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c3 c14">! This privilege was the most vital from the start. It will probably get scrapped in no time, so I&rsquo;ll show you all who&rsquo;s number one when everyone </span><span class="c3 c14">else</span><span class="c3 c14">&nbsp;is just pretending to observe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Diablo snickered while revelling in his plot. It was precisely because only Diablo would do something like this that </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;was wary of him. It was something that would eventually happen even without the person noticing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm, however, it&rsquo;s probably not wise to use all the points they earned through hard work on me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Rimuru still had some objections, so Myourmiles responded:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&hellip;Indeed, it&rsquo;s exactly as you say. However, everyone who&rsquo;s discussed about the proposal had nothing but praise to say about it. What&rsquo;s more, if someone decides to exchange their points for it even though the price is high, it would show how much gratitude they feel towards Rimuru-sama. If someone makes that choice, it&rsquo;s a completely voluntary action. So I think we should wait and see how everyone reacts to it first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm, is that so? It certainly seems like it with everything you just said. Well I suppose it&rsquo;s fine, since they won&rsquo;t be able to collect that many points again in a short time span. Let&rsquo;s wait and see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Then would you agree to the proposal?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Rimuru gave up thinking and decided to approve the proposal. And so it gained Rimuru&rsquo;s approval.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash; Diablo struck a victory pose in secret, no one noticed.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Then, two months later&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Aiyi, </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">. It&rsquo;s nice of you to have proposed &lsquo;the right to serve me&rsquo;, but we should probably cancel it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rimuru </span><span class="c3">summoned</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;to tell him this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ha, Eh? What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Somehow the proponent turned from Diablo to himself. </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;had many doubts, but he hid them for the time and asked Rimuru the reasons behind it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;As a matter of fact, it&rsquo;s Diablo who first obtained the right. And it&rsquo;s him this month again. It would seem that he has been collecting points behind my back. If we carry on, I feel that every </span><span class="c3">privilege</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;will end up in his pocket,&rdquo; Rimuru answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">I&rsquo;ve been PLAYED like a DAMN FIDDLE!? So it&rsquo;s true, I should never have believed that demon!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Feeling like the sky was </span><span class="c3">falling</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;down, </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;realized that he had been completely </span><span class="c3">duped</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;by Diablo. It would seem that Diablo had even considered the abolishment of the right in his plan. In other words, once the situation devolved into this, that right would be placed on a pedestal and regarded as a </span><span class="c3">dream-privilege</span><span class="c4 c3">, further adding to its value. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The impossibility in obtaining &ldquo;the right to serve Rimuru-sama&rdquo;&mdash;and the only one who was allowed to exercise the right had been Diablo, and him alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">His plan was executed flawlessly.<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Wuuu, I&rsquo;m still too na&iuml;ve. </span><span class="c24 c3 c14">It all started with that damn smile;</span><span class="c3 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c14">I had already seen through his cunning nature yet still lost to his tricks.</span><span class="c4 c3"><br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Such regrets hardly mattered at that point. In the end, as </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;anticipated, &ldquo;the right to serve Rimuru-sama&rdquo; became a fantasy. What remained were many monsters&rsquo; envy and complaints.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As well as </span><span class="c3">Rigurdo</span><span class="c4 c3">&rsquo;s regret.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">However, this did not happen for nothing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Another reward-based point-system was adopted regarding the salary problem in Tempest. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">A more complete and detailed structure was built.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash; That was the inside story of the salary issue during Tempest&rsquo;s early independence, when the kingdom still lacked a complete national system.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c27 c12"><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Back to Table of Contents</a></span></p><a id="id.1y810tw"></a><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c15">Goddess of the Ever-night Kingdom</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">(Spoiler for Light Novel Volume 8)</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 325.27px; height: 499.81px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 325.27px; height: 499.81px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">My name is </span><span class="c3">Ruminas.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Ruminas Valentine. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Ruler of the old world&mdash;Vampire.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I was the one at the top of the food chain, Queen of Nightmare. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash; However, politics are truly troublesome and upsetting to me. I needed only to pose as though I&rsquo;m being thoughtful and nod in agreement. <br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">That being the case, it would be </span><span class="c3">sufficient</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;to have subordinates deal with it in my stead. In more ancient times, I acquired Gunther&mdash;the king of an opposing force&mdash;under my reign. It was definitely the right choice. Gunther has freed me from my duty and built up a system of ruling. Even though he would complain at times, all of our accomplishments have been dependent on him. And for that alone, my kingdom prospers.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Yet even so, I still get shit from that fucking lizard (Veldora). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">If I hadn&rsquo;t met Chloe at the time, there would have been hell to pay. Just thinking about it makes me feel appreciation for Chloe beyond words. And of course for Hinata as well, who was within Chloe. I&rsquo;ve treated them both as true friends from that point onward. While I may act as though there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the two of them, it&rsquo;s not actually the case. I have some complaints regarding both of them. For instance, their description of events is unspecific, to say the least.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yeah, there&rsquo;s about to be a huge earthquake&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">So I was warned.

At first, I thought it was unclear due to her memories being blurry. But then I realized&mdash;Chloe was doing it on purpose. She has no intention to prevent any disaster from happening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Chloe is a kind person. Yet why would someone as kind as Chloe not try to prevent crises while knowing all about them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">My suspicion solidified with every following unnatural result that occurred. </span><span class="c3">Assessing the aftermath of each disaster revealed that the number of casualties was reduced</span><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;she disclosed bits of information to me while deliberately hiding key details. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">So why would Chloe do such things?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">She claims to know the future and I believe her when she says this. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because I didn&rsquo;t question any of her words that I now find myself disgruntled&hellip; It should be a friend&rsquo;s duty, my duty, to be considerate of what she thinks. And that&rsquo;s when I reached a conclusion. <br>Chloe doesn&rsquo;t wish to change the future. To be more precise, it&rsquo;s to ensure she walks the path she was familiar with and wanted to happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to at least share her real thoughts with me</span><span class="c4 c3">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">That&rsquo;s what bothers me about her. Despite this, we shared a very close relationship. We&rsquo;ve gotten to know each other heart to heart, having spent more than a thousand years together. And above all it was a real joy for me when she gave that goddamn Veldora a fierce thrashing. Sadly such wonderful days I lived with her suddenly came to an end.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;As a matter of fact, Ruminas, I&mdash;I may be disappearing soon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well, it may be a little exaggerated to say I&rsquo;m disappearing. It&rsquo;s more like falling asleep. However, Hinanta would still remain for a while, so you could say it&rsquo;s a personality swap.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Personality swap&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I was plunged into turmoil when Chloe broke the news to me out of the </span><span class="c3">blue. </span><span class="c4 c3">This was another one of Chloe&rsquo;s bad habits. She knows too much herself and always fails to explain things properly because of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Afterwards, I got to know the details from her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I reached some level of understanding from her after I inquired into future events. It would seem by the time Chloe visits this world, due to the existence of multiple Chloes</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">, the consciousness of the current version would thus disappear. Thereupon Hinata&rsquo;s personality would take her place. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">That&rsquo;s about how it works. That would be fine, but a problem arose thereafter. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;So, in another three hundred years, wouldn&rsquo;t it be time for Hinata&rsquo;s consciousness to disappear?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm, it would probably be the case.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I understand. When that time comes, I shall personally seal you up with my power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Rather than being sentimental about Chloe&rsquo;s disappearance, what followed had to be carefully considered. It would be fine as long as Hinata stuck around, but it seems she will disappear eventually as well. Should that come to pass, I question what would happen to the remaining Chloe. <br>According to her speculation, she will undoubtedly lose control. Within Chloe, there seems to dwell a &ldquo;broken consciousness&rdquo; (Chronoa) that knows the future. If that consciousness awakes, it will likely take over as the third personality and rain destruction upon the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">That was truly a troublesome issue I got informed of. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">But I will do what I can for my friend&rsquo;s sake. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I suspected that some important elements had deliberately been tweaked or left out by Chloe and Hinata. I would still choose to trust them nonetheless. <br></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">This is a disaster! </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">This isn&rsquo;t just some slight adjustment, things went completely different from what I was told. No, if it was altogether completely different I would have just given up on trusting the narrative. But everything had been the same up until Hinata&rsquo;s arrival. But after that, after the appearance of the slime named Rimuru, things went completely off the rails. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Rimuru-san is a magnificent individual as well as my benefactor. But a lot will happen and the situation would develop to the point where Hinata and Rimuru-san confront each other, so Ruminas, you must not intervene.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Keeping my promise, I decided to observe for the time being. Yet the chaos had no end. The one who took the initiative was Hinata. </span><span class="c3">Nonetheless</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;I was reassured. From what I heard from Chloe, the battle at Ingracia Kingdom could be avoided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">But&hellip;how did this develop to the point that Rimuru is deliberating waging battle against Hinata?</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash;Due to the conspiracy in Farmus, the surrounding council states will reach the consensus to have Hinata lead an army and confront Tempest Federation. At that time, Hinata and Rimuru will be able to reach an agreement and achieve peace&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"><br>Or so I was told, but as soon as Rimuru and Hinata finished their battle, I was able to confirm that nothing I&rsquo;d heard held any credibility. In that moment, I had a bad feeling </span><span class="c3">about the</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;future. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">And that premonition became a reality.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash;Rimuru became a demon lord&mdash;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Farmus Kingdom waged war on its own and was eliminated without survivors. It is rumored that they were devastated as a result of Veldora&rsquo;s resurrection, but that is also questionable.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Moreover, the issue at hand was Rimuru who had become a demon lord. In the following Walpurgis Banquet we were to discuss what to do with the self-proclaimed demon lord, Rimuru. In light of this entire situation I felt it </span><span class="c3">necessary</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to </span><span class="c3">attend, deciding</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;to participate in disguise as a maid. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Even though it wasn&rsquo;t foretold to happen in the future, I didn&rsquo;t try to get on Rimuru&rsquo;s bad side. I would&rsquo;ve been fine with that outcome, but it would be bad if I hurt Chloe&rsquo;s heart in that way. If anything, I could even take him under my protection&mdash;I observed the development of the banquet with that in mind. <br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Rimuru turned out to be an unexpectedly impressive individual. He didn&rsquo;t cower in front of all of the demon lords and was able to state his opinions righteously. On that basis, he deliberately provoked Clayman and led things in favour of his side, dominating the situation. It was an admirable display, but I was also concerned for him, since I wasn&rsquo;t sure how things would develop. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">By the end, Rimuru was officially recognized as a demon lord and became a part of the &lsquo;Eight Star Demon Lords (Octagram)&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Then that other guy exposed my identity so casually, ruining my plan of passing the name of </span><span class="c3">&lsquo;Demon Lord&rsquo;</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;to Roy. Now I had to be crowned the title again in such a graceless manner. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">This is giving me a headache</span><span class="c4 c3">, so I thought&mdash;But it really couldn&rsquo;t be helped. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Every, single, problem was CAUSED BY THAT EVIL DRAGON!</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">My suffering continued well after the unrest at the Walpurgis Banquet concluded. That same fateful night, Roy, whom I entrusted the title of &lsquo;Demon Lord&rsquo;, was murdered. And without leaving me time to marvel, Hinata set out to make peace with Rimuru. I agreed it would be bad to antagonize Rimuru, so I decided to keep an eye on how things would develop&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Too dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Hinata stepped right into a trap and almost got killed. Had I not intervened, things would&#39;ve seriously gone south. A group that had slipped to the back of my mind returned to the fore, it was the &ldquo;Seven Celestial Saints&rdquo;, who&rsquo;s conspiracy had just been unveiled. The head of the group, Gran, instigated their betrayal.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It resulted in another layer of dissatisfaction in regard to Chloe. Hinata and Rimuru fought and, at last, reconciled as companions&mdash;at least according to Chloe, who neither explained why there was a second battle, nor did she ever mentioned Gran&rsquo;s betrayal. Current events diverged significantly from the future Chloe foretold&mdash;or is that simply what she wishes me to think? Perhaps there was a reason for it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It is beyond me to draw a conclusion from everything that&rsquo;s been going on. I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see my friends Chloe and Hinata now anyway. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Regardless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Rimuru&#39;s misunderstanding involving Hinata was resolved and I was able to set things right with him. I had some qualms about getting personally involved at the battlefield, but things seemed to have worked out fine.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">By the way, I got to exact revenge on Veldora. The sight of Veldora crying brought me tremendous joy. He&rsquo;s also different from before&mdash;not causing havoc everywhere he goes. I&rsquo;m downright surprised seeing it, and even more so, learning that he&rsquo;s actually listening to other people. Now that&rsquo;s a shocker.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I&rsquo;ve honestly begun to question my eyes seeing him follow Rimuru&rsquo;s orders like a puppy. Could this be part of the future Chloe foresaw? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">For every time I grumbled about Veldora, she unfailingly wore a look that expressed a desire to reveal something. It would seem that Hinata within Chloe held a bitter grudge towards him. In spite of this, she didn&rsquo;t deem Veldora to be evil incarnate requiring extermination. And that austere Hinata with her strong sense of justice has probably forgiven Veldora by now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Even so, they did give him a solid beat-down when sealing him, presumably allowing her to vent that anger. Either way, the current version of Veldora wasn&rsquo;t that annoying after all, or so I thought. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Since history unfolded differently from the predictions, it allowed me to become acquainted with Rimuru. Though considering it in a different light, it was a stroke of luck. Not only are we both members of the &lsquo;Eight Star Demon Lords (Octagram)&rsquo;, we also got a chance to talk directly. I was determined to make the most of the opportunity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Rimuru declared he would be hosting a feast celebrating the reconciliation, and before that he brought us to the bath house. A bathhouse&mdash;it&rsquo;s where maids fill the tub with water and help me scrub my body, right? Metabolism is unnecessary for my body, so there&rsquo;s no need to bathe. Still, I enjoy it as a symbol of luxury.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At least that was my impression, but what awaited me when we reached the bathhouse defied my expectations entirely. There was a spacious pool, large enough for dozens of people. In fact, there is even hot water pouring into the pool from polished stone tubs. I also saw tubs fashioned from aromatic wood and heated rooms where you could warm up in the hot air.</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Wh-what is this&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;This, hot spring&hellip;? And there are sauna and everything. That man really does whatever comes to his mind&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I was shocked by the unfamiliar facilities; Hinanta, who came along, was surprised in a different sense. The variety of infrastructures all seemed familiar to her, explaining them to me as we bathed.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c3">I see. So Rimuru has recreated the facilities familiar to him in this world, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That is the case. I&rsquo;m quite surprised by the facilities on the streets, but they are nothing compared to this. I wonder how much labor and funds were invested to build something this amazing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;At the end of the day, Rimuru is a newly risen demon lord. If he chooses to command all of his monsters, such feats are probably a piece of cake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That may be the case&hellip;but I still can&rsquo;t really accept it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Hinata seemed frustrated by it. That&rsquo;s to be expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">For the longest time, Hinata has fought vigorously in an effort to improve the standard of living for our people. Although the seeds of her hard work have started to sprout, it will take many more years before any of its fruits will be borne. </span><span class="c4 c3">On the other hand, these achievements are so casually displayed in Rimuru&rsquo;s country. So it can&rsquo;t be helped that Hinata was unable to enjoy it. <br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">However.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This bathhouse was really nice. I have to admit that. </span><span class="c4 c3">After all, I got to savor Hinata&rsquo;s beautiful nude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It was a feast for my eyes&mdash;her body without a single piece of clothing on it. Her tight waist and alluring, curved hips drew me in. Her luscious pair of fruits proudly presented themselves, giving me the scenery of my life. A beauty worthy of being a piece of art, mesmerizing whoever even catches a glimpse. Her pale white skin, smooth as newly fallen snow, with a pinch of cherry red. It&rsquo;s all thanks to Rimuru&rsquo;s recreation of a hot spring bath, that I am now able to justifiably appreciate Hinata&#39;s dazzling form. If I get to spend joyful hours like this, I should build a bathhouse in my country as well&mdash;I made up my mind in secret. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ah, this is heaven.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm, indeed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I mean, you don&rsquo;t have to be so alerted. Rimuru won&rsquo;t do annoying things like spying on us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c3">So, there&rsquo;s no need to enable &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo; everywhere,&rdquo; Hinata laughed at me.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">That was close, that was close&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I was solely focused on appreciating her naked body, but instead that got mistaken for something else. &ldquo;Hmm-ummm, yeah,&rdquo; I responded, reluctantly deactivating &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">After the bath, it was time for a feast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Before my eyes lay dishes I&rsquo;d never seen before. Also, a new challenge awaited me among them. There were two cylindrical sticks placed near my hands&mdash;the utensils known as &ldquo;chopsticks&rdquo;. I heard they were used in the east and the Eastern Empire, but it&rsquo;s my first time seeing a pair. In other words, I&rsquo;ve got no idea how to use them. Actually, I do know how they&rsquo;re used, but I&rsquo;m not confident in my ability to wield them properly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Ruminas, who is perfect in whatever she does, is clueless when using chopsticks</span><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;I can&rsquo;t let such rumors spread. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Moreover, Veldora is here as well. If I were to mess up in front of him, god knows what type of shenanigans he would pull on me. If he dares to pull a smirking &ldquo;pu-hehe&rdquo; at me, I&rsquo;ll blow my lid and start a brawl. In order to prevent such an outburst, I&rsquo;ll have to overcome the challenge at hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I was racking my brain for a solution while trying to maintain composure. </span><span class="c4 c3">And then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well, let us raise our cups for the courageous battles fought by everyone here, cheers!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Rimuru&rsquo;s word set the feast in motion.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">There were a variety of steamy, delicious-looking dishes, and a golden drink was poured into my crystal clear glass. I&rsquo;m something of a gourmet myself, so at a glance, I could tell each dish possessed top-notch quality. In this type of circumstance, proper etiquette is of utmost importance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">My social awareness engaged and I reflexively lifted my glass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Down it went.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Observe the others around me while taking a drink. That should give me time to come up with some great plan&mdash;I took a sip and thought it over.</span><span class="c4 c3"><br>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;This is really tasty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Somehow that slipped out of my mouth, but it&rsquo;s undoubtedly my honest opinion. The cooling sensation glided down my throat elegantly. It was a refreshing experience unknown to me, someone who possesses extensive knowledge about wines. The Holy Knights attending alongside me shared my surprise about this fine wine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Huu, it&rsquo;s cold. Could this be beer?</span><span class="c4 c19 c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s alright I guess. It took me some effort to recreate it and it&rsquo;s on-par with what I drank in Japan. It&rsquo;s quite similar you know.</span><span class="c4 c19 c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Is that so? This may be the first time I&rsquo;m drinking this, but I don&rsquo;t find it particularly tasty. Though compared to the beer in this world, I&rsquo;d definitely drink this over that stuff.</span><span class="c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Hinata expressed her thoughts to Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">This reminds me, It&rsquo;s what she said back when Hinata, an underage student at the time, arrived in this world. I taught her how to drink when she claimed she&rsquo;d never tried any alcohol.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">How would a drunk Hinata lose her style? I was hoping to see that&hellip; But then she dropped the line &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t even taste that nice&rdquo; and showed no signs of getting drunk. Rather than having a tough body, she probably just gained Poison Resistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">You say that because you are not used to it. I also thought that beer wasn&rsquo;t all that nice in the beginning. But then I started frequenting a small pub after work&hellip; One ought to get a glass of beer after work&mdash;I just gradually fell into that mindset.</span><span class="c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Hmm, is that so? I&rsquo;ve only drunken warm beer around here, and wine tastes sour so I really find them both pretty average.</span><span class="c4 c19 c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve got a kid&#39;s sense of taste. Okay, I concede that warm beer is bland, but good wines are out there. Like the ones served during the Walpurgis Banquet, it was surprisingly tasty&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Of course they were; whatever gets served there had to be approved by Guy. Hence it would be unthinkable for something not to be exquisite.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Is that so? But how would I know if it&rsquo;s true without tasting it myself?</span><span class="c4 c19 c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">I suppose that&rsquo;s how it works. However, that luxurious stuff won&rsquo;t come so easily. Or rather, for Hinata-chan who&rsquo;s got a kid&rsquo;s tongue, here&rsquo;s probably a drink better suited for you.</span><span class="c4 c19 c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">You&rsquo;ve been going on and on about the whole &ldquo;kid&rsquo;s tongue&rdquo; thing from just now, are you looking down on me?</span><span class="c4 c19 c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">NO, MOST CERTAINLY NOT, LADY.</span><span class="c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Hinata glared at Rimuru, who&rsquo;d prepared a fragrant fruit liqueur. Something resembling juice&mdash;or so I thought; on second glance I discovered that it actually had a remarkably high alcohol content.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">How dare you give me drinks for kids&mdash;&mdash;eh? This is pretty good.</span><span class="c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">And with clever phrasing Rimuru was able to recommend another drink to Hinata. Hinata, who&rsquo;d been kept in a loop, got tricked by the sweet flavor and started to get drunk soon enough. Hinata, unlike her usual strict self, showed signs of crapulence (intoxication) on her reddening face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">ARE YOU A GENIUS?!!&mdash;&mdash; I was deeply shocked by Rimuru&rsquo;s strategizing side. He cleverly got Hinata to dance in the palm of his hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Perhaps it was because I had lowered my guard out of respect for Rimuru, that I reached out to the dishes in front of me with my bare hands. I completely forgot about the chopstick business and simply grabbed the food with my fingers. I was astonished, immediately turning my attention from Rimuru and Hinata to the dishes. The crispy taste, accompanied by a thick and lasting scrumptious taste that spread throughout my mouth after one bite.</span><span class="c4 c3">Is this what they call Tempura? It was truly tasty for a first try. And they&rsquo;ve prepared napkins, so I need not mind dirtying my fingers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I was satisfied with such a long overdue dinning of fine food and reached out for my glass. I want to try the fruit drink Hinata just tasted. Now I see why it&rsquo;s so tasty. Its aroma is uncanny, a sweetness that spreads in your mouth as you take a sip. It&rsquo;s obvious to me they have not spared the use of honey and sugar in making it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Ruminas-sama, I also recommend this one,</span><span class="c8">&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c3">said the kijin named Shuna, as she handed me a clear glass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Hmm, then I shall taste it.</span><span class="c4 c19 c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Very well,</span><span class="c8">&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c3">she poured some mouthwatering, colorless fluid into it. A fragrance reminiscent of the gifts of the forest filled the air around me. What a unique scent&hellip; I swallowed my saliva and carefully maintained my elegant behavior, then passed the glass to my mouth. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;This is delicious!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s neither sweet or bitter. </span><span class="c4 c3">A pure and elegant taste.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Your kind words are greatly appreciated. There is an abundant supply of it, please help yourself to any amount you desire.</span><span class="c4 c19 c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Hmm, I shall do just that,</span><span class="c8">&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c3">I responded with glee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I had not expected that a newly appointed demon lord could have provided such a comprehensive reception. And somehow without prior contact, they&rsquo;ve managed to prepare such a feast&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">In other words, they&rsquo;ve always been leading such a comfortable life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I thought about it as I devoured the last of the delicious food and drink.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Are our meals to your taste?</span><span class="c4 c19 c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Hmm, very much so. The dishes and drinks are all spectacular.</span><span class="c8">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Rimuru came to make small talk with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That would be great. However, you should probably know your limit, or it would be harmful for your health.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Stop being silly. No poison can affect me so how would I ever lose to alcohol. Or rather, I have to weaken my poison resistance in order to </span><span class="c4 c3">get intoxicated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I was rather delighted having been able to speak my mind without the need for courtesy. That may be why I wasn&rsquo;t stingy about teaching Rimuru the secret of controlling his skills</span><span class="c3">.</span><sup class="c3 c30"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Just like that, I was able to build an alliance with Rimuru as well as having a friendly relationship. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">But that&rsquo;s just where the problem begins. The future I&rsquo;ve heard of has been drastically different from the situation as of now. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Rimuru shouldn&rsquo;t have become a demon lord and Farmus Kingdom should have survived. The Holy Kingdom of Ruberios should not have an alliance with the Jura-Tempest Federation, only to the extent that Hinata was an acquaintance of Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">And then, in many years, when the Eastern Empire begins its invasion, Rimuru would be murdered. As a result, the sealed Veldora would be resurrected, and I along with whoever remained, would risk our lives to challenge the unleashed, berserk Veldora&mdash;Or so it should have been.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Right now, everything is different. So whatever happens next becomes more difficult to predict.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">However, however.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">There is one thing I am sure of. Hinata is still around and she got to know Rimuru. It wouldn&rsquo;t take long before I get to meet Chloe again this way.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">My prediction was right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Chloe has already visited this world, and I was able to meet her again during the opening festival. Though Chloe doesn&rsquo;t remember me&mdash;or I should say, pretended to not know me. Although I can&rsquo;t bear to wait, it can not be helped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I really want to hug Chloe tight as soon as possible, but right now I must endure. But Compared to that, a more pressing matter would be the impending judgement day. This is a future that has derailed from its original course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Seeing Veldora being tamed by Rimuru, I couldn&rsquo;t imagine him going berserk the way he is now. If that&rsquo;s the case, there will probably be disaster of a different kind befalling us. Then I&rsquo;ll have to be cautious with my every move.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I made up my mind on that closing thought. I will keep my promise. And then&mdash;truly reunite with Chloe and Hinata. I&rsquo;ll call Rimuru as well on that occasion. Thinking about it, I&rsquo;m also looking forward to the promised musical exchange with Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I&rsquo;ll defy my fate no matter what happens in the near future. Then, I&rsquo;ll put an end to the lonesome days. By that time, it will be my world to reign over. For instance, how about I invite Hinata and Chloe to get bathed together?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">I dream of such day&rsquo;s arrival. I&rsquo;ll put mirrors all over the bathhouse to surround Hinata and Chloe from every conceivable angle &mdash; Muhuhuhuhu, I can barely contain myself.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Since I&rsquo;ve made a commitment, it&rsquo;s time to rid myself of all the annoying burdens. Wipe out anyone and anything in my way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">With such resolve, I look forward to my future paradise.</span></p><p class="c27 c12"><span class="c26 c35 c29"><a class="c17" href="#id.gjdgxs">Back to Table of Contents</a></span></p><a id="id.4i7ojhp"></a><p class="c11"><span class="c15">The Lakeshore Dyed Scarlet Incident</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 292.53px; height: 416.57px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 292.53px; height: 416.57px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c16"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">There once was a small nation named Silberia.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">A province state with less than ten thousand inhabitants under the rule of the Eastern Sovereign Alliance of Nasca Namrium Ulmeria Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It had no signature industry, nor special attractions.

A princess loved by her people.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This is &mdash; the tragic story surrounding Princess Blanche.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Blanche was a shy yet short-tempered girl. She inherited her mother&rsquo;s beautiful silver white hair and her red eyes that symbolized Silberia&#39;s royal lineage. She was a cute girl, skin white as snow, with a passion for books, and a late bloomer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">On top of that, she possessed magicule none could rival. She perceived things people don&rsquo;t normally see, an intrinsic trait of the royal bloodline&#39;s heirs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Even though Blanche was that kind of child, she lived a comfortable life, embraced by the loving care of her mother Letitia.</span><sup class="c3 c30"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Very few people were aware of this special ability passed down in the royal family, but thankfully everyone within the family knew how to deal with these special kids.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Heed me now, Blanche. You must never tell other people about the things only you can see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;For doing so will only make people fear you.

How cute you are, my </span><span class="c3">Blanc</span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanche swore from the bottom of her heart while staring into Letitia&rsquo;s golden pupils. She kept that promise to her mother ever since. And thanks to that, no one was ever scared of her, and she was able to grow up in good care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Although she was rather shy, her uncanny beauty from a young age made her quite popular among the servants. Such was Blanche&rsquo;s happy childhood, being loved by everyone.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanche&rsquo;s happy days were not for long. Blanche had just reached ten years of age; the balance of power within the palace&rsquo;s harem was toppled. Blanche&rsquo;s mother, who was the most adored first princess, was in fact from a viscount&rsquo;s family of lowly origin. The snobbish nobles had conspired to urge the king to marry a second princess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The one who got selected was a woman named Emilia,</span><sup class="c3 c30"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;born from a marquis&rsquo; family. While still serving as a concubine, Emilia had already given birth to a daughter to the king. For that very reason she was selected as the new princess. Had it been a son, she would have been on the throne long ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Emilia, as a high-ranking noble, was keenly aware of the intrigue and conflicts within the harem. She </span><span class="c3">seized</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;control of the palace where Blanche and Letitia resided in little time. Blanche&rsquo;s nannies as well the maids who cared much for her were all dismissed for fabricated reasons. None had the </span><span class="c3">audacity</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;to defy the second princess, and the servants relegated to the harem no longer obeyed the king, but her. And as a result, Blanche and her mother were treated poorly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">In stark contrast, Blanche&rsquo;s sister Ashla&mdash;who was less than a year older&mdash;received affectionate care as the second young princess. Everything was according to Emilia&rsquo;s plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The king had no </span><span class="c3">siblings</span><span class="c3">, granting Blanche the first right of succession. If the second princess Emilia was to </span><span class="c3">conceive</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;a prince, he would&rsquo;ve been guaranteed the throne. Even if that failed, there was still Ashla. And if Blanche ceased to exist, the royal claim would fall into Ashla&rsquo;s hands, leaving her to be crowned as the next queen of Silberia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">For that, I just have to deal with the meddling mother and daughter in my way&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The ambitious Emilia resorted to far crueler, clandestine tactics in order to advance her blood to the throne.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">A fateful winter day. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">On Blanche&rsquo;s </span><span class="c3">twelfth</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;birthday, her mother the first princess passed away. A blanket of snow cloaked the courtyard. Blanche hid and sobbed alone in a corner no one could see. To Blanche, her father, the king, was a distant figure. And now she had no left to be called a family. Blanche could only cry, feeling utter </span><span class="c3">despair</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;and sorrow. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Suddenly, someone called out to the weeping Blanche.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Why are you crying?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanche raised her head to see the source of the voice. It was a breathtaking sight; someone with beauty beyond humans. No, it was a non-human existence that only Blanche could see. However, at the time it mattered not to Blanche, whether the individual was human or not. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;How beautiful&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanche opened her heart to the beauty that could drive out anyone&rsquo;s sadness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">She even forgot about her promise to her mother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Such was the incredible impact of this beauty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ho, thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Perhaps she had sensed Blanche&rsquo;s sincerity. A smile emerged on her emotionless face, an extraordinarily destructive smile. A beauty that drove away even the falling snow. Her long hair floated in the wind, a more brilliant white than the snowflakes. Sharing Blanche&rsquo;s red pupils, a deep scarlet, more vivid than blood. With skin that was an immaculate white, nigh transparent. Her dark dress, as if to obscure this brilliance, concealed her body. An existence beyond human realms. Whoever laid their eyes, be they as special as her&rsquo;s or not, upon this beauty would find that she transcended humans&rsquo; very grasp. Such a beautiful female smiled towards Blanche.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;My mother passed away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Is that so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve become an abandoned child. My Father too has abandoned me, he cares only for my sister Ash. My life no longer holds meaning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;At least, I need you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">That sentence was gospel for Blanche. Whatever this non-human&rsquo;s intentions may have been, it no longer mattered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Because you can see me. Your white hair, red eyes, are the same as mine. They are gorgeous, and will only grow prettier as you thrive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Big sister, do you really need me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Her angelic words meant salvation to Blanche. And she continued without pause.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I really like you. And so I shall grant you any wish you desire. But I would also like you to hear my request.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. If it&rsquo;s a request from my big sister, I will work hard to make it a reality.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Never conform to the words of non-humans.</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;It was a bit of advice her mother often repeated. But Blanche nodded without hesitation; she had been taken in by this beautiful, kind woman; this non-human that spoke the words she needed the most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Besides, Blanche&rsquo;s instinct told her to trust the woman.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my good child. Then, let me tell you my request. I would wish to borrow your body. </span><span class="c8">I am only spiritually present, so</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;I wish to possess your body.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The non-human existence exhibited no intention of hiding her motives, having elegantly expressed her true desire. This non-human, invisible to human eyes, belonged to the most terrifying existences among all monsters&mdash;the demon race. Moreover, demons of the rank Greater Demon&mdash;No, not only those, this was an existence which even the ancient demons, so called Dominator class were bound to serve. The king among demons, one of the so called &ldquo;Primordials&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Seven Primordials&rdquo; have names based upon the characteristics of their appearance&mdash;namely colours. Unbelievably, her colour is similar to Blanche&rsquo;s name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Primordial Blanc.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Of course, this was no coincidence. This land, Silberia, had been her domain since time immemorial. And according to the ancient pact formed with the ruler of this land, she adjusted for dozens of centuries before a vessel of flesh used to accommodate her mind would be born. Until the birth of her ideal vessel, she would protect the land. This was the content of the pact. And the special physique of the royal family was testament to it. The red eyes of the Silberia royal family were her blessing. She upheld the covenant and protected the land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">This was the real reason&mdash;why Silberia, despite being a province state, was able to retain sovereignty while within the grasp of the Eastern Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">And the body Blanc was satisfied with&mdash;was precisely the young Blanche. Primordial Blanc always kept her promises. The ancient pact formed with the first queen of this kingdom was kept to that day. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">When a young girl with silver white hair and red pupils is born, Primordial Blanc shall take over its body upon fulfilling this girl&rsquo;s wish</span><span class="c4 c3">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It was a pact upheld for many generations, allowing its effects to compound, presumably to grant Primordial Blanc the perfect vessel. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">And the day of the promise had arrived.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Twelve years of age, in ancient times this was deemed the day one matured to adulthood, and Primordial Blanc decided to talk to Blanche. She had deemed Blanche an adult capable of making her own decisions, capable of negotiating with others on equal ground. This was also invoked from the ancient pact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Typical of most demons&rsquo; personality, they would cunningly induce others to sign one-sided pacts. Yet for someone of Primordial Blanc&rsquo;s stature, there was no need for such trickery. She thought those would only dishonor the pact. Solely through loyally fulfilling a reasonable pact, would the body be Primordial Blanc&rsquo;s righteous asset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Therefore, she would fulfill any wish made by Blanche, to the best of her abilities. That was why, even if Blanche refused her, she wouldn&rsquo;t have given up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Human beings are creatures driven by insatiable desire, and there will always come a day they carry a wish. She needed only to be patient and await that day&rsquo;s arrival. That was why Blanche&rsquo;s answer came as a surprise</span><span class="c3 c24">&nbsp;for sure, but a welcome one</span><span class="c4 c3">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Would you&hellip;like to be my friend?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;Ayy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give my body to you, big sister. Then please be my friend! W-will you not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Primordial Blanc was taken aback. This was a first for her, even throughout the many eons she had lived. Reflected in Blanche&rsquo;s eyes was still that beautiful face, yet her heart had been greatly troubled by what just transpired.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Did she just say she wants to be friends with me? Okay now what am I supposed to do&hellip; Even for someone&rsquo;s bad joke on their deathbed, this wasn&rsquo;t funny. Plus, this is supposed to be some damning ravings, yet I don&rsquo;t really feel pissed about it&hellip; And it seems quite interesting, in fact, that girl as well. This girl in front of me may allow me to have some fun. I could spare some time with her since human lives are cheap anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Despite its subtlety, Primordial Blanc flashed a rare look of confusion. But she quickly reached a conclusion in her heart. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Very well. From now on, you and I shall be friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanche blushed upon hearing this, her crying face lit up with a big smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ehehe, I&rsquo;m so happy! Please take care of me in the future, big sister!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hmm, I will now latch onto you. Let&rsquo;s have a good time </span><span class="c3">together.</span><span class="c4 c3">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Then, Primordial Blanc possessed Blanche&rsquo;s body. On that day, the fate of the kingdom of Silberia rested on the young Blanche&rsquo;s shoulders, yet no one was ever to find out about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Blanche grew up to fifteen years of age.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Although Blanche still got the cold shoulder within the harem, that being a dark and cold place for her, as soon as she left it behind, the whole palace&rsquo;s view of Blanche began improving by the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Princess Blanche is such a genius. Her elegant actions and attitude are perfect no matter how you see it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s well versed in History, art and mathematics. Even geography and sociology. The amount of knowledge she possesses is commendable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;More importantly, her theory of magic is fantastic! Her analysis of spells does not have a single unnecessary line and she&rsquo;s able to improve her magical efficiency through simplification of spells. This level of talent is beyond genius, what an outstanding princess!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The royal tutors appointed by the king complemented her unsparingly. And the one most frustrated by this was her sister, Princess Ashla. As they walked past each other in the hallway, Ashla began to pick on Blanche.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;My, my, isn&rsquo;t this my sister dear. Greetings to you. Have you been studying hard today as well? Although that&rsquo;s important, you&rsquo;ll be disliked if you don&rsquo;t go kiss Duke Grunce&rsquo;s</span><sup class="c3 c30"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;son Lord Guinias&rsquo;s ass properly, you know?&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The family of Duke Grunce, the famous royal family known since ancient times as the maintainer of Namrium. A noble family, powerful even within the Eastern Empire. Grunce&rsquo;s domain alone held a population of three hundred thousand. The heir to such nobility from the Empire had been staying around Silberia since a year ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Guinias Nam Grunce.</span><sup class="c3 c30"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Age twenty-two, a young man talented in many fields. Guinias had an elder brother who&rsquo;d been appointed as the next duke. Because of that, it was rumored that Guinias had laid his sights on the throne of Silberia. It was an open secret among the Silberian public, most of who supported such an attempt. There were many reasons for it, the most pertinent one being to maintain friendly relations with the Empire. If the big shot royalty became the king of Silberia, they expected less pressure to be exerted on this province state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">There was also another reason. Guinias had imported a variety of wares into Silberia by leveraging his connections through Grunce, successfully winning the favour of the kingdom&rsquo;s royalty with those extremely attractive goods. Those imports were also highly profitable within the kingdom and improved the citizens&rsquo; well-being. And for that reason, support for Guinias within the kingdom rose sky-high without any sign of slowing down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">That was how Guinias secured his remarkable popularity in Silberia. He was still young and handsome, and already brought great wealth to the nation, so becoming son-in-law of the queen wasn&rsquo;t far off&mdash;that was the opinion of many within the nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">And the one Guinias had laid his eyes on was Princess Blanche, who had been guarding a secret. King Silberia was mindful of the marriage&rsquo;s significance, &ldquo;If I was to help Blanche become the next queen, I would agree to the marriage.&rdquo; Guinias swiftly promised his commitment. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">That meant making Blanche the next queen. Ashla couldn&rsquo;t stand the idea of Blanche getting crowded, she couldn&rsquo;t tolerate the thought of their roles getting reversed. Besides, her mother Emilia had also been outraged by this. She exploited many tactics and invested a great deal of time and effort throughout the years to help her own daughter become the next queen, yet it had all been ruined by the appearance of Guinias. Even the nobles among Emilia&rsquo;s circle had begun to flatter Guinias. If that were to continue, they would be handing the queen&rsquo;s throne to Blanche.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">But there was still a way, as long as she could change Guinias&rsquo;s heart. Emilia instilled this into Ashla, hoping she would win Lord Guinias&rsquo;s heart instead. But even if she hadn&rsquo;t told her so, Ashla shared the same intent. She had gone to great lengths to jeopardize her sister&rsquo;s relationship with Guinias in order to snatch her fianc&eacute;. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">This act was also part of her scheme, but Blanche didn&rsquo;t really mind. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oh, Ash. Good health to you. I&rsquo;m glad you are concerned for me. But, it&rsquo;s really nothing. I shall be accompanying Guinias-sama to walk the city later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&hellip;Is that so. You make me jealous. Very well, I hope you have a pleasant time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hmm. It&rsquo;s work after all, one should not indulge their desire for pleasure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Like that, she was able to dismantle Ashla&rsquo;s effort to provoke her. Blanche was hardly a young child anymore. She&rsquo;d been hard at work behind everyone&rsquo;s back to gain knowledge and power. Nowadays, even those servants couldn&rsquo;t openly harass her, instead they had to find other subtler ways to do so. Likewise for Ashla, who could merely attempt to provoke her through sarcasm. And for that reason her hatred for Blanche festered day by day. Yet Blanche seemed unfazed even knowing so. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">If anything, Blanche seemed to no longer be alone. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the way to go. Treat everyone around you as an enemy. However, there&rsquo;s no need to defeat them all. You need only to differentiate those who can and cannot be manipulated. Hold on to their secrets to force them into serving you. Your sister is but a pawn used by that mother named Emilia. Neither is she useful nor a threat to your presence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I understand, big sis.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">She now had a reliable friend named Blanc. That was why Blanche become strong. Her knowledge and magic were all taught by Blanc. Blanche accepted and humbly learnt her teachings and had grown dramatically in the past three years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Huh! Then be cautious when you do have some fun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I will, you do that too, Ash.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The two princesses appeared to coexist in harmony, yet the mutual hostility within their hearts burned like wildfire; thankfully any confrontations dissolved before escalating. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Just like that, Blanche developed day by day, gaining more and more supporters. She&rsquo;d also been doing quite well with Guinias, at some point they came to represent the ideal couple. The number of people backing Guinias steadily increased with it. The royals who were still observing the situation also started to step forward in recognizing Blanche as the next queen in line. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">During this period, Emilia&rsquo;s intervention attempts became more radical. She scantly cared about decency anymore and resorted to bloodthirsty violence, ordering the assassination of Blanche.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">However, every attempt amounted to failure. That was to be expected; Blanc within Blanche wouldn&rsquo;t deign to let mere hitmen harm Blanche.<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It was smooth sailing. All signs pointed towards her becoming the new queen in due time. The citizenry deemed the increasingly beautiful Blanche as worthy of being their queen. Blanche also gathered the confidence to show a delightful smile to people other than Blanc. That was her sign for having bonded with others, something that Blanc expected from her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">But, there were still parts which she was dissatisfied with. That would be Blanche&rsquo;s relationship with Guinias. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">&hellip;this is a real headache. &ldquo;Romance&rdquo; is an emotion that begets naught but uncertainty, nothing good whatsoever comes of it. If Blanche&rsquo;s emotions are to be significantly affected, then I&rsquo;ll have to confront whatever should follow. God damn hum&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">But, if Blanche could be happy, Blanc didn&rsquo;t really mind. Even if her partner was a stupid human, she would send them her blessing truthfully. Nothing less could be expected of Blanche&rsquo;s friend.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanc had a very bad feeling about Guinias.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Setting aside incarnation and rebirth into this world, Blanc was currently in an incomplete state. Likewise, her subordinates were only of spiritual existence and had limited impact on the physical world. Even if that was the case, Blanc would try her best to strategize accordingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanc would later come to find her apprehension manifesting in reality.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s the end of the report.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">After receiving the reports from her subordinate, Blanc felt a disquieting sense of dread about the situation. She had dispatched scores of demons to collect information in Silberia&rsquo;s capital, surrounding towns, as well as within Grunce&rsquo;s territory. These, however, revealed some significant issues. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">Even though I&rsquo;ve always been on high alert with that man, I couldn&rsquo;t have expected his comprehensive defense against demons. In other words, he has come to this kingdom fully aware of our existence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The information collection returned no results ever since Blanche began hanging out with Guinias. Moreover, no useful information at all was collected since, that&rsquo;s why Blanc had begun to suspect him. Precisely because not a scrap of useful intelligence was collected, it made things far too suspicious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">And so she increased the scope of the search while dispatching her top lieutenants. As a result, she began to uncover Guinias&rsquo;s real intentions. <br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;Guinias knows the connection between Silberia and Blanc. And from that, it is conceivable that he decided to intervene after finding out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;Silver white hair and red pupils. One who possesses both would be the key to the coming of the ancient demon.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It was no trivial thing to investigate. But if the big-shot royalty in the Empire had a hand in this, their way of extracting the truth made such conclusions plausible. In that case, his relationship with Blanche was nothing but a farce as well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case&hellip; Unforgivable, absolutely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanc&rsquo;s face contorted as she gazed at the sky covered in dark clouds. Rather than worrying about the road to her second coming, a project she had planned for eons, being cut off&mdash;right now she was simply worried about a friend&rsquo;s happiness being lost.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">A melancholic sigh came out of Blanc&rsquo;s beautiful, thin lips.<br></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Guinias enjoyed quite the popularity in the capital of Silberia. There are several reasons to explain why, but the most prevalent one was monetary and pragmatic. To establish a new industry, he had considered exploring the mines containing magicule ores. In fact, the kingdom of Silberia possessed a high concentration of magicule, leading to the ores collected from the mine being of high quality. And Duke Grunce&rsquo;s territory bought them at a high price. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Before his arrival, Silberia was a nation sustained through primary industry such as agriculture, farming and fishing. Citizens were mostly care-free people that led a self-sustained, simple lifestyle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">But now, the seeds of profiteering industries were planted. Alongside those, a number of entertainment industries began to take root. One of the most popular attractions was gambling at horse races. Given the insidious nature of gambling, those who turned rich overnight became obsessed with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The kind and modest citizens were gradually corrupted, bit by bit. Financial troubles came to grasp the less fortunate, where Guinias astutely lent them his money with a smile. This generosity propelled his support to unseen heights. Other than having a populist foundation, Guinias had executed his preparations in every field. He steadily expanded his influence by welcoming the influx of royalty that attempted to befriend him. He threw out his money by the bucketload in the name Grunce, the largest noble family in the Empire, and then subsequently recycled the money back into his own pocket. His actions all reflected his immense talents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Everything went according to the master plan. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;This is fairly boring to be honest,&rdquo; Guinias sneered coldly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fun now that everything is running perfectly according to my plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hahaha, Guinias-sama. Please don&rsquo;t say so. This type of remote backwater will go nuts over some pitiful fun. It really can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The one complimenting Guinias was one of his aides from the home country. To the public he was nothing more than a minister-type butler who helped Guinias with random chores, given his status. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Huh! Nevertheless, I still couldn&rsquo;t get my way with the key figure, Blanche. Can&rsquo;t that woman just accept me already? She always responds to me with some nonsense about keeping her chastity before marriage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Well, forget not that she is the princess of a nation. So it&rsquo;s understandable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Everything has been according to plan, except for this woman. She irritates me to no end,&rdquo; Guinias complained. This was his nature, beneath his fa&ccedil;ade as a noble heir. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Okay, okay Guinias-sama. You needn&rsquo;t keep that unpleasant look. You won&rsquo;t have to endure for long.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The one responding to him, a measly and cruel looking man, was another trusted subordinate of Guinias, who was in charge of his finances. He had been promised the role of the royal merchant in the land of Duke Grunce upon Guinias&rsquo;s becoming a duke. To this end, he only needed to serve Guinias by investing and spreading money to Guinias&rsquo;s desires.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ho? Have the preparations been finished?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes. We&rsquo;ve negotiated with the military and got permission to secretly mobilize the Armored Corps. I spent a lot of money buying the gifts for Calgurio</span><sup class="c3 c30"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">, but we should be able to assemble sufficient manpower within the estimated time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hahaha, that&rsquo;s impressive. At last our plan has reached its final stage. My days as a duke are imminent, I await the time with pleasure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Guinias fantasized about the near future, wearing a despicable grin on his face.<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Their plan was straightforward. Guinias was to pretend to marry into the royal family by being engaged with Blanche, who had the claim to the throne. But in reality, Guinias was not satisfied with merely being the king of Silberia&mdash;his dream was to become the duke of Grunce. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">His brother had become an eyesore as of late, but that had already been dealt with. If he was to rebel, Guinias already considered disposing of him. But his brother was aware of his younger brother&rsquo;s nature; knowing their difference in ability, he had already assumed a position within Guinias&rsquo;s military. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Guinias&rsquo;s future as a duke was set in stone. So one might ask why he would visit the kingdom of Silberia in the first place&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;So, Guinias-sama, would Blanche be willing to leave with us as planned?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Huh. We haven&rsquo;t slept, but that woman has already fallen for me. I don&rsquo;t think she will refuse, but just in case, I&rsquo;ve tipped the military.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I see. If possible, we should avoid using violence. For some reason, I sense the forthcoming of an unnatural power if we are to invade this land with force.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Our party agrees to that as well, let&rsquo;s try to avoid war. Guinias-dono, it would trouble me greatly should this land fall to warfare. Facing such a development, I would need to reevaluate my relationship with you. To me, it would truly be a shame to not be able to maintain our partnership, but I wish to be on good terms with my granddaughter, who is soon to be crowned. If Duke Grunce&rsquo;s household is to forge an alliance with us, us members of the kingdom of Silberia could live long and prosper as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The one pandering was Emilia&rsquo;s father, Marquis Barnes</span><sup class="c3 c30"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">. He had collected intelligence himself, anticipating his violent daughter lunging towards more violent actions. And through his instinct as a nobleman, he discerned that Guinias&rsquo;s end-goal was never the throne of this kingdom. Barnes then took a gamble in order to make his granddaughter the queen, and approached Guinias, inquiring his true intent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">In the end, Barnes was accepted by Guinias and thus expressed his true thoughts. Guinias wanted to bring Blanche to his home country, and Barnes saw Blanche as a burden, best to be evicted from Silberia. Bound by a mutual goal, they decided to form an alliance. And it was for that reason that Barnes wholeheartedly wished to avoid any conflict with the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Then, Marquis Barnes, would you be able to keep this country&rsquo;s royalty under control?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Of course. Even if the king or Princess Blanche herself object, most of the nobles are on Guinias-sama&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; Barnes carefully responded to the young and not-yet-Duke Guinias. This was, indeed, a reflection of the overwhelming difference in power between big and small nations. Barnes had to force a smile for the sake of his granddaughter, as well as his own authority, even if it repulsed him. In spite Guinias already having seen through Barnes&rsquo;s act, he kept on smiling as if unaware.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Very well, then when shall we execute the plan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">To Guinias, who wished to return home as soon as possible, the sooner, the better. However, he had endured for so long and cautiously planned his every step, so it would have been unwise to rush and mess up in the end. To ensure the success of the plan, the date of execution was extremely crucial.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It would only take a few days to surround the area completely with the formation of the army.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;The next festival of sacrifice at the palace, which happens to be princess Blanche&rsquo;s sixteenth birthday. In our country, one officially enters adulthood upon that age, it would be an appropriate time to make a proposal. Besides, most of the royalty would gather on that day, wouldn&rsquo;t that precisely be the best timing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Huhuhu, as expected of Marquis Barnes. When did you find out that I planned on that day from the start?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hahaha, it&rsquo;s just a coincidence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Very well, we&rsquo;ll settle for a coincidence. Then our plan shall be set in motion on the next day of sacrifice. Any disagreement?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">With the approval of the other three men, the day of battle had been settled. Then once Barnes was the first to leave, only men of the Empire remained in the room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Speaking of whom, what an idiotic man. But he&rsquo;s clever you know, even as a noble he&rsquo;s good at his stuff.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;As you&rsquo;ve said, he just let go of Princess Blanche, their national treasure. Completely unaware that whoever were next to inherit the throne would be meaningless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;The bloody red pupil is a sign of the curse. That silver white hair surely makes people think of that horrifying and damning &lsquo;Primordial&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m impressed that despite every characteristic matching, the idiot nobles of this country are oblivious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;The Empire has been pushing behind the scenes to make them realize as well. To prevent that demon from coming to this world,&rdquo; Guinias said with a calm and focused expression.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The demon within this land truly was an eyesore to the Empire. The demons invading human lands could generally be assigned to three categories: Demons who can be negotiated with, demons who won&rsquo;t listen to reason, and demons who do whatever they wish.</span><sup class="c3 c30"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;The demons from Silberia were known for their willingness to negotiate with others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Yet the White Queen was really something else. There was no way one could sit and negotiate with her on equal terms. However, the one who broke that common sense was the first ancient monarch of Silberia. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It traces back to around 3000 years ago, and it&rsquo;s no simple matter to pass on the correct historical narrative. But this irresponsibility on their part for not caring about their own national emergency is astounding.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Early rulers of Silberia formed a covenant with the master of many demons, Primordial Blanc. Its content being to facilitate the coming of Blanc to this realm, and in return, she would be the guardian of the kingdom of Silberia. Testament to the pact were the &lsquo;Crimson Eyes&rsquo; that could see through anything, a power only possessed by the king&rsquo;s lineage. With the purpose of inheriting a cursed bloodline and amassing magicule throughout generations. And then, when the heir with the ideal flesh for the Primordial appears, it shall possess it and come forth to this world once more.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The Empire exhausted its means of espionage to explore the content of this secret pact. They had long been preparing in order to be ahead of the demons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;So, Guinias-sama. What would you do with princess Blanche? Are you really going to marry her?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid. Even if I decide to play around with her for a couple of years, I would get in serious trouble if she got pregnant. Before that happens, she will just have to die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s reassuring to hear. If it were me, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to have that type of woman with demonic character as my master.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hahaha, it&rsquo;s a shame really. But we have to destroy the bloodline in its entirety.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Of course I understand that. As soon as we end the king&rsquo;s lineage, even the Primordial will be powerless. And unlike that Crimson Demon Lord, the White Queen is a picky one. We were much assisted thanks to that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Regardless, we should be able to cut off the royal bloodline </span><span class="c3">completely.</span><span class="c4 c3">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Then, about Princess Ashla&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t ask that, it&rsquo;s for your own good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Hahaha, sorry for the intrusion. But I haven&#39;t asked anything yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have spoken of it in the first place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Then, they continued their plotting. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Without noticing that a small bug had secretly concealed itself on the corner of the window&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">The sixteenth Birthday of Blanche. That day would mark the beginning of the &ldquo;Lakeshore Dyed Scarlet Incident&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanche was filled with regret. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">She had already heard of Blanc&rsquo;s advice, yet she smiled and said it was fine, failing to assess her circumstance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You will go with me, right, Blanche?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;But, Guinias-sama, I must follow my father&rsquo;s will. Just a little bit more would do, it is my duty to improve this country. Haven&rsquo;t you also sworn to support me behind my back?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I hope you reconsider, Blanche. I too approve of your devotion to this kingdom. When you arrive at my country, we will continue to assist you in contributing to the kingdom of Silberia in terms of economic and cultural exchange. There will be countless things we can do. I&rsquo;ll also respect your decisions. Now what do you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">For the past day, Blanche&rsquo;s head had been filled with the idea that Guinias would support her becoming queen one day. Guinias had always gone to tell those nobles supporting her that the throne was exclusively for Blanche. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">In the ancient past, Blanc extended a helping hand to the people suffering from poverty in the form of a pact. In order to fulfill the vow with Blanc, this country needed to bear a real queen. At last, this country had gained what it needed&mdash;she believed this would also have been what everyone hoped for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanche was puzzled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Guinias&rsquo;s proposal was to bring her to the Empire, and that was something unacceptable to her. Yet Guinias hadn&rsquo;t mentioned it until then. The tumultuous situation could&rsquo;ve even plunged Blanc into chaos. Moreover, all nobles present at the gathering approved of Guinias&rsquo;s proposal. This was a particularly deep betrayal towards Blanche. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c23 c14">How can this be&hellip; I thought I was the one everyone needed?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The sharp disruption</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;dropped a layer of despair upon Blanche&rsquo;s heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No! I will not allow you to take Blanche abroad!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Suddenly, Blanche&rsquo;s father&mdash;the king&mdash;shouted. The king, who worked his heart and soul for the country all his life, who was always calm and quiet, now stared at Guinias with burning rage in his eyes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You bastard, have you been plotting to take Blanche abroad from the start? Your actions have tarnished the Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;My, whatever are you talking about? This matter is nothing but beneficial for both kingdoms.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Absurdity! Th-this country, since ancient times has been&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that your majesty would still believe those stale superstitions, for if that&rsquo;s true, you&rsquo;ll be a laughing stock before your guests,&rdquo; Guinias retorted with a scornful tone, as if trying to taunt and mock the king. The nobles joined in with laughter; they ostensibly held loyalty to the king, but had long committed treachery. Guinias had prepared everything for it as well, just for this day. The celebration of Blanche&rsquo;s sixteenth birthday was no more. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Y-you whoreson&hellip;sabotaged my country&rsquo;s politics&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Your majesty, you are too nice of a person. Were you so naive as to believe that those around you would never betray you, and that the people of this country were loyal is if bonded by blood? I&rsquo;m sorry to inform you that these were all mere fantasies. We humans will resort to anything for the sake of our own interests. If we get to keep our life, money and a bright future safe and sound in our pocket, we wouldn&rsquo;t even flinch to betray our nation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to fool us! I&rsquo;ve distinguished you as a traitor. But the people of my country are earnest in wishing for Blanche to become their queen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Aiya, I&rsquo;m rather skeptical about that. Your majesty, I suggest you understand your circumstance better. I would be uneasy about the future if my father in law kept acting this way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;WHAT!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you three days&rsquo; time. Before the deadline, please hand over Princess Blanche.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Wait! Did you honestly think I would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Your majesty, you should yield to Guinias-dono&rsquo;s proposal. Should we let Princess Blanche marry Guinias-dono, our connections with the Empire would certainly become closer. If you truly want someone to be the queen, my granddaughter is still around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, father. If you choose me, I&rsquo;ll definitely be a better queen than my sister.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Marquis Barnes interrupted, followed by Princess Ashla, their voices drowning out the king. These were supposed to be vile acts punishable to the highest degree without forgiveness. Yet, none of the nobles intervened, not even the minority who still held a sense of conscience, as they were forced into silence under the intense stares of the nobles supporting the Barnes family. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The king came to terms with his plight, his face distorting with regret. Facing the king at such dismay, Guinias calmly stated with a victorious tone: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;About what we just discussed, about what the people truly want&mdash;you should know the answer with tomorrow&rsquo;s morning paper. You might as well read it before you answer anything. Please do contemplate what the right decision for this nation truly is. I shall await your response.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Guinias had done his part. He then left the scorned king with those words. He departed from the celebration hall, and many nobles did as well, as if following him. The ones who remained in the venue were the king, Blanche and a handful of nobles. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;How can this&hellip; Are those people ignorant of our situation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;If-if this is to continue, our kingdom will fall into ruin&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The King and the royals sighed, to an onlooker they resembled lost souls&mdash;&mdash;<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The morning of the next day. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Hidden away in the most secure chamber within the king&rsquo;s castle, those who remained at the celebration hall gathered. Before them lay the country&#39;s morning newspaper, its content distressing everyone present. The cover page was filled with celebratory headlines.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&mdash;&mdash;The great nobleman Guinias has come to marry Princess Blanche. It is equivalent to an engagement, surely she will become his wife and forge a proper marriage&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The newspaper declared it as such.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over. My holy goddess, what an unforgivable betrayal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the king collapsed on his chair with a whimper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Blanche. If only I had told you&mdash;forgive me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No-no, there&rsquo;s no such thing! Father has done nothing wrong. It is I who&rsquo;s been too immature.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;What are you talking about. You may be sixteen now, but you are still a child. You are still so young, yet such hardship&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s absurd! It is I who fell for Guinias-sama&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Enough&hellip;that&rsquo;s enough. We should consider the near future instead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Everyone present began to express their views on that line of thought. The prime minister spoke first: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;The people are also convinced about the content of the paper. There&rsquo;s no doubt to them that princess-sama is getting married. They all feel that the country has developed to become affluent, and their blind confidence has numbed their ability to </span><span class="c3">doubt.</span><span class="c4 c3">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The court mage commander said: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Your majesty, from last night&rsquo;s investigation, our country has been surrounded by the Imperial military. They&rsquo;ve already drawn our people to their side, they could fabricate reasons to start a war at this point. Rightful justification in the public eye&hellip;would probably lie with the Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The Army Chief followed up: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Allow me to be blunt here, we won&rsquo;t stand a chance with the current strength of our army. Moreover, there may be soldiers in favour of the Empire within our ranks, who could announce that we&rsquo;ve been surrounded, even before battle breaks out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The situation was desperate. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">But they couldn&rsquo;t meekly obey the Empire like a dog. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;We will not bow to the Empire. Should we do such a thing, we would be betraying our ancient pact. There will be travesties far, far more tragic and horrifying than destruction at the hands of the Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Indeed, my king! Our god is a terrifying existence. If we were to disavow our promise, we would warrant punishment worse than death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that the number of nobles who have forgotten about this has increased to such magnitude. How pathetic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;We shall fight, even if to no avail. Perhaps God will show mercy in light of our sincerity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The kingdom of Silberia&mdash;a kingdom bonded by an ancient pact. If they were to disavow the deal with God&mdash;with the demon&mdash;what awaited them ahead would be torment far more terrifying than the demise of their flesh. It was because they knew this all too well, that they could not succumb to the Empire&rsquo;s demands. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Even if the country was destroyed&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;How about w-we summon our god&hellip;our god. Then, we shall unite and face our demise,&rdquo; the court mage commander said solemnly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Everyone nodded. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">There may still be time before the final verdict&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanche couldn&rsquo;t hear what her father and the rest were saying, only despair and sadness burst into her heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;This is all my fault&hellip; it&rsquo;s all because I didn&rsquo;t listen to Blanc&rsquo;s advice&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No, Blanche. It is because my strength has yet to be fully developed. So you shouldn&rsquo;t feel bad about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not true! Maybe it&rsquo;s because&hellip;because I wished to be your friend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Calm down Blanche&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Blanc. I&rsquo;m not needed by anyone after all. Whether it be Guinias-sama or the people of this country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I-I need you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Thank you. Truly, thank you for everything you&rsquo;ve done, Blanc&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Blanche, what are you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">This may have been the first time Blanc had panicked since her birth. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It is because of my promise to you, that Blanc&rsquo;s power has been limited, right? I truly thank you for keeping your end of the bargain with this country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Stop it, Blanche! This is just a pact. I don&rsquo;t care anymore. To me, what&rsquo;s important is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Thank you, and I apologize. I&rsquo;m not as strong as you. But I&rsquo;m still happy about one point. You are willing to use my body, for that I am satisfied. So Blanc, live your life freely from now on&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Then, Blanche&rsquo;s &ldquo;soul&rdquo; executed the pact. Based on which, Blanche would transfer her body to Blanc. Blanche&rsquo;s shining, colourful soul, fell into Blanc&rsquo;s hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ah&hellip;ah&hellip; Blanche, so gentle and kind&hellip;my Blanche. I love you, I love you the most. My first ever friend. I couldn&rsquo;t protect that gentle and kind you, oh how powerless I am&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Primordial White&mdash;Queen of Demons, symbol of power&mdash;now trembled and lamented her powerlessness. Perhaps this was a sight that no one who knew her would ever believe. There was no audience, yet this was the reality. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanc obtained Blanche&rsquo;s flesh without the king&rsquo;s witness.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">The court mage commander responded first among the group discussing the plans for the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;God, I&rsquo;ve heard the voice of god&mdash;&mdash;!?&rdquo; he shouted and extended both of his hands to Blanche, sitting quietly alone. Then he poured all of his magic into a magical circle on the ground, initiating the ritual to summon the demon. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;W-what are you doin&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">What followed was faster than the sentence the king couldn&rsquo;t finish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Greetings Gentlemen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanche stood up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">No. This was no longer Blanche.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">This was Blanc in the body of Blanche. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Everyone present knew exactly what had occurred and fell to their knees on the spot. Among them, only the king remained standing and asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;G-God! Why&hellip;now? Your pact with Blanche should still&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Unfortunately this pact has just been invoked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No, this can&rsquo;t be possible! My daughter, Blanche confided in me that you would protect her&mdash;&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You are&hellip;rather noisy, please quiet down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanc&rsquo;s words shut the king up. But he couldn&rsquo;t hide his anger thinking that Blanc broke the pact. However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The king&rsquo;s anger dispersed in the face of an immense, bottomless fury. The source of which, needless to say&mdash;belonged to Blanc.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It is because you stupid humans took away my pleasure. Don&rsquo;t you all agree this is a grave crime to be punished for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The king froze out of fear. For only he sensed Blanc&rsquo;s fury. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I-If God wishes so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Even though that answer was just one line, it exhausted him completely. Then, the debilitated king crumbled back into his chair. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Good boy. Since you&rsquo;ve kept true to your pact with me, I shall grant you all a painless death, however&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">What of those who broke the covenant?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">No one dared to ask about their consequences. Then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Everyone present was blessed. They now walked the path under their god&rsquo;s command, their hearts in bliss, to be relieved from ever learning the tragedy that was about to take place. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Very well, let us feast.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">As Blanc commanded, the demons quickly possessed all of the bodies at the scene. The tragedy now unveils&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanc, clouded by fury, cast out the forbidden magic. A spell to grant peaceful death to those who kept true to the pact and bestow endless torment to the traitors. It caused one to bleed to death from the inside out, the demise of this nation being seared into their eyes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The effect of that curse covered her entire domain, no living being could escape the curse. But this was hardly enough to abate Blanc&rsquo;s wrath. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Bring those cretins before me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">In that moment, not a single suggestion from her subordinates could&rsquo;ve gotten through to her, even her ancient trusted aides&mdash;Demon Dukes&mdash;would&rsquo;ve been sent to the guillotine, should they have caught her ire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;Understood!&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Following the word, the demons scattered, returning after a few short minutes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Who do you think I am! Show yourself now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The first, arrogant, non-sense spitting fool had been brought before her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Oh, Marquis Barnes, so you are the first.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;A-are you Blanche?! Why are you sitting on that chair!? That belongs to his majesty alone, that is the majestic throne!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You are really noisy, you know? That&rsquo;s some annoying barking coming from a petit nobody.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;W-what did you say? How dare you say that to me, you-you are just a little girl&mdash;&mdash;ah&hellip;!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Barnes, clearly bluffing, looked into Blanc&rsquo;s eyes and felt a sensation of ice cold water being poured onto his heart. The biting frost climbed up his back, with a broken spirit he was reduced to observing his surroundings. He stood where all the losers were supposed to be, yet not a single soul remained. The figures of losers who could only lament their defeat through the scheme of Guinias. The only person in front of him was Blanc.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Blanche&hellip;is no more. Try to use your remaining few brain cells to try to understand me now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Only hearing that did Barnes begin to notice how strange Blanc looked. Blanche had always been a pretty girl, but the one in front of him couldn&rsquo;t simply be described as beautiful. Her hair, whiter than snow, decorated the crown whilst she spitefully gazed down at Barnes with her crimson eyes. The gaps between her dark dress vaguely flashed her smooth white skin. Its seductive gleam could instill lust, yet before all else, it showed them fear. It was the type of beauty beyond human&rsquo;s comprehension.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Barnes became speechless having guessed her true identity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;C-Could it be&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Settle down, now. Soon I&rsquo;ll invite your family and friends here too, let us have a celebration.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Marquis Barnes had no right to refuse. Before he could say a thing, he was shackled in front of the throne. Then, another few minutes passed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Slow down this instant! Who do you think I am!!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">A woman shrieked words akin to Barnes&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;What are you doing! Are you knowingly offending the next queen!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">That foolish young girl radiated an arrogant attitude without even knowing what she had gotten herself into. She was brought before Blanc.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I guess it runs in the genes. Perhaps you all can reflect a bit if this girl sheds a little blood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">She may have been the heir to the king&rsquo;s blood, yet she held no significance to Blanc then. Ostensibly forgetting about that, she glanced over the two who had been brought in front of her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Blanche&hellip; What are you doing here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Sister, please understand you position. Wife of the imperial nobleman is just an empty title. Do you understand that you are a mere lamb waiting to be slaughtered without anyone to back you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">People unable to comprehend their circumstances tried to argue against Blanc. But that folly was devoured by a fiery blaze once Blanc&rsquo;s eyes focused on her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I-I fee-feel horrible! Ca-can&rsquo;t brea&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;KYAA&mdash;&mdash;! I-it burns! MY FACE, MY SKIN IS BURNING&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;What an unpleasant sight. I will not let you off the hook that easily for bullying my friend all these years.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Hearing that cold and emotionless voice, it struck Emilia and Ashla that he one before them was not Blanche. By that time it was already far too late. But, even if they had understood any earlier, Blanc would not have forgiven them anyway. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;You two should wait here for our final guest to show up,</span><span class="c3">&rdquo; Blanc</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;said without even dignifying the wretched </span><span class="c3">women</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;with a glance. The last one&mdash;the man with the most sins. Only the hatred towards him burned quietly deep-within Blanc&rsquo;s eyes. <br></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Guinias was satisfied with how everything went according to his wishes and merrily drank the day away. Thanks to teleportation magic, his body was not exhausted despite having traveled to such a remote nation. Or rather, he was quite energetic, having fully immersed in the joy of last night&rsquo;s victory. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;This was a triumph. Now all that&rsquo;s left is to get Princess Blanche out here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;If we are rejected, we&rsquo;ll just have to force her away with the military.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hmm, the people are on our side as well. But you&rsquo;ve got to make it clear to the military to avoid damaging the </span><span class="c3">surroundings.</span><span class="c4 c3">&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Of course. This land will soon be in Guinias-sama&rsquo;s pocket. So be cautious not to harm any civilians.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you handle that,&rdquo; Guinias laughed in high spirits. But his mirthful moment was suddenly interrupted by some intruders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been summoned by our queen, please come forth with us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Resistance is futile, we&rsquo;ve already eliminated anyone in our path.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The two who showed up were the embodiments of inhuman strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;What the hell are the guards doing!?&rdquo; Guinias shouted, despite which, not a single one came to his room. The smaller of the two interlopers mockingly smirked at the panicked Guinias and said: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say, we&rsquo;ve taken care of the ones that looked like they&rsquo;d get in our way?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The innocent voice delivered a vicious line. This made Guinias&rsquo;s aides realize those two were no ordinary beings. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Then, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, farewell then, bye-bye!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The two only took Guinias away as they loyally carried out their master&rsquo;s order. The people remaining began to panic and shout.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Those are demons. DEMONS have come to stop us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Go inform the military! Guinias-sama has been kidnapped!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Th-that is probably&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The message was swiftly relayed to the military camp. Guinias-sama was kidnapped despite a highly secured premise. The two criminals, their true identities likely being&mdash;Greater Demon Generals. Those unprecedented reports plunged the military base into pandemonium. What immediately followed&mdash;the operation was urgently revised to demon hunting. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">On the other side, Guinias </span><span class="c3">unwillingly</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;had the pleasure to experience demonic air travel. At first Guinias was still resisting, the young nobleman acquired combat skill equivalent to B rank adventurers and was acclaimed for his excellence in both brass and brain. In fact, having reached rank B, one could at least become a lieutenant officer within the army&mdash;quite the talent in others&rsquo; eyes. Because of that, Guinias had been rather naive in thinking he would be able to beat a demon or two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">His preconceptions were easily crushed. These two demons were able to rush in and kidnap Guinias from the military base filled with sharp soldiers and a strictly secured perimeter. Their incredible strength spoke for itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;You bastards, what are you going to do to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Look below.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Guinias looked down and witnessed scenes straight from hell. Their faces torn, twisted with agony, blood flowing out of their body without end. They writhed in pain&mdash;people, people everywhere. The once tidy streets were tainted with blood, while fresh blood kept gushing into the lake. It was dyeing the lake scarlet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;WHAT!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Guinias was speechless at the sight, but he soon regained clarity and howled: &ldquo;You damn demons! You bastards, you should never have existed in this world! The people living on this land have signed a contract with your master. But you&hellip; How dare you just sacrifice them like this!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Hearing it, the small demon shook its head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the case. It&rsquo;s all because of your actions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Caused by my actions?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yeah. You. You taught them to be like this. It was </span><span class="c3 c14">you</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;who seduced and betrayed our master&rsquo;s ally Blanche-sama, and attempted to exile her from the country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want traitors, nor do we want collaborators who failed to prevent the betrayal. They both carry equal sin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Wait a moment! What about children? Shouldn&rsquo;t there also be innocent infants? Are you just gonna kill them all!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;What gives you the illusion of righteousness?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I just say that your sins are collective? But our master has shown mercy this time. She even granted those free of sin a painless death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That was really surprising. If she was anything like before, exemptions would&rsquo;ve been unthinkable. I suppose it&rsquo;s all by virtue of Blanche-sama. That Blanche-sama also died because of you. So all of these tragedies are of your doing, look below and have its sights burned into your heart.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Guinias felt confused being told so. At heart, he was not a man of pure evil. He&rsquo;d contracted all the self-serving habits of a noble, and it was his sincere conviction that a noble was nothing without their people. First improve citizens&rsquo; standard of living, entrap their support through entertainment, then milk them through taxation and their labor. Because those were his previously held beliefs, his heart began to shake upon seeing so many people being slaughtered below him</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">I-I&rsquo;ve done nothing wrong. I&rsquo;m not wrong!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">He told himself that, trying to steady his mind. But then, he could no longer keep his composure after hearing the next line coming out of the demon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tragic indeed that the residents are involved as well. But rest assured that you are the one who caused all of this, you ain&rsquo;t gonna be let off the hook with just this amount of suffering. So don&rsquo;t lose your nerve just yet, brace yourself now for what&rsquo;s next to come.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Guinias came to terms with his reality&mdash;that horrifying reality crawled in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;No-no. Someone save me, please let me go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Sorry, but we can&rsquo;t help you with that. We&rsquo;ll get killed for it,</span><span class="c3">&rdquo; answered</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;the small, frowning demon, to which the other agreed. Then, Guinias was dragged in front of the queen. His ego shattered along with his inner self. Guinias was a shell of his former self.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ara ara, what happened to prince charming? Why are you crying so much? Have you pissed yourself too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Someone save me, I&rsquo;m begging you, please spare me,&rdquo; Guinias wailed while sobbing like a bitch. Hearing this, Blanc&rsquo;s laughter echoed with joy. Alas, the fire of hatred in her eyes only grew in ferocity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Idiot, why would I ever spare you now? But, you </span><span class="c3 c14">are</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;pretty lucky.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Ayy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Guinias regained some hope hearing Blanc&rsquo;s words and raised his head. What met him was a sinister smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;At least you are not the only one getting punished. You won&rsquo;t feel lonely that way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In front of </span><span class="c3">Blanc</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;lay Guinias&rsquo;s companions&rsquo; figures, their faces filled with fear and agony, and their bodies ugly, distorted and rotten. They&rsquo;d been stripped of all clothing, their dignity as high nobility was a thing of the past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;N-no! Forgive me, please forgive me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do. Farewell then, fool. Enjoy the curse that grants you eternal suffering without death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Guinias heard that annoying yet beautiful voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;NOOOOOOO&mdash;&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Guinias left the world with a loud scream before his consciousness was consumed by terror and agony&mdash;what followed was a hellish inferno beyond words.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Afterwards, the Imperial army that rushed into Silberia were terrified by the mere sight of the calamity. Fierce battles against the demons broke out. The elites who triumphed against the demons were able to head to the capital. There, they confronted Blanc.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">By that time they arrived, Blanc had completed her revenge and was filled with desolation. She had no motivation of fighting whatsoever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c14">I feel so empty. Blanche is not around, nor her country as my playground. I suppose I don&rsquo;t have any further reason to stick around these lands&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanc sparred with the Imperial knights while thinking that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get careless! From the situation, our enemy is the &lsquo;White&rsquo; primordial. But do not be afraid! Us Trinity</span><sup class="c3 c30"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;will not be defeated, even by Primordial Blanc.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">She had little interest in fighting the menacing knights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c23 c14">What a mess. I could easily win but don&rsquo;t want to risk hurting Blanche&rsquo;s body. I should just retreat to let the children of this land have a good sleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Blanc ceased fighting early on. It was the saving grace for the knights that had confronted her. Their identity was the most elite military force within the Empire, the emperor&rsquo;s Imperial Knight Corps. However, the knights were no match for the White Queen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">If Blanc had fought seriously, the Imperial army would likely have been wiped out. They were convinced of their victory, not realizing their luck in avoiding their complete demise. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Then, Blanc&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">She left her host body and cut ties with the physical world as her parting gift for Blanche. In order for no one to ever touch her flesh and let it rest in immortal beauty, Blanc casted a special seal to bury Blanche beneath this land. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Good night, Blanche. I&rsquo;ll have the souls of those who kept their promise sent to you as well, so that you will not feel lonely on the other side, and may you rest in peace there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Many souls with shining sparks gathered around Blanche&rsquo;s soul. Then, Blanc carefully released them all. Even though demons enjoy souls the most&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">&ldquo;Farewell. When would I&hellip;meet you again&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Perhaps Blanc didn&rsquo;t want to consume Blanche&rsquo;s soul and for that she pretended to be destroyed by the knights. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The wind was howling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Then, the demons&rsquo; aura vanished from the land.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">In the past, this land once was a small nation named Silberia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Its quaint towns stood tall, surrounding a beautiful lake. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Today, there&rsquo;s not a trace of that left. The lakeshore is dyed scarlet by blood, its reddish-brown water reaches as deep as the sea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The laughter of demons echoes day and night. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The ancient city is a tombstone.
