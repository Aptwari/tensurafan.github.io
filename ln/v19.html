But even so, he couldn’t help but hope. A world without Veldanava was of no value to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

<p id="line_27"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> opened his eyes. He shook his head lightly to shake off the lingering sentiment. He couldn’t help but feel a bit confused at the feeling, as if his emotions were being exposed for the first time.</p>
<p id="line_28"><em>I thought that I wasn’t as naive as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rudra" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but I guess I was wrong.</em></p>
<p id="line_29">In the end, that was the conclusion. Trust no one and use everyone as pawns—If that had been done that from the start, then <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s betrayal could have been prevented. He hadn’t done that because he believed in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He thought that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s friends, the people he trusted, would also be trustworthy to himself. But that was a mistake. When the Ultimate Skill ‘Salvation King Azrael’ that he had tethered to his hand had returned, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> realized that he had failed.</p>
<p id="line_30"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had betrayed them. She had used her administrative privileges to erase ‘Salvation King Azrael’ and escape from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s control. In order to make up for that loss, he had used <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to reinforce his control over the Angelic Skill Holders currently under control through the Ultimate Dominion.</p>
<p id="line_31"><em>With that, there is no problem with the Phantoms. The Insectars may betray us, but our interests are still aligned. Monitoring will be essential, but once the battlefield is prepared, we’ll be able to handle the rest.</em></p>
<p id="line_32">The battlefield was the land where the contract with the Insectars took place. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had promised <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Zelanus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that he could carve out any area he wanted and make it his domain. That’s right. If anyone lived there, the Insectars would take care of them. In other words, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> intended to send <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Zelanus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to the fiercest battleground. The location would slowly be determined, but there were several problems. The first, needless to say, was how to deal with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s betrayal.</p>
<p id="line_33">The Phantoms were loyal to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, so there was no need to worry about a drop in morale. He could have even postponed the decision, judging by the threat level, but he had a feeling that it would be a bad idea. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s role had been to monitor the ‘World-destroying Dragon’ Ivarage. Now, however, that importance had been diminished. Whatever happened in the Otherworld was none of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s concern, and if anything, the situation of Ivarage’s manifestation in the Cardinal World was incorporated into his strategy. In other words, he didn’t care if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> abandoned her mission. However, it would be a different story if she tried to cooperate with the enemy forces such as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. In order to nip such concerns in the bud, taking the initiative seemed more certain.</p>
<p id="line_34">So, who should they send? That was the main question. This was also related to the following issue. Should they proceed to the next target as planned? If they were going to take out <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, shouldn’t the plan be revised? This was not a trivial matter. After all, the troops under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s command were a part of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s army. The loss of strength due to his mistake made <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> feel uncomfortable. This was also a new experience for him.</p>
<p id="line_35">Emotion was something that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, as a Manas, had a difficult time understanding. And yet, recently, his thoughts had been disturbed like a noise in a song. So he suddenly had the thought to enjoy the feeling.</p>
<p id="line_36"><em>If this is an ‘emotion,’ then perhaps I should consider myself lucky. Even if there is only one perfect answer, there are innumerable ways to get there. The shortest way is not necessarily the right way, so I can be forgiven for enjoying the process.</em></p>
<p id="line_37">If one’s emotions are disturbed every time a problem arises, then it is better to just enjoy it. Impatience narrowed one’s field of vision, and anger would dull the thinking. Regret was meaningless, and the most constructive thing to do was to avoid making more mistakes in the future. If that was the case, then he had found a solution to his current problem.</p>
<p id="line_38">“…That’s right. I, myself, should defeat the rebels.”</p>
<p id="line_39">Any losses should be recovered within the day. Rather than imposing one’s own mistakes onto others, it was better to make up for them as soon as possible. That way, he would not have to worry about opening more wounds and would be able to calmly tackle the next problem. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s mood lifted as soon as he came to that conclusion. It was also his first time ever experiencing this—</p>
<p id="line_40"><em>‘Emotions’ are not so bad after all.</em></p>
<p id="line_41">That’s what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> felt.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_42">In the Otherworld, there is no such thing as gravity. It is similar to outer space in that there is no concept of earth and sky. There are only objects made of condensed magicules scattered throughout the empty space. Such objects were as strong as magisteel, and generated powerful gravitational forces, so they were processed to be used as ‘bases’<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The word used for ‘bases’ is ‘Kyoten (拠点)’ also meaning ‘location/position,’ or ‘point’—kind of like a foundational point/base point." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>. The former angels, the Phantoms, used such bases to live a life similar to one in the Cardinal World, so as not to forget their lives in a gravitational field. The base of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, which was comparable in size to an asteroid, was the frontline base against Ivarage. Its strength was unrivaled by any other bases and was one of the most important facilities for the Phantoms. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> jumped towards that base.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_43">When ‘Spatial Transportation’ was used from the Heavenly Star Palace, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s base was already empty. However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> immediately sensed the presence of a large army nearby.</p>
<p id="line_44"><em>Over there</em>—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought, as he turned his gaze.</p>
<p id="line_45"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also seemed to have noticed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s presence and immediately responded by taking an intercepting stance. With unhindered movements, she and the others had formed a full-blown formation and turned their hostility towards <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Because there was no ground and sky, the type of formation was different from that on earth. A ‘full-sky formation’ was a tactic that was built on the premise that the enemy was small in number. It aimed at annihilation of the enemy by encircling them from above, below, right, and left.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Basically, the enemy is surrounded on all angles, even from below because there is no ground." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> It was a successful formation against cryptids.</p>
<p id="line_46">The cryptids were specialized in their individual fighting ability and rarely swarmed together. Therefore, using a tactic that encircled them in large numbers was very effective. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had always been at the forefront of the battle, and her command was excellent. The soldiers who responded to her were also worthy of praise.</p>
<p id="line_47"><em>Ah, it really is a shame. At any rate, I wish I could have made better use of this force—</em></p>
<p id="line_48"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sighed. These were the people who had been holding off the cryptids for so long. Their usefulness was impeccable, and it would be a shame to lose them here. However, there was no room left for negotiation. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s decision to eliminate the traitors and make up the losses was unwavering even in the face of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others.</p>

<p id="line_51">“Your actions were meaningful in that they made me aware of my mistakes. However, you should understand that there is no forgiveness for that.”</p>
<p id="line_52">“Of course, I am not going to ask for your forgiveness. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, was it?

<p id="line_53">The intentions of both parties were confirmed.

Hundreds of thousands of troops moved at her will, filling the other world with the light of annihilation. Using the full-sky formation, the soldiers were deployed in three dimensions, forming a hemisphere. The front was lined up with defense specialists, and the back rows were constantly attacking as layers were replaced over and over. This made it seem as if it was filled with light. Light converged on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> from all sides of the hemisphere. An army trained to battle cryptids could function without problems, even at the scale of the entire army. The energy wave offensive, which emphasized efficiency to the utmost, was unleashed continuously even as the troops were replaced. Naturally, there was no way to avoid them, so <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was directly hit by the concentrated fire.</p>

<h1 class="ch-name">The First Battle</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_97">The place where we transported was extremely frigid. A world of silver. It was as if we had wandered into <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s castle. I had tried to use the ‘magic transfer circle,’ but the spell did not work. Therefore, I used ‘Spatial Transportation’ to reach the limit of what I could see with my surveillance spell ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Argus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ and was greeted by a stinging cold air. It was freezing to the core. It must have been ‘that.’ I was able to nullify the cold, but the fact that I still felt a chill was definitely due to Velzard’s influence. There was a presence in the air that made the air tremble, telling me that this was definitely a battlefield. The greatest source of power was coming from the battlefield where <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Velzard were facing each other. They had created a deadly space where no one could intervene.</p>
<p id="line_98">So, I’d just leave that part alone. I thought I felt someone looking at me, but I just ignored it. I felt like I had been hit by a wave of anger saying, ‘You bastard, you just ignored me!<em>‘</em> but it wasn’t good to overthink things. I’m just an extra, so it’s probably best if I don’t intervene.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_99">«…»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_100">I could feel someone’s dismay, but my conclusion remained unshakable. Jumping into a situation that you know is dangerous is not a choice that a wise man should make. On that note, I should find out where I can intervene. The next option is—let’s see, it’s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. His opponent is Zalario, so let’s ignore that one too.</p>
<p id="line_101">Oh well. It’s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, so it should be fine to just leave it to him. If he can’t handle it, then there’s nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_102">«No, that’s not—»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_103">Tsk, tsk, you don’t understand, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. I’ve noticed recently that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s been slacking off whenever I’m watching him. He’s probably not aware of it, but it feels like he’s not working because he wants to see what I can do.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_104">«…I see, that makes sense.»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_105">Oh, it’s been quite a while since I last beat <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san to the punch. I’m feeling good, but I’ll just go ahead and give instructions to everyone.</p>
<p id="line_106">“Leave the outside alone, we’re heading for Leon. It looks like there are a few battlefields, so please deal with them as you see fit!”</p>
<p id="line_107"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Ranga and Kumara nodded at my decision. Roughly speaking, this was an emergency. For the time being, I decided that it would be best if we all went together. By the way, was there another battlefield out here? There was. I could sense a thick magical residue near the ground.</p>
<p id="line_108">But…my instinctive intuition told me to ignore it. Why was that? Without any reason or evidence, I decided to follow it. Well, now was not the time to be troubled, so I decided to take immediate action. Everyone seemed to have no objection, and we all began moving towards the castle.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 19/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_109">The visibility was terrible. I was doing my best to activate ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Universal Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ but I couldn’t even get a sense of distance. The reason was simple—Velzard’s snowstorm was contaminated with magicules. That’s why the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Natural Effects Nullification" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ was disabled. As long as we were sensing distance using the reflection of magicules in the atmosphere, everything would become ambiguous if the space was filled with magicules. So, all we could do was to move in the direction where the magicules were shaking. That ended up being the correct answer, and we soon reached Leon’s castle.</p>
<p id="line_110">The inside of the castle was better. I was relieved to have my sight back. And so, I looked for signs of battle.</p>
<p id="line_111">“All right, I’ve detected a sign of Leon. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I will head out, so you guys go support the rest of the battlefields.”</p>
<p id="line_112">“Understood!”</p>
<p id="line_113">“I understand!”</p>
<p id="line_114">“Leave it to me.”</p>
<p id="line_115">Without any objection to my order, Ranga, Kumara, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> moved out.

A chilling presence. The energy was so intense that it exceeded my current full power, and I decided that this would be dangerous. The scene at the end of the transport was a true race against time. I performed ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Thought Acceleration" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ at several hundred million times the speed and tried to read the situation—</p>

I don’t know what had happened to her, but she seemed to have regained her free will. No, the current problem was not that, but rather the gigantic fireball that the enemy was about to unleash.</p>
<p id="line_117">Strengthened by an ultimate skill, its heat and destructive power had been increased to such an extent that it could shatter even the spirit. In other words, it would even destroy the soul. And it had already been unleashed. I would be safe.

In such a case, you should decide the game with a killing blow.</p>
<p id="line_142">That’s right, I had prepared it for such a situation. In all times and places, it was the thing that all shounen manga protagonists had—the sure-kill technique.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Another translation can be ‘special move,’ but I am sticking with ‘sure-kill technique’ from here on out due to consistency, and because I think it is a more accurate translation than ‘special move.’ If there are any One Piece fans out there, the kanji is actually quite similar to Usopp’s ‘sure-kill’ shots which is partly why I went with that translation." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span></p>
<p id="line_143">“Imaginary Blade!!”</p>
<p id="line_144">If someone were to ask what the <em>strongest</em> sword technique against an individual was, the answer would be obvious. It was the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Melt Slash" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ which could even slice through the spirit. Then, if someone were to ask what the <em>best</em> sword technique against an individual was, the answer would be the Haze style (Oboro-Hyakka Ryouran). Combining both of these characteristics was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s special move, the ‘Oboro-Kokuen Hyakka Ryouran<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The Kanji that was used in this technique is the same as the ‘Oboro -- Hyakka Ryouran’ except for the added ‘Kokuen’ part which means ‘Black Flames.’ Very fitting for a Benimaru technique." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>,’ which can be considered his sure-kill technique.</p>
<p id="line_145">This sword art was the highest form of the technique, but with the ultimate skill added to increase its power. Therefore, its power had been raised to the realm of shattering the spirit, making it comparable to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Melt Slash" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> technique. There is no doubt that it was the strongest in terms of both power and skill. And then, I had a thought. I can’t lose to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you know?</p>
<p id="line_146">So I asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san to come up with a useful sure-kill technique. Of course, I also gave my own opinion. I asked it to use ‘Turn Null,’ which I still had a difficult time understanding even after it was explained to me, and to make it more powerful. That is how the ‘Imaginary Blade’ was born. Rather than slashing through the spirit, this technique eats it. It’s the main characteristic of this technique. Because it eats the target and throws it into ‘Imaginary Space,’ it has a broken<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Broken as in it has a cheat-like foul play." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> performance that is virtually impossible to defend against.</p>
<p id="line_147">The only effective way to counter this is to avoid it. Even if it is caught with a sword, because it has a one-hit kill effect<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="I think that this part is like a better version of Hinata’s Dead End Rainbow attack that has the 7-hit kill effect." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>, the battle ends immediately. One of my aesthetics was that ‘a sure-kill technique should be a sure-kill technique.’ It’s a matter of course for my friends that the second time was not the charm. If a technique is shown even once, the opponent will take countermeasures, so the best thing to do is to not show anyone your sure-kill technique until it’s time for the actual performance.</p>
<p id="line_148">Well, there was also a way to deal with that using ‘Parallel Existence’ like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Velgrynd" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but when it came to a battle between high-ranking spiritual life forms, the main focus was the scramble for energy… In other words, the one who exhausted their opponent first was the winner. Although it was no longer an Insta-kill, it was still a terrific sure-kill move. At this stage of the battle, I generously revealed my sure-kill technique with a strong will to kill <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on the spot.

<p class="space-break" id="line_155"><em>Pfffft!!</em></p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_159">Phew. Let’s just forget it. These things just happen. He had caught the sword easily as if it were a joke, and it seemed to have upset him a bit. I switched my mind and focused on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san had already started investigating the cause of the blockage before I did. It would be pointless to attack again until the results were out, but I needed to pretend that I didn’t care about that. I decided to bluff my way into a conversation with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_160">“Wow, you blocked that really well.”</p>
<p id="line_161">Pretending that I wasn’t upset inside, I slashed at him and tried to talk to him. I thought that I would be ignored, but he unexpectedly responded to me.</p>
<p id="line_162">“When I think about how attached the Black King (Noir) is to you, I don’t feel threatened at all.”</p>
<p id="line_163">He’s got an annoying way of saying things.

<p class="space-break" id="line_164">«No, it’s unnatural. I don’t think there is anyone who wouldn’t feel threatened by it.

<p class="space-break" id="line_165">You say that, but in reality, it didn’t work at all. At this rate, even the ‘Abyss Annihilation,’ which I learned from watching <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the labyrinth, might not work. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s sword appeared to be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and ‘Imaginary Blade’ did not work either. Of course, that meant that the backwards-compatible ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Melt Slash" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ would be useless as well. In that case, one might think that slashing at the body would be enough, but this was not so easy. Because this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> guy was quite skilled.</p>
<p id="line_166">When I crossed swords with him, I felt that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s abilities were considerable. He was as good as or better than me in terms of pure swordsmanship alone.

Since I had become a True Dragon race, my physical abilities had increased greatly. It was not a metaphor, but I was now able to move several times faster than before. In addition, I thought that my skill with the sword had also improved, but I still couldn’t get to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_167">In such a situation, the best thing to do was to switch to using magic attacks, which swords could not receive. However, large-scale magic would cause a lot of damage to Leon’s kingdom. So, the only other option was to use magic for individuals. The ‘Abyss Annihilation’ that I just mentioned had a destructive power that could affect the entire planet, so it couldn’t be used anyway. However, I used it as an example because it was one the highest classes of magic in terms of power. When it came to anti-personnel magic, I couldn’t really think of anything that could surpass it. ‘Disintegration’ was barely comparable to it, and anything else would just be guessing. The simple anti-personnel nuclear magic: Nuclear Cannon, was not nearly as powerful as Disintegration…</p>
<p id="line_168">Even if an ultimate skill was used to increase the power, it could be dealt with if the opponent also had an ultimate skill. Even without it, there was no way to make it hit.

If he started to fight back, I wouldn’t be able to afford it. At the moment, it seemed that the best thing to do was to try to find a way out of the situation through conversation. I started talking so as not to let him know how irritated I was.</p>
<p id="line_169">“I’m just a harmless slime. It’s only natural that I don’t seem like a threat.”</p>
<p id="line_170">“Hmph, you’re talking out of your ass. That’s the kind of thing that makes you seem just like master and slave.”</p>
<p id="line_171">“That doesn’t make you happy?”</p>
<p id="line_172">“Well. You’re just a hindrance to me, so I have no reason to be pleased. If that makes you uncomfortable, then that’s just a bonus.”</p>
<p id="line_173">I thought he would just ignore me, but surprisingly, the conversation continued. That made this all the more disappointing. If I couldn’t communicate with the other party, defeating them with no hesitation became much easier…</p>
<p id="line_174">Well, I was currently in the middle of searching for a successful strategy, so I didn’t have the time to think about it from a different perspective anyway.

However, the same was true for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who was not receiving damage.</p>

One strategy was to use a sword technique that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could not catch. To be perfectly honest, I had another secret technique up my sleeve. It was an improved version of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘Hyakka Ryouran,’ and could not be used without <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s full support. I was hesitant to use it because it was a technique that exceeded my current skill-level and made me feel like I was cheating.</p>
<p id="line_176">But now was not the time for such things, and I considered using it when the opportunity presented itself—but I just couldn’t picture it succeeding. There was something ominous about it all. It seemed that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san agreed with me, and I decided to give priority to finding out <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s secrets for now. That’s why we were currently in an indefinite battle, but when I thought about it more deeply, it was also a good time to calmly check the other battle situations. I was also concerned about the safety of the others.

His opponent seemed superior in all aspects, so I tried to observe the situation with ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Universal Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ without looking at him.</p>
<p id="line_178"><em>Hm?!</em></p>
<p id="line_179">Jahil was wielding a ghastly blood-colored spear. I had no idea when or from where he brought it out, but I could feel a tremendous power coming from that spear.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_180">«It seems that the spear is called the Origin Blood Spear. <em>‘This spear, given to me by the Divine Ancestor, will pierce you through!’</em> That’s what he said.»</p>

Well, it’s true that we couldn’t be too careful, but we weren’t necessarily in a bad situation. If worse came to worst, I still had Veldora, so even if I died, I could be revived. It could be said that I didn’t have a high enough sense of danger, but it wasn’t worth being impatient until I found a way to attack. And so, I continued my observations.</p>
<p id="line_183">I wasn’t sure of what kind of existence Jahil was, but he didn’t look uncomfortable even though he had taken over <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. In other words, his movements were light, and his spear wielding was very good. Because I had increased my perception speed by several hundred million times, I could clearly see that he fought like an expert. It was hard to believe that he was using someone else’s body, and that only made obvious just how troublesome Jahil was. And moreover…</p>
<p id="line_184">Jahil’s existence value was over three times that of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s, and what’s more, that spear, the Origin Blood, was estimated to have an existence value of more than ten million. Such a weapon should be illegal.</p>
<p id="line_185">Since we were outside Ramiris’ labyrinth, I couldn’t calculate the exact values, but the overall difference in strength between them was more than four times.

In other words, if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> did not have his ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Heat King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Amaterasu’ he would have been defeated long ago.

<p id="line_186">If that was the case, I wanted to help him out right now.

<p id="line_187">This one was an indefinite draw.

Since they were able read the other’s movements, they were stuck in an indefinite draw. There wasn’t going to be an easy way to settle this. Any help couldn’t be expected, but the fact that support wasn’t immediately needed could be considered quite lucky.</p>

If you can afford to observe all this, then shouldn’t you help me out a bit?”</p>
<p id="line_192">Oh, she’s quite the perceptive person. She caught me scrutinizing their battle. I couldn’t actually afford to do much either, but it’s true that I had been observing the other battles, so it was hard to refute her. In that case, I had no choice but to answer as honestly as I could.</p>
<p id="line_193">“I’m sorry. I didn’t have anything better to do, so I couldn’t help looking over my shoulder.”</p>
<p id="line_194">“Hah? What kind of nerves do you have to do something like that when you can’t even afford it? I had heard from El-chan that you didn’t have any common sense, but you—you really should take things more seriously.”</p>
<p id="line_195">That was undeniably true. I wasn’t expecting to be found out, so I had let my guard down, but it was certainly out of the ordinary to look away in the middle of a battle.</p>
<p id="line_196">“I shall take your suggestions back with me and consider them seriously.”<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="It should be noted that Rimuru speaks more formal/robotically in this sentence.

<p id="line_197">“Hmm, it sounds like you’re not interested in reforming at all, but whatever. So, do you think you can win?”</p>
<p id="line_198">Very perceptive, this one. I was planning to play it off lightly, but she saw right through me. I really had to start taking this more seriously, or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was going to think I was crazy.

Unexpectedly, he joined in on the conversation.</p>
<p id="line_201">“Heh, I’m the one who should be surprised that you’re looking away while fighting me. And yet, you say that ‘there’s no room for an opening’? How ridiculous. From who’s mouth are you speaking from?”</p>
<p id="line_202">“Shut up! It’s only because I showed you my trump card and you blocked it so easily! If you’d have just let yourself get hit by that, I wouldn’t have had to go through all this trouble!”</p>
<p id="line_203">“Don’t make me laugh. If you bastards hadn’t interfered with me, our plan would have come to fruition much earlier. In the first place, you should realize how many of our plans have been foiled because of your servant, the Black King Noir!”</p>
<p id="line_204">It seems that I was too aggressive and had made him angry.</p>
<p id="line_205">“I had nothing to do with those <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> incidents.”</p>

<p id="line_207">“No, we haven’t known each other for that long.”</p>
<p id="line_208">I have a policy for not taking on unnecessary responsibility. I firmly insisted that I was not at fault here.</p>
<p id="line_209">“You really are a cheeky one.”</p>
<p id="line_210">“Hm, I agree. You’re pretty incredible. I almost respect you for being so relaxed in this kind of situation!”</p>
<p id="line_211">That was not a compliment. I mean, you should just be focusing on Leon! Just kidding. I’d never say that out loud, because that would be like treading on the tail of a snake.</p>
<p id="line_212">“By the way, who are you?”</p>
<p id="line_213">“Oh, me? I’m El-chan’s mom. You can just call me Silvia!”</p>
<p id="line_214">That was a surprising introduction. Well, elves were a long-lived species, so I suppose it could be the case…but I still felt like I wouldn’t easily be able to nod my head in agreement even if El-tan called her mother right in front of me. The common sense of my previous life got in the way too much. When I glanced over at her, I saw that she was fighting a very close battle to the extent that it was strange that she even found the time to talk.</p>
<p id="line_215">Both Leon and Silvia-san were dodging each other’s swords by the slimmest of margins and counterattacking, as if they had practiced it beforehand. This person seemed to have a lot of guts if she could speak casually under such circumstances.</p>
<p id="line_216">“So, do you think Leon will be able to pull through? You’re his master, aren’t you?”</p>
<p id="line_217">“Ah, you caught that? I won’t deny that I’m his master, but I don’t think I can do anything about this. To be honest, I didn’t expect Leon-kun to be this strong…”</p>
<p id="line_218">That response sounded playful, but it was probably the truth. Those two had been walking a tightrope since before we arrived, so it was no wonder that they had lost their concentration. The current state of equilibrium would collapse if any part of it was missing, so it certainly wasn’t the time to be complacent. But then… I was left wondering what to do about Leon.</p>
<p id="line_219">I did have a plan for dealing with Leon, but I wasn’t sure if I should go through with it. In any case, I wanted to aim for a more effective timing, but right now didn’t seem to be the right time. The situation was severe, but we were still in equilibrium. I felt that if I overreacted now, I might end up putting us all in danger. I would continue to wait and see about Leon. As I was making such a decision, I received a complaint from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

<p id="line_221">How unusual, for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to be complaining—well, I guess it was understandable. A power difference of more than four times was too severe.</p>
<p id="line_222">“It’s bad?”</p>
<p id="line_223">“It’s really bad.”</p>
<p id="line_224">That’s right. It was fortunate that Jahil specialized in flames because it gave <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> an advantage in terms of compatibility. He would have been defeated long ago otherwise, so even the current situation was miraculous. Now then, what to do…</p>
<p id="line_225">The battle would be decided once the equilibrium was broken, but even I didn’t have the strength to do so. I had a few hidden trump cards, but it was difficult to know when to use them. As for the opponents, aside from Leon, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Jahil were too much at ease. We were overwhelmingly at a disadvantage. In that case, perhaps I should kill the enemies elsewhere and wait for someone to rush in, or even perform <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Summoning, one of our trump cards, and call in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. However, I was afraid that if I did that, my opponent would be able to do the same thing, and things would quickly go out of hand. After all, the best option was to wait and see for a while.</p>
<p id="line_226">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-kun, please do your best just a little longer!”</p>
<p id="line_227">“Wai—seriously, I can’t buy that much time, you know?!”</p>
<p id="line_228">It’s been a long time since I had heard such a pathetic reply coming from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 19/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_229">Ranga, Kumara, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had separated from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and each of them was heading to support a different battlefield. They did not consult with one another in particular, but had naturally decided on where to go based on the general strength of the enemy.</p>
<p id="line_230">The opponent Ranga was headed for was Vega. He was the one who was giving off the strongest presence, even stronger than Ranga’s. And as expected, it was the fiercest battleground.</p>
<p id="line_231"><em>Hmm, he seems to be stronger than me, but if we bide our time, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono and the others should be able to dispose of the enemy and rush to our aid…</em></p>
<p id="line_232">Ranga trusted his friends. That is why he was able to take on the strongest of opponents with no fear and no doubts.</p>
<p id="line_233">“I shall assist you!”</p>
<p id="line_234">Ranga shouted and jumped at Vega. Maetel was delighted by this. White Knight Maetel, the leader of the White Knights under Leon, had desperately been trying to recover, but there was a limit to how much time he could buy with his current strength. The five <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon peer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raine" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mizeri" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s command—Misora, Squall, Ulrich, Alban, and Georg—were all as powerful as the old <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. However, their opponent, Vega, had an existence value of more than ten million, and the difference in their abilities was too great.</p>
<p id="line_235">Misora, the Duke-class commander, was very talented as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raine" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s second-in-command. She was always looking after <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raine" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who tended to slack off, and she possessed a broad perspective with good leadership. But even so, there was no room for effective leadership when some of them had been crippled by Vega’s attacks. In spite of this, the battle line did not collapse thanks to Misora’s efforts. And it was Maetel’s restoration magic that desperately supported this.</p>
<p id="line_236">Normally, these proud <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were very individualistic, but with the cooperation of all five of them, they managed to maintain the front line, even making full use of illusion magic to deceive. However, when Ulrich and Alban fell at the same time, the burden on those who remained increased. Maetel’s recovery magic could not keep up, and total annihilation was imminent. It was at this critical moment that Ranga intervened.</p>
<p id="line_237">“What the hell, you dog! You dare to interfere with me!”</p>
<p id="line_238">Vega was on a high. Now that he had so much power, he believed himself to be invincible. That’s why he decided that one more <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wouldn’t be much of a threat. But that was a mistake. Ranga’s existence value was less than half of Vega’s, but his combat experience was not to be underestimated. Because he was always lurking in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s shadow, he had witnessed many battles. That is why Ranga was able to flexibly adapt his tactics to the enemy. This time, the strategic victory would be to get through this without any casualties. By understanding that, his role became more clear.</p>
<p id="line_239">“Use me as a shield and regroup. Reinforcements will definitely come. My lord will not be defeated!”</p>
<p id="line_240">Wagging his tail, Ranga assured them. With that alone, Misora and the others understood that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had arrived. Misora accurately read Ranga’s intentions and figured out what the best course of action would be.</p>
<p id="line_241">“I shall take your word for it. Maetel-dono, please concentrate on Ranga-dono.”</p>
<p id="line_242">And with that, the tactics were swiftly rearranged, and the battle changed with Ranga as the focal point. From this point on, Vega’s high would come to an end. This was because Ranga, whom Vega had initially dismissed as inferior, performed better than expected. Without thinking, Vega attempted to eliminate Ranga. By using his Ultimate Skill ‘Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka’ to the fullest extent, he tried to subdue him with pure power.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_243">The Ultimate Skill, ‘Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka,’ was a skill acquired after Vega’s upbringing. Vega was descended from the ‘magical inquisitors,’ one of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s research achievements. He was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that possessed both <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and human characteristics, and could recover from any injury as long as he was fed. It was a secret that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had modified him to become a kind of imitation slime.</p>
<p id="line_244">Vega’s whole body was a collection of miniscule magical bacteria. Therefore, he could regenerate freely, and as long as a single part of his body remained, he could be revived without any problems. He was able to mimic the structure of living organisms, and depending on the probability, he could even acquire the Skill of the opponent after Predation. It was precisely because of this that Vega was able to acquire the Ultimate Skill ‘Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka.’</p>
<p id="line_245">The true value of this skill was that it absorbed the power of the eaten target, just like the Vega’s essential nature. It was a power very similar to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gluttonous King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Beelzebuth" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ and was an aggregation of terrifying abilities such as ‘Ultraspeed Thought,’ ‘Parallel Thought,’ ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ ‘Organic Domination,’ ‘Mass Reproduction,’ ‘Skill Absorption,’ and ‘Multilayer Barrier.’</p>
<p id="line_246">It had an extremely high performance. If the victim had a physical body, it’s information could be read using ‘Organic Domination’ and its racial abilities could be acquired. Even if the victim was a spiritual life form, it was possible to steal away its energy using ‘Skill Absorption’ and even make its Skills their own. On top of that, as long as there was an organic body to use as a material, the user could mass-produce and manipulate ‘replicas’ of themselves. The Ultimate Skill ‘Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka’ was a skill that, if it could be mastered, could help the wielder become as strong as they wished. If it could be mastered…</p>
<p id="line_247">Unfortunately, Vega hadn’t had that much experience since he was born. He had grown at an alarming rate, and his power had only increased, but he had yet to master his own powers. Vega could only use ‘Organic Domination’ to strengthen his body, ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ to understand his enemies’ weaknesses, and ‘Skill Absorption’ to weaken his enemies. He also used ‘Ultraspeed Thought’ unconsciously, so he was able to make good decisions, but unfortunately, he could not use ‘Parallel Thinking,’ and was unable to claim victory despite having an overwhelming advantage. However, Vega himself was enjoying his strength so much that he didn’t even realize that he had missed his best chance…</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_248">—And with a vicious power, Vega’s fist pierced through Ranga.</p>
<p id="line_249">“—Hm?”</p>
<p id="line_250">Vega wondered at the lack of response. He should have pierced through him, but he couldn’t feel anything. Let alone stealing energy, he could not even use ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ on the enemy. The reason for this was that Ranga was using his own abilities to the fullest. Ranga’s ultimate skill, ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Stellar Wind King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Hastur,’ had the effect of transforming his body into a magical wind.</p>
<p id="line_251">Physical attacks would not work against Ranga, who had turned into a terrifying ‘demonic wind’ that contaminated everything it touched. In fact, the moment something touched Ranga, it would be damaged by the ‘death-calling wind.’ The current Ranga was magic itself.</p>
<p id="line_252">The logic was the same as that of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s Burst Roar; He maintained his regular form and mass but was transformed into a willful particle of destructive energy not unlike a spiritual life form. Even a simple physical attack would become an attack of great destructive power. One did not need an explanation to understand how terrifying this was. Furthermore, unlike with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, this was not Ranga using a special move, but rather undergoing a change in state. Naturally, the rate of energy consumption would be higher, but there would be no restrictions placed on him just for entering a ‘magical wind’ state.</p>
<p id="line_253">This was the power of someone who could utilize their Skill to the fullest extent. Although Vega was superior in terms of existence value, Ranga was the winner in terms of ability.</p>
<p id="line_254">“Hahaha, that fist doesn’t seem to work on me, does it?”</p>
<p id="line_255">Actually, Ranga was surprised. He had expected Vega to be stronger and had been wary of him. Because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was always so cautious, Ranga learned to imitate him. That is why he never let his guard down against Vega, who possessed more than twice the amount of energy as he did. On the contrary, he even suspected that this was a trap of some kind.</p>
<p id="line_256">“Damn you! You have no respect, even though you’re just a dog!”</p>
<p id="line_257">And after Vega tried to hit him, he realized for the first time that the other party was an idiot. If he had hit Ranga, who had turned into magical wind, without thinking, the result would have been the same as hurting himself. Vega would have taken the damage on his own, and Ranga was left dumbfounded. In this case, the correct answer was to wrap your fist in a skill-enhanced aura and then hit him. The same applied to attacking with weapons. Skills could only be dealt with by skills.</p>
<p id="line_258">If he was a spiritual life form, he could be as effective as an ultimate skill by increasing his energy, but Vega did not take any of that into consideration. If he had mastered his Ultimate Skill ‘Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka,’ he would not have shown such a disgraceful appearance.</p>
<p id="line_259">“You fool. I thought you were playing a trick on me, but it looks like you were actually serious. In that case, I shall make my move at once.”</p>
<p id="line_260">As soon as Ranga announced this, he began to run at full speed. He became a jet-black wind that tossed Vega around, leaving the sound behind and filling the space with afterimages from the earth to the sky. Then, it became a howling that reverberated inside the space. Ranga amplified his own speed and destructive power through the ‘Sound and Wind Domination’ of the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Stellar Wind King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Hastur,’ and then created a force field using ‘Spatial Domination’ while running at full speed. After that, he created a ‘Death Storm’ within the force field by using ‘Weather Domination’ for the final blow—this eventually lead to the ‘Apocalypse’ that destroyed everything.</p>
<p id="line_261">This technique was called ‘Apocalypse Howling.’ It was the most powerful individual attack technique that Ranga had devised. Incidentally, if one made a howling roar, they could also fire it as a directional beam. Normally, that would be the simpler and more correct way to use it. However, if one wanted to cause more damage, it was better to use a beam that was confined to a certain space, as was the case in this situation. By confining the target, there was no waste of energy, so a greater effect was to be expected.</p>
<p id="line_262">Vega took a direct hit from this, but surprisingly, he survived. Although he was not able to use the ‘Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka’ properly, he was still subconsciously affected by the skill in his body. Moreover, Vega could be characterized by his stubbornness. Although he was not left unharmed, he was able to regenerate his own body in time before being killed by activating ‘Organic Domination’ and ‘Mass Reproduction.’ His magicule count was not to be underestimated. Vega took a deep breath and bellowed with all his might.</p>
<p id="line_263">“Shit, shit, shiiiiiiit!!”</p>
<p id="line_264">Then he glared at Ranga. Vega took a deep breath to calm himself down, and then spat out.</p>
<p id="line_265">“Damn it! It’s been a long series of continuous battles, and it looks like I’m tired too. I’ll call it a draw for today, so prepare yourself for the next time we meet! See ya.”</p>
<p id="line_266">Vega’s cowardice was the only reason why he was so good at sensing danger. Realizing that the situation had become disadvantageous for him, he immediately decided to run away. Ranga had no objections. From the fact that he had withstood his own strongest move, he could see that Vega was superior to him in terms of existence value. He understood that he could not defeat Vega unless he was able to finish him off with that current blow. In that case, there was no need to push himself. His tactical goal was to buy time, so if he could force Vega to retreat, then that would be considered a success. Therefore, Ranga’s decision to not engage Vega was the correct choice.</p>
<p id="line_267">Thus, the battle against Vega, the fiercest of the battlefields, came to an end.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_268">Now then, everyone was pleased by Ranga’s support, however—</p>
<p id="line_269">Misora thought to herself.</p>
<p id="line_270"><em>This Ranga fellow is the pet of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, isn’t he? So then why is he so strong?!</em></p>
<p id="line_271">That strength was just illogical. Misora had a rough idea of how large or small Vega and Ranga’s energy values were. This was because a good fighter could not survive if they were unable to measure the strength of their enemy. In Misora’s perspective, Ranga was a serious contender, but Vega still seemed to be a more formidable opponent. And yet, Ranga had been the overwhelming victor. She had planned to use Ranga as a shield and reconfigure her tactics, but now she felt like she had been let down.</p>
<p id="line_272"><em>“You know, Misora, there are some extraordinary beings in this world. Once you take a good look at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, you will understand how I feel right now.”</em></p>
<p id="line_273">Misora remembered the words of her boss (<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raine" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>).</p>
<p id="line_274">“I see now…just by watching his pet, one can understand the caliber of the owner. I did not doubt <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raine" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s words, but now I understand them wholeheartedly.”</p>
<p id="line_275">Misora couldn’t help muttering, and the four remaining <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon peer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s nodded their heads in total agreement. And White Knight Maetel, who had almost run out of mana, was left dumbfounded that he had no part to play. It was as if they had escaped reality.</p>
<p id="line_276"><em>I like dogs, and I’ve always wanted to have one. They’re just so dependable. After this battle, I’ll have to rush to the pet store to buy one!</em></p>
<p id="line_277">It was a complete abandonment of thought. By the way, pet stores in this world did not sell pet dogs. They sold animals and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that were trained by a tamer and could really fight, at a high price. Later on, Maetel would buy a forest wolf and give it the name ‘Ranga II,’ but that was another story.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 19/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_278">Red Knight Fran and Yellow Knight Kizona were struggling against Oria. The word ‘struggling’ was an understatement. If Oria had seriously intended to kill them, the battle would have instantly been decided.</p>
<p id="line_279">“Kuh, she’s just too strong…”</p>
<p id="line_280">Fran muttered, biting her lip. Kizona, who was exposed to Oria’s attack, agreed.</p>
<p id="line_281">“She’s just toying with us. Now it’s a mace? It was a short-sword earlier, but she’s making the weapons weaker and weaker, testing their performance on us.”</p>
<p id="line_282">Kizona’s point was correct. At first, Oria was holding a morning star.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="A medieval club-like weapon consisting of a shaft connected to a round spiked ball. Similar to a mace." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> With one blow, Kizona’s full body armor had been shattered. The next blow would have killed her, but Oria’s next move was to switch weapons. Kizona felt as if she was being taken for a fool, but it was also true that she felt lucky.</p>
<p id="line_283">“It’s disgraceful to be ridiculed like this, but I guess it can’t be helped since there’s such a large difference between our abilities…”</p>
<p id="line_284">“Let’s think positively. If we keep stalling for time, I am sure that Leon-sama will come to help!”</p>
<p id="line_285">Fran and Kizona were determined to not give up and face Oria with an unrealistic hope. They both understood that such hope was an illusion. Their master, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon, must be in an even more treacherous situation. Otherwise, Leon would not have abandoned his subordinates. So, all they could do was try to stay alive until help arrived.</p>
<p id="line_286">But that was long overdue. The disparity in their abilities was too great. Not even ten minutes had passed since the battle had started, and they were already wounded to the bone. And Oria was also satisfied after testing her abilities to some extent.</p>
<p id="line_287">“Yeah. Is that enough?”</p>
<p id="line_288">Oria spoke and transformed her weapon into the ‘Trident.’ It was the main weapon of a woman who had once been named Orca. Fran and Kizona also understood that Oria’s presence had changed.</p>
<p id="line_289"><em>So this is it… I did my best, but I regret that I couldn’t complete my mission…</em></p>
<p id="line_290">Fran was despairing. Kizona was more materialistic.</p>
<p id="line_291"><em>I wish I could have eaten some cake in the end…</em></p>
<p id="line_292">They waited for everything to end while thinking to themselves. However, the end never came. Instead, what came was—</p>
<p id="line_293">“You seem to be in some trouble. I thought it would be tactless of me to intervene, but I will leave that matter to you.”</p>
<p id="line_294">Kumara, who had transformed herself into a beautiful woman, stood before Oria as if to protect Fran and Kizona.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_295">Thus, the battle between Kumara and Oria began, and once again, it was a one-sided affair. But this time, it was Oria who was completely outmatched.</p>
<p id="line_296">“There’s no way, why?!”</p>
<p id="line_297">A startled cry escaped Oria’s mouth. Oria’s Ultimate Enchantment, ‘Multiple Weapons,’ was the power to create <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> weapons of any performance. The full-body armor she wore was also <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, as it should be. And yet, the nine-tailed punches that Kumara was unleashing by manipulating her tails were damaging Oria without any regard to her <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> armor. It did not shatter the armor, but the impact still penetrated and reduced Oria’s physical strength.</p>
<p id="line_298">“You’re pretty weak, aren’t you? If that’s the case, I don’t need to send out the Eight Legions.”</p>
<p id="line_299">Kumara had wondered if she should send out a Tailed Beast to gauge the enemy’s strength, but after one battle, she had decided that there was no need. Oria was a top-notch warrior and a formidable opponent who could even control advanced magic. However, her movements did not deviate from the realm of human beings, and she did not stray from Kumara’s expectations in any way.</p>
<p id="line_300">For Kumara, who had experience with strong opponents such as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Frey, this opponent was unsatisfactory. It was Oria’s armament that should be of concern, but that too was not a threat to Kumara. Because Kumara had evolved even further. From a Nine Tails to a fox djinn. Kumara’s power had increased greatly once she took on divinity.</p>
<p id="line_301">Of course, Oria had a seraph in her, so she also had divinity. Moreover, when comparing the existence values between them, there was not much of a difference. Kumara had grown a little, but still had an existence value of less than 2 million, while Oria had an existence value of a little more than 2 million. By numerical values alone, Oria had the advantage. And yet—</p>
<p id="line_302">Oria, with only her experience as a human, had too narrow of a range of uses for her power. When they were humans, Oria—Orca and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Aria" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—had been the most senior executive members of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mixed Corps" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. They had been as strong as the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Imperial Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, the most powerful group in the Empire. The souls of these two women mingled and awakened as undead elves, and even gained the power of the seraphim. On top of that, the Ultimate Enchantment ‘Alternative,’ given to them by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, had been transformed into ‘Multiple Weapons.’ She was convinced that there were no enemies worth noting on earth.</p>
<p id="line_303">After experimenting with Fran and Kizona to confirm this, Oria was convinced that her power was the strongest. The weapons created by her skill were second to none for any existing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> equipment. As proof of this, Fran’s and Kizona’s attacks had not worked on Oria at all. They couldn’t even touch her body, and the two had been repelled by her <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> armor. Her weapon could shatter the enemy’s weapon with only a light swing. Oria had become overconfident in her own power. That was why she refused to acknowledge the current reality.</p>
<p id="line_304">“Do not take me for a fool! I’ll be getting serious from here on!”</p>
<p id="line_305">Now that the experimenting was over, Oria swung her ‘Trident’ around with all the skill she possessed. The magic that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Aria" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had been so good at transformed into a purple light. Even Kumara would have been mortally wounded if she were to be hit by the spear that Orca was unleashing with her brilliant skill. However…</p>
<p id="line_306">Nine tails, cloaked in a divine aura, moved freely to block the ‘Trident.’ At this point, the difference in ability was obvious to everyone. Just as it was natural for people to differ in power even when they had the same physical abilities, there was a difference between those who had studied martial arts and those who were still amateurs—perhaps even greater than that.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_307">Even Fran and Kizona, who had only been watching the fight between the two women, could clearly see the difference.</p>
<p id="line_308">“Wow, that’s amazing…”</p>
<p id="line_309">“Hey, is that person one of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s subordinates?”</p>
<p id="line_310">“I don’t know, but I’m pretty sure she’s on our side.”</p>
<p id="line_311">“How should I put this… I think I’ve come to realize that we should never become enemies. I mean, even the people we don’t know about are so powerful…”</p>
<p id="line_312">“Shut up. I agree with you even if you don’t say it.”</p>
<p id="line_313">They were admiring Kumara’s brave figure while talking about her. Kumara, the bewitching beauty herself, was standing gracefully without moving an inch. Once one realized this fact, it was like being shown that there was not any point in arguing about who was better.</p>
<p id="line_314">“Well, are you ready?”</p>
<p id="line_315">Kumara asked, her smile deepening.</p>
<p id="line_316">“I won’t accept this. That’s right, I won’t. I—we have acquired the strongest power. This power exists only to serve the great <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama!”</p>
<p id="line_317">“Hmm, I see. But it won’t work on me.”</p>
<p id="line_318">Kumara ruthlessly replied to the angry Oria. It was an obvious fact, but it was still enough of an insult to make Oria angry.</p>
<p id="line_319">“Don’t be silly! I am Oria, the one who defeats <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s enemies!!”</p>
<p id="line_320">Oria took pride in herself and attacked Kumara with all her might. But that was just reckless. A suicide attack without a plan was nothing but a meaningless attack to Kumara. Oria’s spear was flicked away by Kumara’s tail, and her limbs were restrained by four tails. The dull sound of shattering joints echoed through the air—A merciless ending for Oria.</p>
<p id="line_321">“My ‘name’ is Kumara. Kumara the ‘Chimera Lord.’ Receive this as a souvenir for the dead.”</p>
<p id="line_322">Kumara finally announced her name as she slammed her tails into the immobilized Oria.</p>

He had grown in strength and power beyond what he could have ever imagined as a human. That’s why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had put off killing them. The two inferiors were just the right playmates for him to test his strength on.</p>
<p id="line_324">Both Oria and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> knew that it was not an honorable thing for the strong to bully the weak. Unlike Vega, both of them had common sense and would not normally get involved in personal affairs in the middle of a mission. But this time, the situation was different.</p>
<p id="line_325">They both believed that if they didn’t test out their powers, which was very different from what they were used to, it would be a hindrance to their future battles. It was also a necessary task for a first-class warrior to grasp what they could do and to what extent they could push themselves. Therefore, he had taken this opportunity to allow himself a certain amount of play. Oxian and Kahn were aware of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ intentions. It was humiliating for the two proud men, but this time it was convenient.</p>
<p id="line_326">The victory condition was to buy time, and it was difficult for them to achieve that with their abilities alone. So, even though they knew they were being toyed with, they had no choice but to face <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> desperately. Aside from the intelligent Oxian, the old <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Kahn, was boiling like magma on the inside.</p>
<p id="line_327"><em>I’ll kill him. I’ll never forgive him!!</em></p>
<p id="line_328">Kahn was the leader of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mizeri" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s subordinates and was normally a calm and collected person. However, his patience was not as strong as Misora’s. He was always in awe of his colleagues, wondering how they could endure under someone like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raine" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. So now, after being humiliated like this, Kahn’s fury was at an all-time high. However, there was still a cruel wall between him and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_329">It was not so much a difference in skill-level. In fact, Oxian and Kahn were probably better than him in that aspect. But even so, the reason why it was so one-sided was that there was a large gap between their existence values by several times. Moreover, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> possessed the fearsome ‘Punishment King Sandalphon.’ Aside from a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> weapon, nothing could even compete with the ultimate skill. It had been a long and painful time, but that was coming to an end.

<p id="line_330">“Heh, that’s enough. You guys were pretty strong, right? Well, I’ve had a lot of fun, so I’ll kill you easily without causing you any more pain.”</p>
<p id="line_331">Having tested his strength enough, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> must have decided that it was time to stop fooling around. He told Kahn and Oxian as such. There was nothing they could do about it, Oxian had decided. <em>I will have to leave the rest to Leon-sama.

<p id="line_332">Oxian apologized inwardly. Kahn, too, etched anger into his soul.</p>

As long as the core was left intact, they could be revived over time. Depending on the amount of damage, it might take hundreds of years or more, but no matter what, they could always be revived. That is why Kahn swore to take revenge. Incidentally, it was necessary to interfere with the spirit in order to damage the mind.

<p id="line_371">But this time, I had not been prepared enough.

<p id="line_376">Hmm, as expected, he didn’t take this kind of gossip lying down. But that was the main purpose, wasn’t it?

I didn’t miss the look of disgust on his face. This was the secret technique, ‘leave it to someone else!’</p>
<p id="line_383">However, it worked so well this time that I was planning to force it on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> even if he didn’t like it. Well, reading the atmosphere and observing other peoples’ reactions are essential skills for working people. If you watch people carefully, you will eventually learn what makes them happy and what makes them uncomfortable. On top of that experience, I had previously worked for over ten years in the construction industry, where socializing was very important, and I was very good at harassing people like this. It was obvious from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s behavior that he had a problem with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I thought that I might be mistaken, but I was relieved to see that I was correct.</p>
<p id="line_384">“You really are a jerk, you bastard.”</p>
<p id="line_385">“I am honored by your praise.”</p>
<p id="line_386">“—Damn it, you really are getting carried away. Jahil, Leon, we’re leaving.”</p>

A victory in spirit—that was a joke, but this was, in fact, a tactical victory.</p>
<p id="line_388">“Hmm. Wouldn’t it be better to settle this here?”</p>
<p id="line_389">“Ah. It’s a command from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_390">“—Well, that’s fine. I owe you a debt of gratitude. My body doesn’t seem to be in the best of shape, so I’ll just do as I’m told.”</p>
<p id="line_391">Jahil had overwhelmed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but he grudgingly agreed. To be perfectly honest, I thought it would be troublesome if he had insisted on continuing, so I felt relieved. Or at least I did—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> then started to agitate Jahil.</p>
<p id="line_392">“Huh, are you running away? I almost had the chance to win, but it was my inexperience that stopped me from finishing you off. I’ll win next time though, you can be sure of that.”</p>
<p id="line_393">I wondered what in the world he was doing, but I couldn’t complain, since I was the one who started this in the first place.</p>
<p id="line_394"><em>What the hell is wrong with you guys?,</em> that’s what Silvia-san’s painful glare seemed to say.</p>
<p id="line_395">I could understand that feeling. From a third person’s point of view, I would have thought that we were idiots, too…</p>
<p id="line_396">“You don’t know your place in the world, you worm!! If you continue to taunt me, the Great Magician, then I—”</p>
<p id="line_397">“Jahil, that’s the slime’s right-hand man. If you lose your composure, then you’ll lose a battle you should be able to win.”</p>
<p id="line_398">Thank you for that misunderstanding! I think he misunderstood by a spoonful or two<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="A Japanese idiomatic phrase was used here.

It was probably due to my usual demeanor, but I think I was successful in making him more cautious than necessary.</p>
<p id="line_399">“Hmm…that’s true. I’ll allow this bastard to save face this time. There won’t be a next time, you brats.”</p>
<p id="line_400">Jahil seemed short-tempered, but he was surprisingly thoughtful. He had been all ready to go on another rampage, but he followed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s lead. And Leon, being manipulated as he was, did not argue. Having reached a consensus, the three of them flew away from the broken ceiling and into the sky.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_401">After seeing them off, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I sat down on the spot, our strength gone. I personally thought that it was better to be aggressive in a fight, but this time I had gone too far. I would have to be more careful next time, or it might have the opposite effect. Just as I was thinking about this, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> turned to me, exhausted and complaining.</p>

<p id="line_403">It was full of pent-up emotions that should have been said earlier.</p>
<p id="line_404">“You have no right to say that! We were just about to settle things, but then you goaded Jahil, and I was left wondering what was going on!”</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_407">Vega, who escaped from Ranga, did not think that he had lost. Vega’s fault was that he never reflected on himself, but his positive attitude was still something to learn from. Vega arrived at the battlefield where Kumara and Oria were fighting. He hid his presence and observed the situation. The conclusion of the battle came quickly. Oria had been fatally damaged by Kumara’s tail barrage. Fortunately for Vega, she was blown to the vicinity of where he was hiding.</p>
<p id="line_408"><em>How lucky. It’s as if the heavens are telling me to eat this thing!</em></p>
<p id="line_409">Vega thought selfishly. He had no sense of camaraderie, so there was no honorable moral that urged him to help others. This was especially true if the person in need was worthless. Vega licked his lips and crept closer to Oria.</p>
<p id="line_410">“Hey, you look good.”</p>
<p id="line_411">“Ve-Vega? Thank goodness, that person is stronger than I expected.”</p>
<p id="line_412">“Looks like it. But don’t worry. I’ll take care of the rest and avenge you.”</p>
<p id="line_413">Oria wondered if Vega had a soft side, but she was mistaken, and was forced to realize it by the intense pain she felt immediately afterwards. Vega’s gentle touch burned Oria’s skin. He then began to erode and eat Oria.</p>
<p id="line_414">“Gah, wh-what are you—”</p>
<p id="line_415">“I’ll eat your soul, so give me that Skill of yours, too. That right, with that, I’ll be able to take out those small fry bastards easily.”</p>
<p id="line_416">“No way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama will never forgive you—”</p>
<p id="line_417">“Shut up! This is a world of survival of the fittest, right? I’m sure that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> bastard would be more than happy to see me get stronger!”</p>
<p id="line_418">Vega shouted as such, laughing vulgarly. He then accelerated the erosion, without showing any mercy to the suffering Oria. It eventually reached her neck as he ate Oria to death with a sickening crunch.</p>
<p id="line_419">“Just what you’d expect from the work of a brute…how very ugly.”</p>
<p id="line_420">“To me, that’s a compliment.”</p>
<p id="line_421">In fact, even if eating Oria and her comrades was considered an atrocious act of cruelty to others, for Vega, it was merely a natural means to sustain his life. He followed his instincts and utilized the Ultimate Skill ‘Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka.’ As a result, Oria was completely decomposed by ‘Organic Domination’ and became Vega’s flesh and blood.</p>
<p id="line_422">“Wonderful, how wonderful! This power, I can feel myself getting stronger and stronger!”</p>
<p id="line_423">Vega was ecstatic and tested out the power he had inherited from Oria. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> armor covering his entire body, which had been recreated by ‘Metal Manipulation’ of the Blue Dragon Spear he had taken in, glowed in the color of blood. Even his hands, feet, elbows, and knees, were armed like the fangs and claws of a beast. It was at this moment that Vega’s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> form evolved into something even more hideous.</p>
<p id="line_424">Kumara, who had witnessed such a Vega, was highly alert from the start. The reason why she had thrown Oria out of the fight without finishing her off was because she had lost control when she sensed his persistent gaze. To a certain extent, Vega’s evil presence could not be concealed. As a result, Oria was dead, but Vega had been strengthened. He seemed to have been wounded when he first came here, so this could be considered a complete failure on Kumara’s part.</p>
<p id="line_425"><em>I’ve failed, haven’t I? What matters is not the quantity, but rather the quality of enemies. I cannot face <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama if I allow the enemy to grow stronger.</em></p>
<p id="line_426">Inwardly breaking out in a cold sweat, Kumara thought about how to recover. Having been defeated by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and then Frey, Kumara was not overconfident in her own abilities. It would have been best if she could have killed Vega here and now, but she knew that it was beyond her control. When one meets a strong opponent, it is necessary to assess their strength. If they failed to do so, the only thing that awaited them was defeat—In other words, death. Kumara sincerely understood that this was unacceptable. Now that she had been taken out of the deathless labyrinth, she could not make the mistake of getting herself killed.</p>
<p id="line_427">For that reason, although she felt ashamed for allowing Vega to grow stronger, she was able to avoid being dragged into a situation where she might have caused an even bigger mistake. One single decision could make all the difference. If Kumara had lost her temper and attacked Vega, she would have been beaten back and ‘Predation’ would have been the result. However, Kumara’s decision to wait and see allowed a third party to intervene in the situation.</p>
<p id="line_428">“We have been ordered to withdraw. Vega, the battle is over.”</p>
<p id="line_429">A figure suddenly appeared on the scene and stopped Vega, who had been ready to attack. That person was Mai Furuki, who had been standing idly by until then. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> ordered her to retrieve everyone, so she had used ‘Instantaneous Movement’ to arrive at Oria’s positional coordinates. However, Oria hadn’t been there, and she had stopped Vega’s outburst by chance. Vega obeyed quietly. He had just gained a great deal of power and instinctively understood that he would not be able to absorb any more food. Thus, Kumara’s crises ended, and the battle was over.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_430">Mai retrieved Vega and went to the place where <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was dying. His heart had been destroyed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was doomed to defeat. However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others who had become ‘Yōten’ would not die even without a heart. It was not blood that flowed through their veins, but rather mana, or divine power<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Can also be translated as spiritual power/energy" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>, that was the source of their strength. If they became skilled enough, they would be able to control the power at will. However, there was no doubt that being without a heart was a critical situation because it prevented them from exerting any great power. In the case of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the remnants of his human life had not yet been shed, and he was fatally weakened. If nothing was done, he would have been dealt a crushing blow and would have died.</p>
<p id="line_431">“Who are you?”</p>
<p id="line_432"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who had jumped back as soon as he sensed the presence, spoke to Mai. It was Vega who answered.</p>
<p id="line_433">“My name is Vega.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="It should be noted that Vega refers to himself as ‘Ore-sama’ which is a really arrogant/pompous way of doing so.

<p id="line_434">Upon hearing this, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wondered if his facade would slip away.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Actually, the translation was “Souei thought his expression would fall off,” but I changed it to make more sense in context." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> In all honesty, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was aware that he was prone to losing his temper. However, that was a demerit for a covert agent, so he had learned how to separate his head from his heart and turn his anger into energy. Normally, he would be angry, but would also smile coolly and then calmly torture his enemies. This time, however, it seemed to be difficult to do so, because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> understood at first glance that Vega had become abnormally strong.</p>
<p id="line_435"><em>This person is…one of the leaders of Cerberus, Vega of Power. What happened in this short period of time that he became so different from the previous findings?</em></p>
<p id="line_436">In this world, it was possible for one’s power to drastically increase to the extent that they became almost like a whole other person. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others’ Lord, had also experienced the aforementioned ‘super-enhancement’ such as with his <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> awakening and the True Dragon conversion. Therefore, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also had an understanding of such cases.

But that opportunity was lost. Mai did not want to waste time talking and had quickly withdrawn from the scene.</p>
<p id="line_437">“…That woman, appearing without any sign and disappearing without any warning…she may be a more troublesome opponent than Vega.”</p>
<p id="line_438"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> muttered to himself. Kahn nodded in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_439">“That was probably a form of ‘Instantaneous Movement.’ Whether it’s magic or a Skill, a preliminary step is required to cross through space.

Oxian came over and thanked him along with Kahn.</p>
<p id="line_441">“There is need to thank me.

Because the recovery potion was not working on her, Maetel-san, the leader of the White Knights who specialized in recovery, was currently taking care of her in the hospital room.

<p id="line_448">Well, I was worried about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but there was not much I could do about it.

He seemed to be holding a grudge against me for ignoring him on the battlefield, and I was positive he only had complaints, so I decided to use my ‘It-never-happened’ skill to the fullest and cover it up.</p>
<p id="line_452">“You bastard, how dare you ignore me that time!”</p>
<p id="line_453">“N-no, I didn’t! I have no idea what you mean by ignoring you.”</p>
<p id="line_454">“You were looking right at me!”</p>
<p id="line_455">“I-i didn’t notice you at all. More importantly, I’m just glad that everyone’s okay!”</p>
<p id="line_456">“Hey, don’t just change the subject. Besides, Leon’s been taken away, so there’s no way that everyone’s okay!”</p>
<p id="line_457">That’s true. But still, we had already taken that into account, right?</p>
<p id="line_458">“Now, now, things are still on schedule with Leon.”</p>
<p id="line_459">“You mean the plan that you were talking about before? I can’t help but think you’re just pushing off the problem, are really you sure about this?”</p>
<p id="line_460">“Maybe…”</p>
<p id="line_461"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> glared at me. Regarding Leon, I had actually thought of a plan beforehand. As <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san had suggested, using ‘Predation’ on Leon, and destroying the ‘control circuit’ itself, was a surefire countermeasure. The main reason I didn’t do that was not because I believed in Leon—rather, I didn’t like the idea, physiologically speaking. That was not a joke…but there were other reasons.</p>
<p id="line_462">The first reason was to avoid alarming <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. By leaving Leon here, I wanted <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to think that there was nothing we could do against him. The second reason was the ‘hope for the best’ strategy.</p>
<p id="line_463">“But you agreed when we discussed it, didn’t you? If Leon, who is under the enemy’s control, comes back to his senses after attacking, we can turn the power gap upside down.”</p>
<p id="line_464">“Well, yeah. I agree that it’s a reasonable plan, assuming that Leon is safe. If we can get to the point where Leon is attacking, that alone would give us an advantage.”</p>
<p id="line_465">That’s what I was thinking. He was right about me pushing off the problem, and there was still the question of whether or not I’d be able to conveniently get there, but if this went well, we could easily take out one of the enemies. Regardless of the number of troops, if we could replace Leon’s strength with our own, the battle would be as good as won. As soon as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san suggested that, I had made up my mind. In any case, the die had been cast. Now that Leon had been taken, I had no choice but to act with faith in the success of the mission.</p>
<p id="line_466">“Um, is Leon-sama going to be okay?”</p>
<p id="line_467">Alrose asked, and I gave him a big nod in response.</p>
<p id="line_468">“We have the means to free him, so don’t worry.”</p>
<p id="line_469">It would be bad if he was suddenly executed, but I didn’t think <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would do such a nonsensical thing.

Let’s trust His Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_471">Claude-san spoke and re-established the situation. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> still seemed dissatisfied, but this achieved my goal of diverting the conversation.</p>
<p id="line_472">“Never mind Leon, then. But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-kun, you definitely made eye contact with me back then, didn’t you?”</p>
<p id="line_473">Damn it, this guy…he just won’t let it go.</p>
<p id="line_474">“Um, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p id="line_475">“Don’t you dare play dumb with me! You bastard, I was having such a hard time dealing with Velzard, and you just ran away without even pretending to help me!”</p>
<p id="line_476">“I didn’t run away. I trusted you, you know!”</p>
<p id="line_477">“Hah? As always, you’re such a smooth talker. The point is, if you had just quickly come to the rescue, we wouldn’t have had to go through all that trouble!”</p>
<p id="line_478">Hold on, none of that was my fault.</p>
<p id="line_479">“Whoa, whoa, what are you saying when you’re the ones who didn’t contact us? We were on alert and responded as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p id="line_480">“Hah? Isn’t that what the magic transfer circle was for?!”</p>
<p id="line_481">“It didn’t activate! I mean, shouldn’t you have been able to make a call with this ring under any circumstances?”</p>
<p id="line_482">That’s right, I was told that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s Ring, which I had received upon becoming a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, would allow me to contact the others under all circumstances. And yet, neither <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nor Leon had contacted me.

I hoped that he would consider that a bit more.</p>
<p id="line_483">“Ah, that’s right. That ring was made by Velzard, so she could easily sabotage it. Sorry, I forgot about that.”</p>
<p id="line_484">Uh, well if he says that so openly, I can’t really say anything back…</p>
<p id="line_485">“Um, yeah. Well then, let’s just say that it was both of our faults this time.”</p>
<p id="line_486">“You’re right. It would be a problem if there was any conflict between us, so let’s stop fighting right now.”</p>
<p id="line_487">So that’s what we did. There were still a few things I wasn’t clear on, but honestly speaking, it was too much trouble to argue further. I would just be the adult this time. But enough of that.</p>
<p id="line_488">“So, why are these people sitting on the floor<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="To be more clear, they are being forced to sit in a seiza-style (which is like kneeling on the floor with a formal posture) like in a form of repentance." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>?”</p>

For some reason, they had been forced to sit on the floor the moment they were called into the room. Incidentally, Leon’s castle was made of stone, so the floor was completely covered with marble. It was difficult to sit upright even on tatami mats, so sitting upright on the floor in such a place seemed quite strenuous.</p>
<p id="line_490">“Oh, those guys. Do you want to hear about it?”</p>

<p id="line_510">It didn’t seem to be for a petty reason, such as it being the ‘second version.’ I’m also pretty good at reading the atmosphere, so I could tell that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was annoyed. I think Misora noticed it too, and when he said no, she quickly backed off. Knowing when to back off was a sign of competence. It made me think that Misora was a very capable person, unlike what I’d expect from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raine" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s subordinate.

It was both annoying and surprising because it was really useful information. She told us where the enemy’s base was, and about the forces that had been gathered. Although I was not sure how much of it could be trusted, she seemed to have gleaned quite a bit of useful information. Above all, the information she provided at the end was very important. Even I, who had just been listening to the conversation, turned to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raine" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_572">“—That’s how I got the information out of them!

<p id="line_573">Putting aside the fact that her true feelings were obvious, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raine" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s story was too important to ignore.

And yet, Pico and Gracia were not under control. Otherwise, it would be difficult to explain why they had been enjoying the girls’ party until the very end. This brought me to a conclusion. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s control might not be effective in ‘Isolation.’ This was very reliable information.</p>
<p id="line_574">Perhaps, whether it was through visibility or ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ the control was effective only when the object was recognized.

If he periodically issued orders via ‘Telepathy Net’ and checked whether the orders were carried out properly or not, he might not have such suspicions. However, if Leon was secretly released on the battlefield where <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was not present, it would be possible to decide the outcome of the battle before the enemy knew about it.

<p id="line_577">“Yeah. She’s a dumbass, and is useless during crucial times, but she also does things in ways I don’t expect. I hate to admit it, but that’s what she’s done this time.”</p>
<p id="line_578">I didn’t like to admit it either, but there are just some people in this world who are good at what they do. Even when they look like they’re fooling around, they still end up getting results. These were the so-called ‘genius’ types, and recognizing the work of these people would always be a test of ability to those who were in charge. Taking away the achievements of others would be a problem, but otherwise, they should be evaluated properly.</p>

<p id="line_580"><em>That’s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama for you,</em> I could practically hear the voice of her heart.

<p id="line_582">Even if she was saying that with such a firm expression, the moment was ruined because she was still sitting on the floor like that. That kind of thing was no good.

<p id="line_584">I couldn’t help but give her my sincere advice.

<p id="line_593">“<em>‘A child capable of many things’</em> is not a compliment, you know?”</p>
<p id="line_594">He spat out gravely.

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_598">Well, we went off on an unexpected tangent, but the discussion itself went smoothly. And so, I will summarize what we learned about the enemy situation. Vega, who was supposed to be one of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s friends, seems to have gained power and become much more powerful. Ranga intervened just as Misora and the others were in danger, and somehow managed to fight him off. However, Vega had eaten the enemy named Oria that Kumara defeated, and rapidly healed his injuries and improved his fighting ability.</p>
<p id="line_599">The exact numbers were unknown, but if we compare only the existence values, he seems to be stronger than both Ranga and Kumara. He apparently had a vulgar character, flattering to the strong and intimidating to the weak. However, he also seemed to have excellent survival instincts, having survived to this point and acquiring great power, despite all odds. My impression of him was that he would be a very troublesome opponent.</p>
<p id="line_600">Incidentally, Oria had apparently been able to create <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> equipment with her own Skill. Unlike <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Velgrynd" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Oria seems to have only materialized her weapons, but they hadn’t disappeared when she was eaten by Vega. This was the testimony of Fran and Kizona, the Knight Captains under Leon, and I also checked with Kumara, so I believed it to be correct.</p>
<p id="line_601">In other words, Vega must have inherited the ‘Weapon Creation’ Skill. This kind of problem was the type that became more dangerous if left unattended, so I thought that it would be better to deal with him as soon as possible. I, myself, am a similar type of person, so this was something I felt with a real sense of reality.</p>
<p id="line_602">The warrior whom <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> defeated by surprise was named <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Unfortunately, he had escaped before he could be finished off. It was a rare mistake for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but it seemed to be unavoidable after hearing his story. After all, there was a user of ‘Instantaneous Movement’ on the enemy side. Kahn also testified to this. It was not magic, but a Skill. The ability to jump through space without any preliminary movement was troublesome because it was difficult to measure the strength numerically. If she had mastered this Skill, we might be caught off guard. The fact that we had found out in advance that there was such a person on the enemy’s side was a big gain.</p>
<p id="line_603">The girl’s name was Mai Furuki, and it seems that we would have to rethink our strategy to take her skill into account. So far, those four people were the weakest of the enemies, but they still had given us a lot of trouble.</p>
<p id="line_604">Some of them, like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raine" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s drinking buddies Pico and Gracia, had been reluctant to follow, but it seems that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘Ultimate Dominion’ had turned them into our enemies. Well, I’m sure <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san would be able to something about it, but that would require a certain procedure. There was still the possibility that the control could be broken by one’s own will, so we would have to carefully assess the enemy. And then there were the serious enemies.</p>
<p id="line_605">Velzard, Zalario, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_619">“So, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_625">I see. So, he’s a solid opponent who is hard to upset. No matter the world, I guess it’s common knowledge that the strongest are those whose minds can remain undisturbed.

<p id="line_658">“No, not that. I’m saying, as much as I hate to admit it, that both of them can utilize the same powers.”</p>
<p id="line_659">“What?

I was hoping to be mistaken, but that was also why I definitely thought it to be the case.</p>
<p id="line_661">“It looks like they weren’t all taken over at the same time, so that’s fortuitous.”</p>
<p id="line_662">The fact that the effects of control did not occur at the same time was obvious from the fact that there was a time lag between Zalario’s domination and the domination over Leon and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. In addition, the extent of the influence of control was also limited. This was evidenced not only by the difference between the inside and outside of the castle, but also by the fact that Pico and Gracia, who had been in Isolation from the outside world with the igloo, were not taken over until later. Leaving aside the pros and cons of the ‘igloo,’ this information was valuable. That was because it confirmed that domination could not be achieved unless it was recognized by some means.</p>
<p id="line_663">“Ah. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raine" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others slacked off, but it was still a worthwhile achievement. It proves once and for all that you must be able to recognize your opponent in order to dominate them.”</p>

The reevaluation of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raine" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> certainly seemed to be a touchy subject. But, well, this allowed us to correctly evaluate the enemy.</p>
<p id="line_665">“Um, I can’t keep up with this conversation at all…”</p>
<p id="line_666">I briefly explained to Silvia-san, who raised her hand in a reserved manner. El-tan was terrifyingly sharp, but Silvia-san didn’t seem to be the same way. Or perhaps I was comparing her to the wrong people. Leon’s knight captains didn’t seem to be able to follow our conversation either. To begin with, Leon’s subordinates were a different story. It didn’t matter how smart they were. In the first place, without an Ultimate Skill, it would be impossible for one to understand this conversation.</p>
<p id="line_667">As one could see from the fact that El-tan had founded a country as the celestial emperor, it meant that Silvia-san’s daughter had a certain savvy over her. In fact, while Silvia-san is said to be stronger than El-tan in terms of strength, El-tan is said to be more insightful and adaptable. It went without saying that El-tan had the political strength, so they were able to share their roles properly. And so, while explaining the situation to Silvia-san and others, I tried to sort out the situation in my own way.</p>
<p id="line_668">It was likely that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was duplicating his powers and giving them to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. So, in effect, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could not be defeated without breaking through the ‘Castle Guard.’ And because he could probably utilize not only the Ultimate Dominion but also the control system, it was impossible for anyone but an Ultimate Skill user to defeat him. In that case, the number of people who could take on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be limited.</p>
<p id="line_669">“Well, it’s not all bad.”</p>

Moreover, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Velgrynd" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> told me that the ability is fueled by loyalty to the master.

<p id="line_672">Killing innocent people in the Empire was honestly too much for me. Well, actually, if that was really the only way, I guess I had to accept that the happiness of the many would come from the sacrifice of the few… I thought I was prepared to do it, but I wasn’t completely sure if I would. I think I may have just been bluffing with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but I didn’t think I could have actually done it.</p>
<p id="line_673">The Phantoms are invaders, so they must be prepared to die. Therefore, it would be polite for me to resist with all my might, and my conscience would not be hurt.

<p id="line_675">I even got some friendly advice from him, but I thought that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was surprisingly lenient to his people.</p>

However, Silvia-san objected to this.</p>
<p id="line_693">“No, no, that can’t be right, can it? He admitted that he and I are colleagues. He was the first highborn brother of the Divine Ancestor, and I was the third.

I wanted to tell him to shove it, but I was a sucker for things that would last.

Another person, Silvia-san, was also present, and the secret late-night meeting proceeded quietly. What would we do with this country now that Leon was gone? That was the content of this secret discussion.</p>
<p id="line_705">Since we had been able to ascertain the enemy’s strength during the daytime meeting, we were now reconfirming our future plan. The damage to the town was not too bad, but Leon’s castle was badly damaged, and there were people who had nowhere to go. It was a problem that there was no place to receive the refugees. The general consensus of the knight captains was to stay in the country and rebuild the town and castle, but if the Aggressors were to target this place, it would be difficult to deal with it. They would not be able to stop them from overrunning the place because they did not have enough forces to fight them. Now that Leon was gone, the probability of this place being targeted was low, but even so, I didn’t think we should do nothing about it.</p>
<p id="line_706">“If they’re going to stay, why don’t we just let them do what they want?”</p>
<p id="line_707">That was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s opinion. I’m the one who was against it because it was dangerous.</p>
<p id="line_708">“But you know, there’s no point in just talking about ideals, right? You can ask El-chan, but I don’t think <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> will accept them, either.”</p>
<p id="line_709">The total population of Leon’s country was less than 20 million. It would be impossible to prepare enough food to feed such a large number of people. Well, they could endure for a few days, but if they didn’t know for how long, there was nothing they could do. The people of the Golden Land El Dorado would be psychologically disheartened if they were to be sheltered without working. To be away from one’s work for a long period of time was enough to make one feel uneasy. The idea of evacuating to another country was unrealistic, as was pointed out earlier. On the other hand, having someone stay behind to guard them was also…</p>
<p id="line_710">“By the way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you won’t be staying here, right?”</p>

<p id="line_712">“I guess it’s no good. As I thou—eh?”</p>
<p id="line_713">“What, it’s not like we have a choice. This place is of little importance anyway, but even so, there’s always the possibility that they’ll take it out on them.”</p>

<p id="line_726">“So, is there something you wanted to talk about?”</p>
<p id="line_727">It was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who asked directly.

<p id="line_728">“I just thought I’d tell you everything I know.”</p>
<p id="line_729">Looking at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s refreshed expression, I thought to myself. This is going to be a long story. Although I had listened roughly to the discussion during the day, I felt that what I was about to hear would include <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s private life. So, I wanted to first ask for confirmation.</p>
<p id="line_730">“Are you sure it’s okay for us to hear about this?”</p>
<p id="line_731">“Yes. I am grateful to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono, so if you don’t mind, I would love to do so.”</p>
<p id="line_732">If she was putting it that way, then there was no reason to refuse. We listened to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s story in silence.</p>
<p id="line_733">………</p>
<p id="line_734">……</p>
<p id="line_735">…</p>
<p id="line_736">It was a personal story. It summed up <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s long life as a princess of a great nation. The guilt she felt towards Milim, the fear she felt towards <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Her resentment towards Leon and its sublimation. Listening to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s story, I almost felt guilty for having killed Clayman. After all, the Clayman in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s story was a kind and caring man. I could tell from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s tone of voice that he was loved by his friends. However, he had been distorted by his role as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and in the end, he was used by Lieutenant <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kondou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. As a result, he became the cause of many misfortunes, and was abandoned by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, particularly <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And I was the one who had killed Clayman.</p>
<p id="line_737">“About Clayman, well…”</p>
<p id="line_738">“Oh, there is no need to apologize. It was I who devised the plan, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono was just better than I was. After all, this is a world of survival of the fittest, and there is no need to show mercy to the loser.”</p>
<p id="line_739">That was also true. In the first place, Clayman had been completely evil from our point of view, and if I hadn’t eliminated him, we would have suffered a great deal. Even if you say that there was another side to him, it can only be said to be true. However, there were some things that I should think about regarding the fact that he was probably being manipulated, and I might have even developed some sympathy for him in an unorthodox way. That’s why I decided to tell <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> something that I had been holding back, wondering whether I should tell her or not.</p>
<p id="line_740">“Actually, I wanted to talk to you about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—”</p>

But now that we have an agreement, we were no longer enemies. It was natural for us to help her as an ally, if not as a friend. That’s why I rescued <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> when she was about to be killed by Jahil, but she had been seriously injured while protecting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. She was still resting in her hospital room, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was helping her.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_743">When I was asked this question, I agreed to do so. Looking back on it, I had swallowed Clayman’s end whole. I thought I had absorbed all of him as energy, but it seems that the residue had been placed in ‘Isolation.’ I didn’t want to leave such a thing behind, and I thought Clayman would be happier to return to his friends rather than to remain in my body. Perhaps, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san could have revived Clayman completely.

<p id="line_758">Ah, Silvia-san seems to have taken a liking to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has a tendency to give respect to those who don’t fear him. This seemed like a nice start to a good relationship for the future. In any case, I thought I had gotten away from the subject, but that was not the case.</p>
<p id="line_759">“So, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_761">“No, no, it just sort of happened, you know? It really was just a coincidence when I was saving them from Jahil’s attack—”</p>
<p id="line_762">I just let it slip out of my mouth. It’s a little sad that I had gotten used to this, but telling the truth was out of the question. I had no intention of revealing my abilities, and if the situation arose, I intended to keep silent.</p>
<p id="line_763">“That’s suspicious…are you hiding something?”</p>
<p id="line_764">“Talk to him more. He always keeps his mouth shut about the important things.”</p>
<p id="line_765">“Sh-Shut up, you guys! There’s a lot of things I don’t understand, and I don’t know why it happened this time either!”</p>
<p id="line_766">Actually, it was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san who did it, right? I don’t know anything about it. So, I don’t want others to get involved in it either…</p>
<p id="line_767">Rather, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Silvia-san had never met before, yet somehow, they were in perfect harmony. Today was the first time we had met too, but Silvia-san looked just like El-tan, so it didn’t feel like it was the first time. And so, unexpectedly, the late-night secret meeting became friendly and lively. Following the flow of the conversation, Silvia-san broke the ice.</p>
<p id="line_768">“By the way. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, I wasn’t sure if I should ask this, but I was wondering if you could tell me about your friends?”</p>
<p id="line_769">There was no mockery in her manner, but rather an air of determination.</p>
<p id="line_770">“Eh?”</p>
<p id="line_771"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who responded, was also puzzled to see Silvia-san like that. But then, as if remembering something, she opened her mouth.</p>
<p id="line_772">“I have an idea of what you want to ask me, so it’s fine. Also, you don’t have to address me with ‘san,’ so you can just drop the honorifics.”</p>
<p id="line_773">“Thank you. Then you can call me Silvia as well. Now, I know it may seem sudden, but—”</p>
<p id="line_774">“It’s about Laplace, right?”</p>
<p id="line_775">“Yeah. You heard about it?”</p>
<p id="line_776">“Yes. Laplace was reacting to your voice when you called him <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>…if the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> from the Sorcerer’s Dynasty is Laplace’s real name, then I’ve got a hell of a person on my side…”</p>
<p id="line_777">Their conversation continued. I had no idea what they were talking about, but they seemed to be talking about Laplace’s true identity.</p>
<p id="line_778">—Or rather…</p>
<p id="line_779">“Eh? Laplace is an ex-Chosen <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?!”</p>
<p id="line_780">“Yes, that’s right. And by the way, he’s my husband, and El-chan’s papa.”</p>
<p id="line_781">“…Seriously?”</p>
<p id="line_782">“Dead serious.”</p>
<p id="line_783">I looked at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in astonishment, and she nodded back calmly. She seemed to have already sorted things out in her mind. And the same could be said for Silvia-san, I guess. It must have been a long time ago, but she didn’t show any sign of resentment towards <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, even though she should have resented her more for the fact that her husband, who she thought was dead, had been turned into an <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="undead elf" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_784">“I’m sorry. I don’t blame you for hating me, but I’m still glad that I met Laplace.”</p>
<p id="line_785">“I’m happy to hear that, too. It makes me believe that he didn’t change his character even after he died. The way he defended you at the end made me realize that the man I loved is gone—”</p>
<p id="line_786">According to Silvia-san, Laplace could have escaped if he had wanted to. But he didn’t do so, perhaps because he was proud to be a member of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Moderate Clown Troupe" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Well, there was no way of knowing the truth now…</p>
<p id="line_787">“Well, that’s not necessarily true.”</p>
<p id="line_788">I didn’t mean to comfort her, but those words came out of my mouth. It was selfish of me, but I couldn’t give up hope. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san had told me that the chances of them being alive were not zero. That’s why I decided to believe that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Laplace were still alive. In the first place, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had always given me a lot of trouble, but as he was also Japanese, and a disciple of Shizu-san, I expected to be more shocked at his death. The reason why I did not feel sad was because I suspected that his death was a lie. No, it’s true that he had disappeared right before my eyes without a trace, but I couldn’t trust him. Because I had been deceived by him many times. That’s why he’s alive. As long as I thought that, there was no need to be sad.</p>
<p id="line_789">“You’re right. The boss is really stubborn.”</p>
<p id="line_790">“Yeah. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has been alive all this time and hasn’t even contacted me, so he really is a no-good person. He just reincarnated as an <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="undead elf" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and lost his memory, leaving me alone. It’s no use worrying about such a no-good guy, so I’ll change my mindset!”</p>
<p id="line_791">Apparently, my words were not in vain. I was worried that my words might have been inappropriate, but if I could lighten <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s and Silvia-san’s feelings even a little, then I had done a good job. And so, the late-night conversations continued. Overcoming today’s sorrows to win tomorrow’s battles.</p>

<p id="line_796">“What? I didn’t have a problem—”</p>
<p id="line_797">“That’s probably why. These powers are one at their core. Since you’ve set your loyalists as phantoms, I’m guessing that there’s no one who knows about me.”</p>

<p id="line_800">The two reported each other’s situation as if they were having a casual conversation.

<p id="line_822">Normally, a commander would need to have a tactical mindset, but on a battlefield where individual strength was important, strength was all that mattered. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s idea was that as long as the hierarchy was set, the rest could be left to the discretion of the commander. This was completely wrong, but it had worked so far. So, without any hesitation, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> set the hierarchy of strength. The strongest, along with himself, was the old friend who was not here. He was followed by Zalario and Jahil. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> decided to appoint these three as the new Three Phantom Commanders.</p>
<p id="line_823">“First of all, we will establish the new Three Star Commanders<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Same kanji as Three Phantom Commanders except the ‘phantom’ part was replaced with the character ‘Hoshi 星’ meaning star.

As generals of Veldanava-sama, I want you to exert your power to the fullest.”</p>
<p id="line_824">The reason for the name change was that there were two people other than the phantoms. The star, of course, referred to the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Star King Dragon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ It was a title intended for one to serve as a general with the purpose of reviving Veldanava.</p>

<p id="line_826">As soon as he announced this, there was a murmur of discontent. It was Vega.</p>
<p id="line_827">“Hey now, you’re appointing some random bastard to be a supreme general of the Heavenly Army instead of me? That doesn’t make any sense!”</p>
<p id="line_828">This time, Vega, empowered by eating Oria, was getting carried away again. He was a very unfortunate man who appeared to have lost the concept of remorse.

Anyone who was not useful would be discarded.

Next time, if Vega disobeyed him, he would seriously dispose of him. Vega, with his superior survival instincts, could sense this. The Vega who had been feeling all-powerful after his growth, found <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s strength to be on a different level.

<p id="line_831">“Damn, I’m sorry. I wanted you to think more highly of me, so I interrupted you…”</p>
<p id="line_832">He made up for the mistake and pushed down his dissatisfaction.

Originally, he had planned to appoint <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as part of the ‘Seven Angels,’ and Vega was going to be included as one of the ‘Four Star Commanders.’</p>
<p id="line_835">Mai and Oria were going to be assigned as auxiliaries, to serve as support. Unfortunately, from the very beginning, the plan had been drastically modified. In any case, he decided to assign Zalario, Jahil, and one more person, as the Three Star Commanders. The ‘Seven Angels’ consisted of Leon, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Pico, Gracia, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Mai Furuki, with Vega at the top.</p>

<p id="line_839">Only four spots remained.

<p id="line_843">It was Leon who asked that question. The one who nodded in agreement was the third member of the Three Star Commanders. He was a slender man with an exceptionally large physique.</p>

<p id="line_845">The man was not <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. His long, shaggy hair was green. It was not the same as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s dull blue hair. His eyes shined like jade, which was also different from the blue-eyed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. However, they were vaguely similar in appearance.</p>
<p id="line_846">The man’s name was Fenn. He was the younger brother of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Continent’s Wrath" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ and was known as the Crazed Fists titan who had been sealed away by Veldanava during a rampage in ancient times. The first to react to the sight of Fenn was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who was normally laid-back.</p>
<p id="line_847">“It can’t be, you released the Gleipnir that was binding Fenn?! Even though <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has been so vigilant, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, what the hell are you thinking?!”</p>
<p id="line_848">And, quite unusually, he questioned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He was still surprised, and his tone had become rough.</p>
<p id="line_849">“Hmph, don’t worry. Fenn and I are friends. Our interests are aligned, and—”</p>
<p id="line_850"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> insisted that Fenn’s abilities were tremendous. Fenn’s magicules, which he was not trying to conceal, were leaking out as a supreme energy that overwhelmed the others. In terms of existence value, it exceeded sixty million, and was so vast that it could be said to rival the True Dragons. However, there were other people besides <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who were uncomfortable with Fenn.</p>
<p id="line_851">“Damn, an evil deity sealed away in ancient times. He’s the kind of tyrant that even I wouldn’t want to deal with, let alone the Divine Ancestor!”</p>
<p id="line_852">Jahil spat viciously. He did not know the man directly but had heard about him from the Divine Ancestor. According to him, he was an evil deity who had been sealed by Veldanava for his destructive acts. In Jahil’s mind, he was the second most evil incarnation after the ‘World-destroying Dragon’ Ivarage. That legend was now standing in front of him. Faced with this fact, Jahil was disgusted to the point of nausea. But Fenn didn’t care. Smiling, he put his arm around Jahil’s shoulders and whispered in his ear.</p>
<p id="line_853">“Hey now, we’re all friends, right? Let’s get along. I heard about it. Like you, I was appointed as one of the Three Star Commanders. Unlike the rest of those small fry, you’ve got something to offer. You’re more than qualified to be my servant<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="This word, ‘Teshita (手下),’ can also mean ‘minion’ or ‘underling.’" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>.”</p>
<p id="line_854">It was a statement that completely disrespected Jahil. Jahil shuddered in humiliation. For Jahil, who believed that he deserved to reign as the emperor, it was unthinkable to be looked down upon. But he could not complain. He could feel the desperate pressure of the arm around his shoulder. A cold sweat broke out on Jahil’s forehead, and he sat back in his chair.</p>
<p id="line_855">“Hmph! I forgive you for now. I don’t intend to end up like this either, but I’ll leave things alone for now.”</p>
<p id="line_856">And with that, he agreed to work for Fenn. Now that that was out of the way, they were wondering about the reaction of the remaining Zalario, but he didn’t seem to have any intention of fighting in the first place. This was not just because he was under the control of the Ultimate Dominion, but also because Zalario, as a warrior, understood his own strength. Whether he could win or not could only be seen in actual combat. However, an all-out battle would cause enormous damage to both sides and would undoubtedly affect the future of the war. It would be pointless, to say the least. That is why Zalario decided to end the situation by giving in himself. Thus, Fenn was appointed as the leader of the Three Star Commanders.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_857">With all the actors in place, all eyes turned once again to the miniature Cardinal World.</p>
<p id="line_858">“So, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. What do you mean that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s not a problem? I understand that Fenn-dono has joined our ranks, but that’s not the end of the matter.”</p>
<p id="line_859">Fenn replied to Jahil with a smirk.</p>
<p id="line_860">“Hey now, that’s just sad. Are you underestimating my abilities? If you know me, then you should understand, right? <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is certainly my big brother, but I’m more powerful than him.”</p>
<p id="line_861">Jahil replied bitterly to Fenn.</p>
<p id="line_862">“I don’t need that kind of boasting. If you really have no problem with it, just show me the results.”</p>
<p id="line_863">Jahil was arrogant. Even though he recognized Fenn’s ability, he did not intend to give up his pride as an emperor to follow him. Fenn seemed to like Jahil and smirked at him.</p>
<p id="line_864">“Even though you know me, you still have that attitude. That’s fine, I’ll live up to your expectations.”</p>
<p id="line_865">Fenn smiled happily. He hadn’t had a chance to talk to anyone ever since he had been sealed away in Veldanava so long ago. Despite this, scenes of the world had still been flowing into his mind as if he were dreaming. This was because he was connected to his brother, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and his other brother, deep in his soul. That is why he was aware of the world situation to a certain extent. He understood that they were at the verge of the beginning of the age of civil war, and that this was an environment where he could be violent.</p>
<p id="line_866"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the only one who had visited Fenn when he was sealed up. As for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he had only been taking care of Fenn because Veldanava entrusted him to do so. At some point, they became friends, exchanging small talk and consulting each other. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had no relatives to talk to because he was the leader. Fenn, too, had come to realize that solitude was lonely after being sealed for so long. In a sense, it was inevitable that they had come to trust each other. And now, Fenn had been given a place to play, and a friend to show off his power. There was no reason for Fenn not to be excited. It wasn’t not that Fenn was less violent than he used to be, it’s just that he had learned to value his friends more. Fenn was more than happy to have friends. That is why he was grateful to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> from the bottom of his heart.</p>

<p id="line_869">The Heaven’s Tower was the stairway to the Heavenly Star Palace. Those who did not have the key to open the main gates had no way to enter the Heavenly Star Palace except through the Heaven’s Tower.

It would be different if he were under a stronger control, but he could still say what he wanted.</p>
<p id="line_870">Incidentally, the same was also true for Leon. His actions were constrained, but his thoughts remained unchanged. That is why, even in the battle with Silvia, he was able to minimize the damage by not attacking extensively. In addition to that, he had also sent signals with his eyes, but unfortunately Silvia did not understand them. It was not because Silvia was not perceptive enough, but because she had been very busy. However, even if she had been able to understand the signals, the information would have been limited to <em>‘Leon still has free will,’</em> so it wouldn’t have been very meaningful anyway…</p>
<p id="line_871">In any case, at the moment, the Ultimate Dominion only restricted his actions, but still allowed him to think freely.

<p id="line_888">“Leon, please join them. In addition to Fenn, there will be four of the ‘Seven Angels’ attacking the Heaven’s Tower. I think that should be enough.”</p>
<p id="line_889">Thus, the members being dispatched to the next target had been decided.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_890">The meeting seemed to be ending, but instead of that, everyone moved on to the next topic.</p>

<p id="line_896">“The first thing I want you to remember is our purpose.”</p>
<p id="line_897">That was the answer. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wondered what the purpose was.

<p id="line_900"><em>Those who speak for the god are the most troublesome. They can distort your opinion without your permission when you openly state a different interpretation.

As for Jahil, it didn’t matter to him either way. If Fenn is active, he can just watch him, and if he is in danger, he can sell him a favor.

<p id="line_941">“Hmph! It’s a shame that they’re not the ones I trained, but it can’t be helped. As soon as I see Fenn’s victory, I’ll attack from the west to the center, do you mind?”</p>

She would’ve been a great help as a warrior, but what was most important to Silvia-san was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, where her daughter was. I couldn’t just force her to do anything I wanted, so we promised to cooperate with each other if anything happened. I also gave her a cell phone, just in case. El-tan had one, but I decided that it would be better for Silvia-san to have one as a backup. The communication function of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s Ring was not universal, and it was best to have as many means of communication as possible. After this trouble was all over, we could use them for fun. After exchanging our contact information, I saw Silvia-san off.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_965">And now, I was in my office. There was so much paperwork that I almost felt as if my daily life had returned to normal. Just by looking at them, my anger towards <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to increase by about 30 percent. Look, I wasn’t just playing around either. And yet, there were piles upon piles of proposals that needed my approval, and a mountain of meeting notes for various measures that were being taken.</p>
<p id="line_966">For the time being, I was putting off the meeting notes. I didn’t need to rush to look at them because they had already been done. I looked through the new projects that needed approval and quickly decided whether they were acceptable or not. I was busy, but it couldn’t be helped. After all, the day after tomorrow, the world conference would be held in Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_967">That’s right, a world conference. This would be the first such event in history. The participation of the Emperor of the Eastern Empire in the Western States Council, which was regularly held in the West, was an unprecedented event. Actually, I was supposed to meet up with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the Kingdom of Blumund and go with him. But then some idiot decided to invade Leon’s country, and that’s why our plans were thrown off. It was a mistake that I was now forced to fill in the gaps with these documents.</p>
<p id="line_968">But that was all over now. All I had to do now was to sip some tea and relax. I would try to calm down and collect my thoughts before the show.</p>
<p id="line_969">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, here’s your tea.”</p>
<p id="line_970">It was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, not <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who brought me the tea. He was working hard as a secretary, probably because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was away.</p>
<p id="line_971">“Thank you. You should take a break with me, too.”</p>
<p id="line_972">I said as such, encouraging <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to sit face-to-face. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was thrilled and looked at me to say something like, ‘I’m honored,’ but I ignored it and started talking.</p>
<p id="line_973">“So, what kind of guy is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, from your point of view?”</p>
<p id="line_974">From my point of view, he seemed to be surprisingly unpopular. If he wasn’t, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wouldn’t have betrayed him so easily. Anyway, what I needed now was information about the enemy. If you know what kind of character they have, you will be able to judge to what extent they can bluff or not in case of emergency. I understood well enough that he was cautious, so I thought I would ask if there was anything else. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought for a moment and then answered.</p>
<p id="line_975">“He’s a serious guy. He is hard-headed, inflexible, or whatever you wish to call it, but once he has made up his mind, he will not bend his will. He has a personality that doesn’t consider other people’s opinions even as a reference, so his peers were divided in their evaluation of him.”</p>
<p id="line_976">In other words, for a yes-man, he is an easy boss because they only have to do what they are ordered to do, and for a talented and creative person, he is an uninteresting boss who ignores their own opinions. It can be very stressful if your opinion is not accepted. If there is a good reason that is explained to you, you will be satisfied, but if there is just a rejection, you might be left with a grudge.</p>
<p id="line_977">“Is there anything else?”</p>
<p id="line_978">When I asked, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began to worry, muttering, “That’s right…”</p>
<p id="line_979">Then he responded with an “I’m not certain about this,” and went on to tell me something more important than I had expected.</p>
<p id="line_980">To put it simply, it was about how to get to and from their base and this world. They—the Aggressors, were the altered versions of those banished from this world by Veldanava and the angel legions that were their watchers. Their base, of course, was in the Otherworld. The connection between the Otherworld and this place, the Cardinal World, was a special force field called the ‘Underworld Gate,’ and there were several of them around the world. They were guarded, or rather controlled, by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Surprisingly, they were expanding their sphere of influence around the ‘Underworld Gate.’ The only one known to exist was the ‘Underworld Gate’ guarded by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, not too far from Leon’s territory. The other gates guarded by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ultima" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had disappeared due to a major battle.</p>
<p id="line_981">“We’re better off without them. If you go to the Otherworld with your body, it will be contaminated and transformed. Those who come here from the other side are almost certainly Aggressors.”</p>
<p id="line_982">He told me bitterly. In short, it would be easier to destroy the ‘gate’ itself, since it only brought chaos in this world. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ultima" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t approve of that. They had been guarding the gate for a long time, but when <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> went to scout for them, the gate was broken, so they had been easy to recruit. I thought to myself, <em>That can’t be true, right?</em> but I didn’t say it.</p>
<p id="line_983">As proof, the gate that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had guarded appeared to be broken. At present, it seemed that the gates had been left unattended because one could not come and go without great power. I secretly thought that the correct answer was that it was broken on purpose. But back to the main topic, what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was wondering about was how <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others had come to this world. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> speculated that perhaps a new ‘gate’ had appeared somewhere in the Empire.</p>
<p id="line_984">“Or maybe they’ve restored the gate that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> used to guard?”</p>
<p id="line_985">“I cannot deny that possibility. However, it doesn’t match the time when <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> appeared in the Empire, so it is certain that another ‘gate’ exists.”</p>
<p id="line_986">Well, that made sense.</p>
<p id="line_987">“So then, you’re assuming that the Aggressor’s base is inside the Empire, right?”</p>
<p id="line_988">So, I confirmed as such, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s concern was something else entirely.</p>
<p id="line_989">“No, that’s not all. From what I heard of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s story, there is no doubt that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has opened the gates to the Heavenly Star Palace. One would need a ‘key’ to open it—”</p>
<p id="line_990">The ‘Heavenly Star Palace,’ also known as the place of beginnings, and the birthplace of Veldanava, I believe. As <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had explained, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s base was adjacent to every world. In other words, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s concern was about how to get the key—</p>
<p id="line_991">“There is no point in worrying about how they got it. What matters is that if you pass through the gates of the Heavenly Star Palace, you can come to the Cardinal World with the body that exists in the Otherworld.”</p>
<p id="line_992">Oops, I’m glad that I didn’t put that into words because it was way off. Even so, what did he mean by the body that exists in the Otherworld?</p>
<p id="line_993">“Of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Angels, only <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was given a body by Veldanava-sama. The current one is only inhabiting a temporary body, so there is no point in killing it.”</p>
<p id="line_994">“Is this something like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Velgrynd" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘Parallel Existence’?”</p>
<p id="line_995">“No, it’s different from that. It’s not like they are connected all the time, but rather they’re splitting their consciousnesses. He’s probably synchronizing his memories periodically, so there are no inconveniences…”</p>
<p id="line_996">That’s why it was so troublesome, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> explained to me. From what I could understand, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Velgrynd" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was like a set of synchronized computers connected to the internet, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was like a set of computers disconnected from the internet, with only the data being transferred from the terminals.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_997">«That seems to be the correct understanding. In other words, ‘Spacetime Continuous Attack’ will not be able to reach the main body, so he is a very troublesome opponent.»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_998">I see, very troublesome.</p>
<p id="line_999">“So then, unless we go to the place where the main body is to defeat <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you can’t defeat him. It’s certainly troublesome…but, huh? If the main body is going to go out of its way, isn’t that convenient for us?”</p>
<p id="line_1000">Rather than searching for someone we don’t know where he is, it would save us a lot of trouble if he came to us. That’s what I thought, but it seems that it was not that simple. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> answered.</p>
<p id="line_1001">“Yes. However, he is simply quite strong.

That is why I wondered if we needed to be prepared for any eventuality.”</p>
<p id="line_1002">The body Veldanava had given him was a treasure to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

But we also had to consider the possibility of him reversing that belief. I think that was correct. The situation should not be turned upside down by a single idea from the other party. And even more so when it was a force that couldn’t be ignored.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_1010">Now that I understood how bad <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was, I was curious about the next target.</p>
<p id="line_1011">“How do you think he’ll make his move?”</p>
<p id="line_1012">“Hmm, that’s right…it’s hard to predict, but based on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s personality, I’d say he’s most likely planning to go after <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono.”</p>
<p id="line_1013">“Eh?”</p>
<p id="line_1014">The unexpected answer took me by surprise. But it was certainly an opinion I could not ignore. I thought there was no point in going after <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but then I reconsidered the possibility. Why was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> targeted in the first place? They had probably suspected that he was the reincarnation of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rudra" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and wanted to kill him. And this was proven by the fact that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Velgrynd" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> loves <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was probably more wary of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rudra" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> than <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The reason for this was unclear, but it was certainly not surprising that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be a target.</p>
<p id="line_1015">“In the first place, I don’t think the reason is important.

<p id="line_1017">“Then the next meeting might be dangerous. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Velgrynd" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san will be escorting him, so unless something goes wrong, I think we’ll be fine, but you should be on the lookout as well.”</p>
<p id="line_1018">“Please rest assured. I am always perfectly prepared for anything.”</p>
<p id="line_1019">That’s the kind of thing I can trust in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1027">Milim’s castle was under construction, but there were still some habitable parts that were already completed. There was also a medical facility in one such corner, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was lying in one of the rooms there. When she had first escaped to this place, she had been in a serious condition, to the point of unconsciousness, but now she was awake, and her upper body was upright on the bed. It seems that she had been asleep for a long time, and we hadn’t been able to hear what happened. Nodding my head, I greeted <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1028">“Hi, I’m <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Tempest.

<p id="line_1029">Since it was our first meeting, I started by introducing myself. Frey-san, who appeared to have grown more attractive, looked at me as if she was taken aback.</p>
<p id="line_1030">“It may be impolite to say this to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but don’t you think you should learn to show a little more dignity? It is one thing to be able to do your duty during an emergency, and another to be able to do so duty in your everyday life. The difference is obvious to anyone who sees you.”</p>
<p id="line_1031">I immediately received a complaint, but from Frey-san’s point of view, it was probably because she was worried about the negative influence on Milim. Because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was—because Milim was always making excuses. That was probably it. It was like a mother worrying about her bad friend. I couldn’t help but smile because it was so funny. Seeing me, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> smirked.</p>
<p id="line_1032">“Hey, it’s tough having Frey on your radar.”</p>
<p id="line_1033">Hey now, don’t say that just because you got a new ally. Both <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Frey-san, while they might say a lot of things, treated me casually when nobody else was watching. I had asked them to do so and was grateful to them because I didn’t have to be so formal that way. Even so, the atmosphere around the two of them had changed significantly. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had reported it to me, but now that I was seeing them in person, they were like different people.</p>
<p id="line_1034">“I heard about it, so you’ve taken full ownership of the power you’ve awakened?”</p>
<p id="line_1035">“Oh yeah. Tell <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that I owe him for his help the other day.”</p>
<p id="line_1036"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was good friends with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He liked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> when he picked a fight with him during their first meeting, and they had been friends ever since. Even though the power relationship between them was now reversed, the fact that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t mind at all, and even boasted that he would soon catch up to overtake him, proved how big of a person he was. The same was true of Frey-san.</p>
<p id="line_1037">“I’m grateful to you for that. Now I can be of more use to Milim than before.”</p>
<p id="line_1038">She smiled and thanked me, but that didn’t mean that it was easier to scold Milim now, did it? I suspected as much but accepted her words of gratitude as it went without saying that I would need her strength to survive the Great War.</p>
<p id="line_1039">“Even so, Ramiris’ labyrinth is a foul play. I never realized that there was such a use for it, even though we had been together as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s for such a long time.”</p>
<p id="line_1040">“That’s for sure. I thought she was just <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s favorite, but I’m surprised the little pipsqueak<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="He called her ‘chibisuke.’ It can also mean little runt, or midget/dwarf." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> had that kind of power hidden.”</p>
<p id="line_1041">“I’m sure she wasn’t hiding it. It’s just that no one noticed.”</p>
<p id="line_1042">“I knew about it!”</p>
<p id="line_1043">“Knowing about it is useless if you are unable to do anything with it. That labyrinth made me understand that. That’s why, Milim, don’t be a sore loser.”</p>
<p id="line_1044">The know-it-all Milim was being chided by Frey-san. Laughing at this, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> expressed his opinion.</p>
<p id="line_1045">“But well, I can’t laugh at Milim. We look like idiots too. But, hey, it makes sense, doesn’t it? When it comes to treating others well, no one can match <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_1046">“That’s right. In that sense, we are also the ones being used.”</p>
<p id="line_1047">Frey-san nodded, but I hadn’t expected that about Ramiris’ labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_1048">I initially thought I would just try and make use of it, and after asking, I couldn’t help going, <em>What? Is that really possible?!</em></p>
<p id="line_1049">I was surprised. And through trial and error, the current labyrinth was born. Since I had not envisioned it from the beginning, their opinion was an overestimation. But well, just by the results, the labyrinth really was amazing. The fact that you can come back to life even if you die in the labyrinth is a foul play, no matter how you look at it. The labyrinth was perfect for training, and from a defensive point of view, it was just too impregnable. It’s a wonder that Ramiris had been underestimated, and it felt like my own achievements were practically nonexistent. However, I felt that it was wrong to talk about it, so I just laughed and covered it up.</p>
<p id="line_1050">“Now then, let’s finish our greetings and get down to business, shall we?”</p>
<p id="line_1051">Frey-san’s words changed the atmosphere of the hospital room into a serious one. At this point, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who had been looking at us with a wide-eyed look<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The phrase was “with black and white eyes,” but that didn’t make much sense to me in English unless the author is saying that her eyes are literally black and white, but I have seen this expression being used in other places." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>, tightened her expression. Finally, she said a few words of greeting to me.</p>
<p id="line_1052">“Nice to meet you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I am <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of the former Three Phantom Commanders and head of the anti-cryptid forces.”</p>

She spoke with a mysterious look on her face, but there was no hint of a lie. Just as Milim and the others believed, my intuition was telling me that it was true. But just in case, I decided to poke my head in.</p>
<p id="line_1054">“Just for the record, you do understand that betrayal on the eve of a major war can lead to suspicion of espionage, right?”</p>
<p id="line_1055">“Of course. I have no way of proving my innocence, but I will tell you everything I know.”</p>
<p id="line_1056">The expression on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s face was sincere, without a single trace of cloudiness. She explained what had happened, even though she wasn’t in the best of shape yet. After she had finished her discussion with Milim, she returned to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others. It was good that she received a physical body there, but at the same time, she also acquired an angelic skill. Sensing that she could be in trouble, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> considered the possibility that she might be controlled by this power. She then discarded the Ultimate Skill ‘Salvation King Azrael’ that she had acquired before <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could take control of her.</p>
<p id="line_1057">Silvia-san taught me this technique of separating the mind from the Skill. I was impressed by her knowledge, but when I thought more about it, I wondered if her betrayal had been exposed because the enemy had sensed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s abandonment of her Skill.

I would just dismiss it as an unavoidable situation and pretend that I didn’t notice it.

Quite frankly, I found it credible.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1058">«I agree. The story was coherent, and she even talked about information that normally should have been hidden. If she’s willing to go this far, it’s not worth the price of espionage.»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1059">That’s right.

It was interesting to examine the information from the perspective of whether there would be any merit should it be false.

<p id="line_1065">“Huh, have you grown taller?”</p>
<p id="line_1066">I had grown a bit taller since I became a True Dragon. I used to be able to look <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the eye, but now we were back to the same height difference as before.</p>

<p id="line_1069">“Your hair too?”</p>
<p id="line_1070">“Yes, it’s completely discolored. I’ve gotten used to it, but it was a bit disconcerting at first.”</p>
<p id="line_1071">At this point, I wondered if it was some kind of anomaly.

I stopped worrying about it, and we went into the chamber together.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1072">In the large circular venue, which I had already visited several times before, the heavyweights from various countries had already arrived. It was noisy and bustling in its own way, but as soon as they saw us, it all went quiet.

<p id="line_1078">As befits a leading role, we were in the front row.

<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 19/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1079">The Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the Great Underground Maze. It was a secret passage that had been dug for over hundreds of years. It was a facility prepared in case of the invasion of angels and was widely known as a maze because of its intricate complexity. There were several large open areas in the levels near the surface which could be used by anyone as a place of refuge in case of emergency.</p>
<p id="line_1080">However, that was only on the surface. At the lower levels, there were secret places that only a few people knew about. It was the dark side of the Royal Capital, an evil research facility that could never be revealed to the world. The research there was controlled by magical inquisitors, and the content of their research was the method of incorporating the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> factor into the human body.</p>
<p id="line_1081">The results of their research were still quite impressive, including muscle strength ten times greater than that of normal humans, skin tougher than steel, and skeletons to support those muscles. The result was their own bodies, but the king’s judgment was that it was not enough to face the supernatural existence of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1082">“Another failure. This one’s a little more fragile than I thought.”</p>
<p id="line_1083">“Khihihihihi. If we want to incarnate a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, we have to make a stronger body. I heard that the Empire was developing a weapon called the Battle Chimera, and the concept is similar to ours.”</p>
<p id="line_1084">“Hmm. There’s a difference between modifying the human body directly and using it as a synthetic beast.”</p>
<p id="line_1085">The existence of a drug that could induce medical skills had been a closely guarded secret and was not widely known. Therefore, the researchers here believed that the Battle Chimera was the perfect weapon. However, they believed that strengthening the human body directly was quicker than using synthetic beasts, and that they were superior to them. That is why, without any sense of repulsion, they were repeating experiments that would seem forbidden to ordinary people.</p>
<p id="line_1086">But it was still not enough. They were not satisfied with the results. Currently, they had exhausted the factors of capturable <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and had succeeded in extracting some factors (essences). The reinforcement rate was steadily increasing, and the model was being upgraded, but this time the vulnerability was not a physical issue but rather a mental issue.</p>
<p id="line_1087">It is said that a sound mind resides in a sound body. If this is true, then a strong body should be accompanied by a strong mind. With this in mind, the researchers began to search for a way to fuse spiritual life forms. The quickest way to do so, they argued, would be to tap into the power of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The reason for this was that it was easy to obtain a body. In the north, there were repeated skirmishes with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="lesser demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="greater demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s were procured by capturing weaker ones. Such <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were lodged into dead bodies and incarnated. Thanks to these <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they had succeeded in analyzing their composition, and discovered some interesting results.</p>
<p id="line_1088">What is the mechanism of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> incarnation? The answer to this question was that the magicules eroded human cells and transformed them to be compatible with magic. However, this was only the case when the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> took the initiative, and forcibly taking in the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s power was nothing but a poison to the human body. That was a given. Energy intake through food, sleep, and even breathing would become unnecessary, and even life span would disappear. It would be like being reborn as a completely different life form, and to control that by human will would be the ultimate form of recklessness.</p>
<p id="line_1089">Besides, the magical inquisitors were mistaken. They focused only on strengthening the body, while the important thing was the power of the will. They thought that only the physical body should be trained, because the mental aspect was strengthened by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s power, and so the experiments were repeated in the wrong direction.</p>
<p id="line_1090">And one more thing. This misunderstanding was fatal. By cultivating the cells incarnated by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, a factor (essence) is extracted. They thought that by injecting it, the subject would also possess the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s power. This was a big mistake. A <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> took the incarnated body as its own with the power of its will. No change would come from a cell without will, only a poison that would consume the subject. In other words, the torturous experiments were being repeated with no hope of success.</p>
<p id="line_1091">For the subjects, this environment was hell itself. That is why the subjects selected were not the best people, but rather orphans and slaves who would not cause a fuss if they were disposed of. And then there were the criminals.

<p id="line_1103">That is why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was thinking of acting cautiously and responding flexibly.

<p id="line_1104">Located in the forest on the outskirts of the Royal Capital, was one of the exits to the passageway. By entering through there, it was very easy to get in without being affected by the Barriers that guarded the capital. And that wasn’t the only fortune.</p>

<p id="line_1107">“Oh, I knew it. The people trapped in this cage are experimental subjects for our research here.”</p>

<p id="line_1114">“You are…?”</p>
<p id="line_1115">“Heh, I’m Vega. I guess you could say I’m your senior.”</p>
<p id="line_1116">“Senior…you said?”</p>
<p id="line_1117">“Yeah. I’m someone who was once used as a test subject here. I was lucky to escape, but it’s still a bad memory that gives me nightmares.”</p>

If Vega was going to help him, then there was no way he could refuse. However, Vega and the others were too suspicious. He wondered if he could really trust them, though that was only for a moment. After all, if he turned down their offer, all that awaited him was destruction. He would lose his mind in fear and despair and die in the not-too-distant future. It would be better if he could pass away without suffering…when he thought more about it, it was much better to be deceived here.</p>

It was understandable. The divine structure known as the ‘Heaven’s Tower’ had been restored to its former function. In other words, a door to the heavens had opened. Originally, the Heaven’s Tower was a divine fortress that could protect them from any enemy. But this time, the Heaven’s Tower had become a battlefield. It was inevitable that the people living in this land would be very upset.</p>
<p id="line_1172">What’s more, the presence that came down from there was familiar to the old giants. Even before they could see the enemy, the giants were disturbed. There were many individual differences in the lifespan and abilities of giants.</p>
<p id="line_1173">First of all, there was no lifespan for the ancient individuals. They were times when they would be replaced by their successors by entrusting their memories and powers to them, but that was only a measure in case they were killed in battle. Spares and replacement individuals did have lifespans, but these lifespans grew longer with each generation, and even the most recent generation had lifespans of several hundred years. And as for their abilities, the ancient individuals had powers worthy of being called gods.</p>
<p id="line_1174">The Giants were huge, ranging from 2 to 2.5 meters at their normal size, but they grew several times larger in battle. The strength of their bodies was the true essence of the Giants. In the case of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the oldest of the Giants, the difference between his normal size and battle size was more than tenfold. In other words, he could grow to over 20 meters in size.</p>
<p id="line_1175">Among the Giants, there was one who was as strong as or even stronger than <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That was his younger brother, Fenn. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had three brothers, but his youngest brother was a tyrant who had lost control of his emotions while maintaining his intellect and reason. He was sealed away by Veldanava, and since then, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had kept the seal. That is why he had not been able to move from this land, even though his territory had been turned into a desert.</p>
<p id="line_1176">The place where Fenn was sealed was the Heavenly Star Palace. And there was only one way to get there, through Heaven’s Tower. There were other ways, but that was reserved for those who possessed the key. Incidentally, there was only one owner of the key. Only Veldanava’s sister, Velzard, was allowed to open the gates to the Heavenly Star Palace. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> knew this, so the situation was not unexpected.</p>

It reminded him of the Walpurgis the other day. Selfish <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s had been repeatedly asserting themselves while still being considerate of their opponents’ positions. They seemed to have no sense of cooperation, yet their opinions were strangely united.</p>
<p id="line_1181">In accordance with the terms of the agreement, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s subordinates had been busy coordinating the ‘magic transfer circle’ until just the other day. They had now settled down, just in time for the final battle. He was impressed at how hard they worked, and they had done a perfect job. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was also very pleased and held a grand feast to thank the team for their hard work.</p>
<p id="line_1182">Now it felt a little lonely, since there was only <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ultima" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and her friends left as their guests. The ‘magic transfer circle,’ which looked like an art form depending on one’s point of view, shone brightly and sat in the center of the lower floor. However, it was its performance that was noteworthy. The purpose of the magic circle was said to be for allowing people to come and go in case of emergency, but in truth, there was no doubt that the creator had their eyes set on the distant future. Although it was a makeshift project this time, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> believed it to be a great enough achievement. If it could be used to move troops, it could also be used on a large number of merchants.</p>
<p id="line_1183"><em><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, huh. Someone who cannot be underestimated. By using the magicules in the air, he created such a complex magical device that’s accessible to everyone. There may be a limit to the number of times one can use it but it’s only a matter of refilling the magicule supply. It would be much safer than crossing through that magical desert.</em></p>
<p id="line_1184">In this abandoned and dying land, it was all they could do to import enough food to satisfy their people. The Giants could not live by eating nothing. They needed to eat enough food to keep up with their huge bodies, and the younger they were, the more energy they consumed. It was a sign of life, but in a sense, it was also a curse. They exported the materials of desert <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and depended on the food supplies from other countries. To do this, young men and women became travelers, crossing the harsh desert over and over again. This was the reality of the ‘Holy Void’ Damargania.</p>
<p id="line_1185">However, with this ‘magic transfer circle,’ they would be free from such hardships. Until now, it had been common knowledge that food and other things could not be teleported. But now, in the future, such problems would be solved.</p>
<p id="line_1186"><em>It’s scary.

He admired his recklessness and did not want to make an enemy of him. However, someone had come to interrupt <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s excitement.

Even she was at a loss for words in the face of the abominable reality of those horrible insects. Or perhaps she simply hated insects. Otherwise, she would not have asked Zalario to come forward to take charge of the more dangerous World-destroying Dragon. Regardless of such a backstory, now was not the time to be escaping reality. Milim spoke up.</p>
<p id="line_1238">“Hey, Frey. Is it okay if I blow them up with ‘Drago Nova?”’</p>
<p id="line_1239">Hearing this, Frey pondered, “Well…”</p>
<p id="line_1240">It wasn’t a bad idea. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was looking at Milim expectantly, and it seemed like a good idea to allow it. If Frey had been uneasy with insects, she would have agreed to the idea without a thought. However, Frey decided to wait. She had no particular reason to oppose the idea, but she had a bad feeling about it.</p>
<p id="line_1241">“I suppose it is tactically possible to make a maximum attack on the first move. But I think it is also a good idea to expose your opponent’s capabilities while they are still unknown.”</p>
<p id="line_1242">Frey rejected Milim’s idea, saying that it was too uncertain. With so many enemies, it would be tempting to have Milim wipe them out. However, she decided that the insectars should not be underestimated. The reason was that she knew Zegion.</p>
<p id="line_1243">Frey had fought ‘Insect Queen’ Apito, but she had also observed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Zegion’s fight.

This time, the enemy was the same species as Zegion.</p>
<p id="line_1244">“Honestly, maybe I’m just overly concerned, but I don’t think we should underestimate our enemy.”</p>
<p id="line_1245">No one laughed at Frey for being soft when she said this. On the contrary, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> agreed with her.</p>
<p id="line_1246">“No, I agree with Frey. That kind of intuition is not to be taken lightly, and I myself feel that we should be cautious about what we do. I don’t think Milim has anything to worry about, but let’s go for it.”</p>

<p id="line_1248">“Well, the problem is that there are so many of them, but their individual strengths are closer to B rank. If we destroy the A-ranked insects that appear to be the commanders, the rest will just be a ragtag bunch. Since the commanders’ strengths are distinct, it won’t be difficult to find the targets. It might be easier than we think.”</p>
<p id="line_1249">And so, he was saying something rash, based on his own brainless standards.</p>
<p id="line_1250"><em>That is not a strategy</em>—that’s what Frey thought, but then she remembered that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s subordinates were used to such recklessness and swallowed her words.</p>

<p id="line_1268">The first group to be introduced was the main unit led by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—the ‘Flying Beast Knights<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="‘Hi-jū kishi-dan (飛獣騎士団)’  -&gt;  Flying Beast Knights/Knight Order. Can also be called the ‘Order/Knights of the Flying Beasts’" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>.’ The leader was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Suphia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and her second-in-command was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Phobio" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The former ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Beast Master" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s Warrior Alliance,’ a thousand members strong, was leading the remnants of Clayman’s army and the warriors of the Beast Kingdom. The number of warriors had multiplied by a hundred, creating an army of 100,000. Add to this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s command, and it made for a fearless army.</p>
<p id="line_1269">Next to be introduced was ‘Milim’s Guards,’ a super-elite unit directly led by Frey. Lucia and Claire acted as adjutants, providing support to Frey, the commander. The knights of the skies soared while riding the flying magic beasts (gryphons) that were Frey’s tiger cubs. They numbered a little over 3,000. The team was led by Frey’s close aides, the ‘Soaring Flock’ with each unit consisting of ten to thirty riders. Although the gryphons were rank one magic beasts, their strength had been raised to rank by being trained by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. With the elite warriors of the Beast Kingdom and the Sky Queen’s elite guards from all over the world riding on them, their overall strength exceeded A rank.</p>
<p id="line_1270">In addition, the Soaring Flock members were all affected by Frey’s awakening, and their individual strengths were equivalent to the high A ranks. There were some who were comparable to Special A rank, and they were a considerable force to be reckoned with. In this world, it was the largest army consisting of only those above A rank. Although they were only a little over 3,000 in numbers, they were fierce warriors who could easily fight in the air with high-speed maneuvers as one.</p>
<p id="line_1271">Finally, the last group to be introduced were the logistical support troops that had been gathered in a hurry. Although <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the representative, they were actually commanded by Hermes. There were stray <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, human mercenaries, and Clayman’s former subordinates. It was a mixed unit consisting of a variety of people, but they had been entrusted to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to assist in the battle. Most of them had been involved in construction work until then, and their individual strengths ranged from D rank to B rank at best. Their temperament was not suited for fighting, and their duties were to carry supplies, procure food, and assist the priests as medics. However, they were numerous and numbered about 100,000.</p>
<p id="line_1272">This was the entirety of Milim’s force, which totaled over 200,000. It was a formation in which the combat troops were in the front, protecting the support troops. In addition to this, there were reinforcements from Tempest.</p>
<p id="line_1273">Most conspicuous was the army led by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. They had been summoned for the construction of Milim’s castle city, but they had gone straight into the defensive battle. Although not all of them had been sent to support other divisions, the Yellow Numbers and the Orange Numbers totaled to 35,000 people. They were a force specialized in defense, but the Yellow Numbers were particularly impressive.</p>
<p id="line_1274">With <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s evolution, the fighting ability of the high orcs under his command had also greatly increased, and the number of members has risen to 10,000. Some of them had even reached rank A, making them a fearsome army on average. The Orange Numbers had also gained combat experience and were now an army of warriors. Their average rank was B, and they were as strong as any knightly order. In addition, when combined with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s authority, they would serve as a shield to protect their allies with an ironclad defense. This time, they would not go to the front lines, but would protect the rear.</p>
<p id="line_1275">And let us not forget the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hiryuu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ led by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. There were only a hundred of them, but all of them were Special A rank which was a ridiculous force. They were planning to participate in this battle in a flexible manner, going as wild as they wished.</p>
<p id="line_1276">Lastly, there was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Esprit" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Even though there were only two of them, they were still considered a formidable force. With these reinforcements, they were going to fight against the army of Insect Lord <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Zelanus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but it was still going to be a tough battle. After all, the enemy numbered more than three million, more than ten times their own numbers. The wriggling insects were coming to them like a gush of water. And so, the dawn of war was about to begin.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Rather than ‘dawn of war’ the word used was ‘sentan (戦端)’ meaning ‘opening of hostilities’ or even ‘edge of war’" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1277">First up was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1278">“If Milim won’t do it, then I guess it’s my turn.”</p>
<p id="line_1279">And with that said, she happily stepped forward.</p>
<p id="line_1280">“Well, I really wanted to show them what I could do, but Frey didn’t want me to. It can’t be helped, so I’ll let <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> have this one.”</p>
<p id="line_1281">Milim didn’t stop either. Before they had realized it, the two had become best friends.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The word used here for best friends is ‘mabudachi’ which is the same word Milim uses for Rimuru.

As long as they were enjoying themselves, that’s all they cared about, and they only increased each other’s power to do so.</p>
<p id="line_1282">That’s right, power. Power was strength! And strength was destructive force.</p>
<p id="line_1283">“Damn insects, I’ll give you annihilation! The ultimate and most powerful—‘Abyss Annihilation’!!”</p>
<p id="line_1284"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a master at unleashing the most powerful magic from the very first move. With this, more than two million insects were extinguished. The gap of more than ten times was now reduced to four times. Seeing this, the faces of the soldiers who had been lamenting the hopeless difference in strength were filled with hope. At first glance, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s action may have seemed foolhardy, but it was optimal in terms of boosting morale. By reducing the enemy’s numbers before they could inflict casualties, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had kept her forces strong and increased their will to fight. With this, it seemed that the battle would suddenly turn in their favor—that’s what they thought, but…</p>
<p id="line_1285">Frey’s bad premonition came true.</p>
<p id="line_1286">“It can’t be?! That one’s channeling my magic to the Otherworld…”</p>
<p id="line_1287">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s magic… I can’t believe it, but it’s true. This is why I hate insectars. Some of them can nullify magic, truly, they are our natural enemies.”</p>
<p id="line_1288">It was exactly as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Esprit" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s magic had been redirected by a single insectar. A feminine insectar with beautiful long, slender, iridescent wings. Her name was Peliod, and she was one of the Twelve Insect Generals who had absolute superiority over magic.</p>
<p id="line_1289">“Well now, this is not the time to be impressed.

She sensed the situation with her Unique Skill ‘Discerner,’ and deployed her own defense magic to reinforce the ‘Defense Barrier’ that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had put up.</p>
<p id="line_1292">“—What?”</p>
<p id="line_1293">Frey was wondering, and that’s when it opened. There was a strange distortion in the sky.</p>
<p id="line_1294">“Hm, just as I thought.”</p>
<p id="line_1295">“That’s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama for you! She was able to decipher that complicated magic rewrite in one shot.”</p>
<p id="line_1296">“Naturally, or rather, it’s something basic. But more importantly, can we withstand it?”</p>
<p id="line_1297">“Huh, then I’ll help. If this castle is destroyed, Frey will be furious!”</p>
<p id="line_1298">As soon as she said that, Milim also held out her hand to the sky. Then, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘Barrier,’ <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Esprit" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s defensive magic, and Milim’s protective curtain, were activated simultaneously. Immediately after that, a wave of destruction poured down from the rift in the heavens. It was, as expected, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s very same ‘Abyss Annihilation.’</p>
<p id="line_1299">“Wait, could this be—”</p>
<p id="line_1300">“Oh, come on, you mean that…”</p>
<p id="line_1301">Frey used her brain to guess what had happened. And <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, with his instincts, also sensed what was going on.

<p id="line_1302">“I see, so <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono’s magic was channeled into the Otherworld and its exit was reconnected above our heads. What an absurd thing to do…”</p>
<p id="line_1303">That was the correct answer. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the only one who couldn’t see what was going on, but that couldn’t be helped. It was as if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who excelled in magic, was having her most powerful magic spell being thrown back at her. That was difficult to believe even if it was explained, so it would be unreasonable for one to imagine it.</p>
<p id="line_1304">In the first place, it was hard to believe that such imitation was even possible. In any case, for now, they had no choice but to let <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others do their best, and they all prepared for the impact with bated breath. And for a few moments, there was a violent flickering of light and an impact that could turn the world upside down. It gradually converged and eventually subsided. After the tremors had died down, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> finally spoke up.</p>

She then made a casual remark, but the others paled when they heard it. This time, the power had been reduced to less than thirty percent, so they were able to endure somehow. Even so, the terrain around the castle was badly damaged and the streets and other parts of the city were no longer visible. Reconstructing this area would be a headache, but fortunately, no human casualties were reported. But what if this had been ‘Drago Nova’?</p>
<p id="line_1307">“Wahahahaha! My magic is not so easy to control. It’s possible, but I think that only some of its power would be returned.”</p>
<p id="line_1308">“Even it is only some of it, we might not be able to prevent. What is it called? That magic is based on an unknown theory. It’s impossible to rewrite the laws, and I’m not sure if we’ll be able to defend ourselves.”</p>

<p id="line_1311">That was a very good point. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was surprisingly smart and had a great sensitivity in this aspect. It was Milim who replied.</p>
<p id="line_1312">“No, it was returned. That person has mastered ‘Spatial Domination’ to great effect. It seems that she specializes in computing power, but I’m sure that she can change the flow of any directional magic, regardless of its nature.”</p>

<p id="line_1315">If it was a spell that didn’t have a time lag, she wouldn’t have time to pass it off, but that wouldn’t be enough to inflict a fatal blow. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> felt as if she had been deprived of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s greatest asset, which was to read and fight with magic.

<p id="line_1319">“That’s right. In fact, we were able to reduce the number of enemies with zero damage, so if you only look at the results, it was a great success!”</p>

<p id="line_1321">Milim and Frey were right.

<p id="line_1328">“Hahaha, sounds interesting. Then I’ll take the one who’s slouching over there.”</p>
<p id="line_1329">The one in front of her was Zess, who was sitting on the back of a flying insectar. As the head of Insect Generals, his presence was tremendous.</p>

<p id="line_1349">“To be honest, I am not good enough, so I think it’s safer to watch the battle situation carefully and join someone else’s support. If I overexert myself and end up losing, I’ll only be dragging us down…”</p>
<p id="line_1350">It was a very wise decision. For once, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Esprit" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was not slacking off.</p>
<p id="line_1351">“You’re right. If you underestimate the Insect Generals, you’ll get hurt. I don’t have much experience in fighting them, but I know that they’re not ones to be taken lightly.”</p>
<p id="line_1352">In fact, many of her friends had been killed by insectars. In particular, the one named Zess, whom <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was headed towards, was said to be a challenge even for Zalario.

Therefore, the three remaining members decided to wait and see how the battle would go.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1353"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who had taken the lead, was the first to meet the enemy.</p>
<p id="line_1354">“A hindrance.”</p>
<p id="line_1355">And with that, she beat up and killed a bunch of enemies at once, running across the battlefield. At the other end of the field, she fired her Golden Gun at Zess, who was standing calmly. But Zess easily avoided it. Even a supersonic bullet at close range was nothing more than an insignificant toy to Zess.</p>
<p id="line_1356">“Wow, you’re not bad.” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was impressed.</p>
<p id="line_1357">She transformed the Golden Gun into a military sword with a golden blade.</p>
<p id="line_1358">“I’m <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The one who will reap your life.”</p>
<p id="line_1359">“Nonsense. Such a joke, you’ll have to wait until I’m on my feet before you can talk like that.”</p>
<p id="line_1360">With those words, the battle had begun.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1361">Frey jumped out at the same time as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and without waiting for orders, the Soaring Flock surrounded her. Naturally, ‘Milim’s Guards’ followed suit. They were not entirely dedicated to escorting Milim, but this was not a problem because their roles changed in wartime. In the first place, Milim did not need guards. Now that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Obera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was still there, Frey could rampage without worry. So, while kicking flying insects to the curb, Frey made contact with Torun.</p>
<p id="line_1362">Torun was an Insect General with a shiny metallic exoskeleton to protect himself. He was stocky and not very smart. Looking closer, he was surprisingly large, reaching a height of two meters. However, he was a powerful creature that should not be underestimated. By using his two pairs of wings like a dragonfly, he was able to freely fly in a variety of ways.</p>
<p id="line_1363">Frey realized that Torun was troublesome when he evaded her just as she thought she had struck her first blow. Torun had dodged her claws from a high-speed flight while still staying in the air. This was due to the difference in the way they flew, and Torun seemed to have the advantage in aerial combat. Torun’s compound eyes could catch Frey’s movements as if they were in slow motion. Although Torun was inferior to Frey in terms of straight-line speed, he could easily predict where Frey would move, making evasion a simple matter.</p>
<p id="line_1364">Torun did not possess any special skills. His power was divided between the strength of his exoskeleton, predicting the future, and his flight speed. Although simple, Torun had a very strong ability composition. In particular, the nature of its fists was a special bio-organic steel material called ‘alienium,’ and its strength surpassed even that of adamantite. It was strong enough to reach the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> level. Equipped with all the important elements of combat—reaction speed, defense, and offense—Torun was inferior to Frey in terms of existence value, but superior in terms of combat ability. Frey, who had planned to take out the enemy general at full speed, was about to suffer a major miscalculation. However, Torun made a mistake at this point.</p>
<p id="line_1365">“Kishi, Kishishishishi. You, slow. Me, fast.”</p>
<p id="line_1366">“Hah?”</p>
<p id="line_1367">With this single comment, Frey lost her temper. Milim would speak of this later. Frey was by no means a mild-mannered person. Anyone who made stupid remarks would soon learn firsthand how foolish they were. Because Milim was always being scolded, her words carried a lot of weight. And Torun would soon understand the meaning of these words with his own flesh.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1368"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was following Frey with the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hiryuu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ in tow.</p>
<p id="line_1369">“Everyone, the enemy is an insectar, the same species as Zegion-dono and Apito-dono. I think you all understand how strong they are, but you must not let your guard down!”</p>

They had always been beaten severely during their training in the labyrinth. Everyone was aware of the danger and remained overly vigilant. Kakushin, Sukerou, and Yashichi followed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as he swept away the swarm of insects that filled the sky with his breath.</p>
<p id="line_1371">“Hey, hey, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama! Are you going to help Frey-sama?”</p>
<p id="line_1372">“Hm? If she’s struggling, then I’d be happy to help—”</p>
<p id="line_1373"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed uncomfortable with Yashichi’s question. He thought that Frey would not be pleased. Rather, there was someone else he was worried about.</p>
<p id="line_1374">“Mm, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, there’s someone over there who seems dangerous.”</p>
<p id="line_1375">Sukerou had discovered the person <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had been worried about.</p>
<p id="line_1376">“Yes. He looks vaguely like Apito-dono, but I sense a more vicious presence!”</p>
<p id="line_1377">And Kakushin responded with a similar reaction to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s concern. That’s right, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had also perceived his existence to be a greater threat than Apito. Apito’s existence value was lower than <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s, but when it came to combat, they were practically even. His odds of winning were not that high, and he was always forced to fight his hardest. And yet, the presence of this creature was more frightening than Apito.</p>
<p id="line_1378"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s instincts told him. This guy is dangerous. The creature’s name was Beathop. He was an Insect General with the characteristics of a bee and a grasshopper. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was at a loss as to what to do.

Because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had ordered him not to die, he felt that he should not try to fight a battle that he could not win. Although he had been carried away by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s enthusiasm, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was not that much of a fighter. He wanted to test his skills as a warrior, but he did not want to fight for his life.</p>

There was such a thing as battle compatibility, so there was no need to give up the advantage of being able to fly. He didn’t need to go to the trouble of challenging a dangerous opponent here, so he could just find an easier opponent to beat. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought as such and went to find another general—However, that was too naive.</p>
<p id="line_1381">“Hey, don’t run away!”</p>
<p id="line_1382">Beathop was a formidable Insect General. In an instant, he had closed the distance between them and was floating in front of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

Beathop, like Torun, also had the exoskeleton of his limbs turned into alienium. The same was true of the vital parts of his head and torso. He had a slender body, and his flight speed exceeded that of Torun’s. He was an Insect General with cheat-like combat abilities. While his defense was equal to Torun’s, his attack was greater than his. Even if they were to simply compare existence values, he was superior to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

If it had been a one-on-one match without thinking about the future, he would have already unleashed a Burst Roar and defeated Abart long ago. But that was not the case because this was a battlefield. There were other Insect Generals in the area, and he couldn’t show them his secret moves.</p>
<p id="line_1391">Besides, unlike in the labyrinth, death was the end. The most important thing in a battle was to survive, so he had to find a way to fight without overworking himself while also preserving his strength.

Needless to say, his reddish-purple exoskeleton was made of alienium. And from his tail oozed a deadly poison that would kill anybody who touched it. The poisonous scorpion (Sasori), Saril.

There was no fear on their faces, and they looked coldly at the approaching enemies. The enemy forces were of various shapes and sizes.

<p id="line_1443">Now, it was a race against time.

<p id="line_1470">It can’t be?!

Isn’t this bad?›</p>
<p id="line_1474">It was bad. Of all the possible situations, having no contact was the most dangerous.</p>
<p id="line_1475"><em>This is why I prepared a manual for just such a situation,</em> while complaining in my heart, I told them through ‘Telepathy Net’ to continue collecting information. Ramiris seemed to have remembered the existence of the manual after I pointed it out to her. “I’m not panicking at all”—she said as she went back to talking with the other operators. In any case, without information, there was no way to make a decision. That being the case, perhaps we should give up on the buffet party tonight…</p>
<p id="line_1476">At a time like this, I was reminded of an incident in my previous life. Yes, it was when I was still in my twenties and working as a general contractor. That day was the scheduled day of a major update to an MMORPG, which had become a daily routine for me, and I was excitedly waiting for my work to finish. Just as I was about to finish my work, the machine broke down…</p>
<p id="line_1477"><em>No way</em>, I had thought. We hadn’t even finished cleaning up the site when the machine stopped working. Until the machine was repaired, all other work would be stopped…and that was the moment I knew I would have to work overtime.</p>
<p id="line_1478">After giving instructions to arrange for night lighting, I contacted the relevant authorities such as the municipal office and the police, explained the situation, and completed the work that I could do by myself. I didn’t have time to mourn, as I went around explaining the situation to the local residents as necessary. I had so much to do that I found myself working long past regular working hours.</p>
<p id="line_1479">What I am feeling now was just like what I had been feeling back then. In other words, I had to give up seeing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s dress. If we had to invade two places at the same time, we would have to be prepared for a long battle. It would be impossible to finish the job by nightfall. There was a high possibility that one of the battlefields was a decoy, and there was no way to deal with it in a euphoric mood. However, I decided to never forget the resentment that was welling up in my heart. I had to teach those fools that taking away my fun time came at a steep price…</p>
<p id="line_1480">With that in mind, I changed my mindset and began thinking of countermeasures.</p>

<p id="line_1482">“Something’s wrong, isn’t it?”</p>
<p id="line_1483">I nodded and explained briefly.</p>

<p id="line_1488">“I understand.”</p>
<p id="line_1489">This is fine.

<p id="line_1491">‹I’m checking, but it looks like the situation is pretty bad.›</p>
<p id="line_1492">He responded without panic, but the situation seemed to be quite tense. I waited for the rest of the report, hoping that the damage was not worse than expected.</p>
<p id="line_1493">‹I’ve received word. Surprisingly, both forces are evenly matched. It seems that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s supreme magic was the beacon that started the war, but there was someone on the enemy side who could throw it back, and it turned into a head-on collision—›</p>
<p id="line_1494">Throwing back <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s magic?! I was wondering how a spell with such crazy power could be thrown back, but was it possible with the ‘Spatial Domination’ ability?</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1495">«It depends on one’s computing power, but it is possible. It also depends on the scale and power of the spell being thrown, but if it’s a directional destructive spell, it is possible to channel the power by distorting space. If a mistake is made, your own allies will be harmed, so it is not recommended.»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1496">I see. If you take too much time to predict the point of impact, your teammates may get caught. And if the prediction fails, needless to say, you will be hit hard. I suppose <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san can do it, but unless there was no other way, it would be rejected.</p>
<p id="line_1497">If you think of it that way, it’s a strategy built on the sacrifice of your allies, and the risk of failure is too great, making the enemy seems like a very daring gambler. So, because of that, it became a head-on collision, and the enemy had eight Insect Generals. The official name of the group was the ‘Twelve Insect Generals,’ but now there are only eight Insect Generals left, not twelve, so the group was all together.</p>
<p id="line_1498">In addition to this, there was the presence of the Insect Lord <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Zelanus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and Milim could not move. Therefore, the ‘Milim <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Four Heavenly Kings" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ and even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Carrera" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others all joined in to fight the Insect Generals. What’s with the ‘Milim <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Four Heavenly Kings" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’?—putting aside the question, I was amazed that even the number was the same.</p>
<p id="line_1499">‹So, do you think we can win?›</p>
<p id="line_1500">‹I’m not sure, but I’m sure there will be some tough opponents.›</p>
<p id="line_1501">‹All right. In any case, let’s send reinforcements.›</p>

He didn’t waste any time and acted quickly and decisively. The ‘magic transfer circle’ could only transfer about fifty people at a time, but if we replenished the magicule ourselves, we could operate continuously. In addition, since there were plenty of magicules in our labyrinth, the time required to reuse them would be short. With Veldora’s help this time, we were able to send 300 people out safely. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobua" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the commander, was also very motivated.</p>

<p id="line_1505">‹That’s fine, but I’m worried if they’ll have enough forces.›</p>
<p id="line_1506">When you hear that the number of enemies exceeds one million, it’s natural to worry with only three hundred additional people. The quality of the individual people was very good, as they were all Over A rank.

<p id="line_1540">Hmm, that was a good suggestion, but I was concerned about the fact that they were so powerful.

<p id="line_1547">It would be fine if we were just playing around, but this was a serious battle. I gave her a firm warning to fulfill her duty.</p>

It was Fenn.

Fenn was slender yet tall like a giant, and his supple muscles were toned. His skin was white. It was morbidly white, having been depigmented by isolation in a sunless room for an uncanny number of years. His green hair was long and shaggy, and his eyes shone like jade. He wore a long, loose robe with an open bust. Accentuating his appearance were the chains wrapped around his waist and shoulders.</p>
<p id="line_1549">The Gleipnir<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The special chains that were sealing him are called Gleipnir." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> that had bound him for years was now Fenn’s favorite.

At first glance, he seemed defenseless, but that was not the case. He was moving like a martial arts master, ready to respond to any attack. Fenn smirked.</p>
<p id="line_1550">“I’ve missed you, Brother.”</p>
<p id="line_1551">Fenn called out to him, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> let out a big sigh.</p>

<p id="line_1555">“Huh! You’ve changed, Brother. You used to be such a cool guy.”</p>
<p id="line_1556">Fenn responded with a disgruntled look.

Under the tremendous pressure, the Heaven’s Tower, which should be indestructible, shook violently. The next moment, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s fist plunged into Fenn’s face with an impact that seemed to pierce the earth and sky. However, Fenn held his ground.</p>
<p id="line_1565">Then, in return, he squatted down deeply and delivered a heavy, sharp uppercut into <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s stomach. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s body flew helplessly in the air, but Fenn seized the moment and threw a kick to his legs. The impact of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s massive body hitting the wall made the Heaven’s Tower creak as if it were about to collapse.

<p id="line_1567">“It’s the same with brother. Any normal person would’ve been done by now, you know?”</p>
<p id="line_1568">“Don’t underestimate me. The name ‘Octagram’ is something to live up to.”</p>
<p id="line_1569">“You seem to like it.”</p>
<p id="line_1570">“Quite a bit, yeah!”</p>
<p id="line_1571">As soon as he replied, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> unleashed the full power of fighting spirit. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had an existence value of over 40 million. Although Fenn’s existence value was greater, his pressure was also comparable to that of the True Dragons—The battle was left to each side’s abilities.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1572">Leon quietly stepped onto the battlefield. Standing in front of him was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s younger brother and Fenn’s older brother, Glassord. He was about two meters tall, large by other races’ standards but small by Giants’ standards. His skin color was yellow, somewhere between that of his older and younger brothers. His eyes were purple and had an intellectual glow to them. He had the tendency to believe that he must remain open-minded<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Rairaku (磊落)  -&gt;  open-minded/open-hearted, free and easy, to not be bothered by unimportant things." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> because of the hardships he had suffered as a result of being sandwiched between his unrestrained older brother and free-spirited younger brother.</p>
<p id="line_1573">He was aware of this, but he could not help his innate temperament. It is for this reason that Glassord used a two-handed sword (Greatsword), a weapon that emphasized technique, which was unusual for Giants who exceled in bare-handed or clubbed weapons. He did not carry a shield and his fighting style was completely offensive, but that was a sign of his confidence.</p>
<p id="line_1574">Although Glassord’s existence value was just under 2 million, and although he seemed fragile compared to his brothers, he was undoubtedly a million-class competitor. And his skill-level was the highest among the three brothers.</p>
<p id="line_1575">“You are <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon-dono, I presume. My name is Glassord. I am the second-in-command of the Titan Corps. I would have preferred to test my skills against you when you were not being deprived of your free will, but that will have to wait for another time—I will give up the win for today.”</p>

<p id="line_1581">“If you’d be willing to stall for time, I’d be more than happy to do so.”</p>

<p id="line_1585">In other words, he was declaring that he wouldn’t use his skills. He knew from Leon’s battle that he didn’t need to fight with all his might.

She had assessed Pico and Gracia’s fighting ability and concluded that they were weaker than she. She was right. Pico and Gracia were not weak, and were of course million-class, but their existence values were around 2 million, a step below <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ultima" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_1607">While exchanging such casual remarks, the head-on collision began.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1608">The battle between <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Fenn was, to the casual observer, extremely intense. But in reality, neither of them was serious. If they had been, everyone in the area would have been put under the pressure of their fighting spirit, and some of them might not have been able to even stand. At the very least, it would have been less of a battle. But the time for observation would soon be over. The other groups did not want to fight in the small building and moved to their own battlefields. As a result, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Fenn were the only ones left in the multi-storied Heaven’s Tower.</p>
<p id="line_1609">“It’s been a while since I’ve been this heated. Brother, I’m about to get serious.”</p>
<p id="line_1610">“Hmph! That’s what I want.”</p>
<p id="line_1611">Fenn’s fighting spirit swelled. His power, rivaling that of the True Dragon, exerted a visible pressure on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was not to be defeated either.</p>
<p id="line_1612">“Nnngh!”</p>
<p id="line_1613">And, by letting his own fighting aura permeate his body, he transformed his muscles into something specialized for combat. This was the start of a full-scale battle between the two brothers, and each of their goals was non-negotiable. Fenn wanted the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of his rampaging days back. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, on the other hand, was seeking stability and order. He was willing to go to war if necessary, but he was not willing to go to war in vain. They had incompatible goals. However, the winner of this fight would be able to make his opponent follow their wishes. Because—</p>
<p id="line_1614">The battle would intensify. And so, little by little, Fenn gradually began to gain the upper hand in what had been a tight competition. The difference in strength was apparent. In addition to that, the decisive factor was the Gleipnir, a chain that Fenn could control at will. Veldanava had created it with his own hands, and it was an indestructible chain that boasted strength and flexibility above even the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Fenn had been bound by it for so many years that he had come to be able to control Gleipnir as if it were a part of his own body.</p>
<p id="line_1615">“Kuh, you’re so cocky…you’ve gained even more strength than before to have pushed me so far like this—Eh?!”</p>
<p id="line_1616"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was caught off guard and had his hands and feet twisted together by Gleipnir. He had an expression of anguish on his face. Fenn smirked.</p>
<p id="line_1617">“Brother—you’d better accept the memories of the pain I deeply experienced!!”</p>
<p id="line_1618">And with that, he delivered a powerful headbutt. A moment later, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Fenn’s souls touched, and their memories and emotions crossed. What resulted from this was the sharing of memories. As a result—</p>

<p id="line_1620">“Do you remember now, Brother?”</p>
<p id="line_1621">“Hmph, I feel like I’m awake.”</p>
<p id="line_1622">“I see, well that’s good.”</p>
<p id="line_1623">Fenn’s smile deepened. He then offered his hand to his brother <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in a gesture of affection. That hand was clasped tightly—</p>
<p id="line_1624">“Now then, it’s time to fight. Let’s show the world the might of our Titan Army!”</p>
<p id="line_1625">“Of course! As expected of Brother, that’s what I’m talking about!”</p>

The member of the Octagram, and the giant <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who guarded the Heaven’s Tower, was no more. The ancient evil deity had returned.</p>

The Titan Army was renamed the ‘Chained Titan Army.’ And they began their march into the barren desert to recreate the tyranny of ancient times. It was not an orderly movement at all. Each of them took their own weapons as they saw fit and acted in accordance with the orders of the king, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Thus, without any preparation time, the collective action was completed with a speed that could make a mockery of the military organization. Even Glassord, who had been in league with Leon, was no exception.</p>
<p id="line_1628">“Hmm, it seems that the reason for hostility has disappeared. From now on, I will be your comrade in battle.”</p>
<p id="line_1629">As soon as he said this to Leon, Glassord left the scene. Leon dealt with this unperturbed. It had been the expected conclusion if Fenn won.

<p id="line_1630">“Hold on, are you kidding me? No matter how much stronger I’ve gotten, this is just too much…”</p>
<p id="line_1631">She was tempted to complain. After all, the number of allies had decreased, and the number of enemies had increased. This was exactly the strategy that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had been aiming for, and now the enemy was trying to pull it off.

No, she shouldn’t take that as a blessing, but she couldn’t help but think that they were lucky, because if they had been targeted right now, they would have been defeated. In any case, the situation was terrible.

Therefore, she had been trying to neutralize them without really trying. But the question was, if she really tried, would she be able to defeat all the enemies in this place? If it was a matter of life and death, the odds would be better.</p>
<p id="line_1639">But even so, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ultima" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> knew that she could not be sure.

The scene we saw on the way was horrific. The giants were gathering in a chaotic manner, and before I knew it, they were forming into a disciplined army. At the head of the group was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but he seemed to be a different person from the one I knew.

<p id="line_1646">I wondered what I should do, but there was only one answer.

<p class="space-break" id="line_1647">And so now, I had just met up with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ultima" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others.

<p id="line_1648">“What, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s here too?!”</p>

<p id="line_1650">I replied, focusing my attention on Leon. Leon seemed to be aware of my intentions.

Although, I didn’t think it was possible for anyone to force a person with a will strong enough to acquire an Ultimate Skill to swear their allegiance wholeheartedly just by their own power. Even if there was such a thing, it would be fake, and the current situation suggested to me that it would only restrict the actions against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s will. So, I decided to do something about the situation. As I had declared, I would start with Leon, leaving <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dino" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> for later.</p>

<p id="line_1652">And so, a huge move was launched right from the start.

<p id="line_1653">“<em>Sigh—</em>even if it were part of the plan, I never want to do that again.”</p>
<p id="line_1654">—Well, he was successfully recovered. Thus, Leon had returned as one of us.

His resistance would probably be small, since he showed no motivation to begin with.</p>
<p id="line_1655"><em>I had put it off, thinking it would be easy to bring him back to his senses, but let’s just finish it all at once.</em> That’s what I thought, but it seems that it was a naive idea.</p>

The Capitol building where the world conference was being held also had conference rooms and guest rooms on other floors. She rented one of these rooms as a temporary command center and began to compile reports from her subordinates. Once she grasped the situation, she let out a sigh as her head began to hurt.</p>
<p id="line_1716">“What the hell is going on…”</p>
<p id="line_1717">She couldn’t help muttering to herself. The Capitol was fully guarded to protect the safety of the dignitaries from various countries.

If the Capitol were to fall, the chain of command would be disrupted, and so the refugees would be received elsewhere. The main hall of the Holy Church in the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was also opened to receive refugees, and there were plenty of refugee centers throughout the capital. This was because the city had always been prepared for the Tenma Great War, which was said to occur every 500 years or so.</p>
<p id="line_1718">This was the case in not only the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but in the Western Nations as well. People were provided with shelters in underground bunkers and caves in the nearby mountainsides. This was also the reason why they could sufficiently cope with the thorough evacuation, which was also on the agenda this time.</p>
<p id="line_1719">Regarding the current terrorist acts in the capital, they made sure to mitigate the human damage by evacuating the residents to such facilities. The purpose of this was to prevent major confusion from occurring and to prepare an environment in which they could concentrate on dealing with the enemy. As of now, the results of the daily training had been demonstrated and the people were successfully led away. The evacuation was complete, and the people who escaped were now calm.</p>
<p id="line_1720">However, this was not a solution to the problem. This time, it was not a natural disaster, but rather the people who caused the disturbance. According to reports, explosions were happening all over the capital, and they were turning into fires. The cause of the fires was said to be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s of Special A rank and above.

It would only increase the anxiety of her subordinates and create unnecessary work for her. Moreover, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> deeply understood that she should not become emotional in front of the evacuees.

Fortunately, the facilities were comfortable and there was a stockpile of food. At any rate, the right thing to do for now was to deal with the enemy without worrying the evacuees.</p>

<p id="line_1724">The enemy wasn’t just on the outside. The evacuees could also turn into a mob at any moment. Things were still calm now, but there was no telling what would happen if it took too long to eliminate the enemy. Those confused by fear, and those who screamed and rioted from anxiety. It was expected that the number of such people would increase as time went on. It all depended on the future situation, but in the worst case, it might be necessary to devote troops to suppress the riots.

<p id="line_1970">Vega was a nuisance.

It might be possible to destroy him by burning down a large area with nuclear magic. But in order to do so, she needed to understand Vega in his entirety.

And now it was ready. The corpses melted and twisted together, and the sludge formed into several humanoid forms. In this moment, a fearsome creature was born into the world. It was a reappearance of the Dead Birthday that produced undead elves with Vega’s power.</p>
<p id="line_2182">Of course, the effect was not the same. That was the true value of the ‘Organic Domination’ and ‘Mass Reproduction’ from Vega’s Ultimate Skill ‘Evil Dragon King Azi Dahaka.’ In Vega’s words, it was ‘Evil Dragon Spawn Production’—it was the power to create evil lifeforms to be his loyal subjects.</p>
<p id="line_2183">There were four Evil Dragon Spawns born in total. Although they resembled human beings, their appearance was nothing short of hideous. The Evil Dragon Spawns’ entire body was covered with black scales that were transformed from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="mythical-grade" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> material. On their bellies were a large rift, reminiscent of a mouth with teeth. On their backs, there were two pairs of the blackened wings of a bird of prey. They appeared to be the remnants of an angel. The head of the creatures were distinctive, with a smooth mass from the neck up. There were two hollow-like holes in them, and red eyes glittered in the blackness.</p>
<p id="line_2184">They were no longer people. They were writhing beings with the presence of evil. They had no heads to begin with, so there was no light of intelligence in their eyes. Nevertheless, they seemed to have the power of judgment, and were glaring hatefully at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Venom" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, perhaps influenced by the hatred they had felt before their deaths.</p>
<p id="line_2185">“Gwahahahahaha!! What do you think of my lovely pets?! It seems that you small fry have been working hard, but that’s all over now. These ‘Evil Dragon Spawns’ are far too powerful for little peons like you, so enjoy them to your hearts’ content!!”</p>
<p id="line_2186">Vega said, laughing loudly. And then, while crossing his arms, he ordered, “Go play with them.”</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2187">Although Evil Dragon Spawns were a distorted life form, they were still very capable of fighting. They had no eyes, but that was no problem since they had ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ to begin with. They could accurately grasp the situation around them and act according to orders. The individual existence values reached 2.4 million. This was more than the average Insect General, so one could understand how much of a threat these Evil Dragon Spawns were. Of course, that was obvious to those who were facing them, without needing to be explained.</p>

The prideful <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Arios" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was too impatient to show his true strength. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘Lucky Field’ had been one of the factors that contributed to bringing out the worst in him.</p>
<p id="line_2190">This time, however, such factors had been eliminated. The creatures’ lack of intelligence may work to their advantage, but for the Evil Dragon Spawns, who’s only remaining assets were their offensive instincts and unparalleled fighting sense, there seemed to be no inconveniences just by being a fighting machine. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Venom" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sensed this intuitively.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_2223">You’re right about that. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s argument was so correct that it was difficult to respond to it.

<p class="space-break" id="line_2224">«It’s okay. I wondered if something like this might happen, so I have already taken steps to deal with this situation—Will you take immediate action?»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2225">Hey, what?! I haven’t heard anything, but you’ve already taken action? I don’t know why you’re trying to deceive me…or rather, you can’t deceive me, so you’re doing it on purpose.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_2227">When you say, “you would” instead of “would you,” I’m guessing that means you’re ready to activate it…</p>

I had no idea how this would affect it. If so, I should just take action instead of worrying. There’s no other answer anyway—in that case, let’s just attack. It wasn’t that I was going to give up and try my best until the end, but rather that I was feeling quite at ease. I would do everything I could with the intention of gathering information for the next battle. I didn’t want this experience to go to waste, even if I had to throw it away. I was risking my life, and I wanted to get as much useful information as I could out of it. With that in mind, I readied my sword. But it seems that I was too naive.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_2280">Hm? Why is that?</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2281">«Because there are very few people who can handle this ability, it is a very valuable experience.

<p class="space-break" id="line_2282">That confidence is as strong as ever. It was only a matter of time, so I guess it was a losing battle to argue while time was stopped. I feel like I’ll be judged otherwise, so I’ll just praise you for this. The question was whether I could actually move when time was stopped. If I couldn’t do that, there would be no talking about it in the future, so it was our urgent task to solve this problem. For now, I had to rely on Chloe…</p>
<p id="line_2283">At any rate, there was nothing I could do right now.

<p id="line_2289">“Hmm, is that so? It was surprisingly easy.”</p>
<p id="line_2290">Chloe just brushed it off. Seeing her response made me remember. Although I couldn’t help but think of her as my own student, Chloe was a great warrior in her own right. After a long, long journey through time, she had reigned as the strongest <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_2292">Ah, I knew it.

<p class="space-break" id="line_2293">«I didn’t even need to help her. It’s very disappointing.»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2294">I suppose it is.

If it had been able to find out the secret, we would have been able to move in the Suspended World by now. No, rather than Chloe being stingy, I think <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was too much of a foul…</p>

<p id="line_2297">“In that case, I must eliminate the uncertainty.”</p>
<p id="line_2298">“I agree. I’ll make you regret making me your enemy.”</p>
<p id="line_2299">After that conversation, the battle between Chloe and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2300">The battle was, in a word, tremendous. As it turned out while watching the battle, the speed of the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="information particle" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ was constant. Conversation had been established and the reaction speed of vision was also constant. This was as clear a physical phenomenon as the fact that ‘all things cannot exceed the speed of light.’ In that case, why did the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="information particle" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s’ exceed the speed of light?</p>
<p id="line_2301">This was not a matter of the speed being exceeded. It was as if the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="information particle" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, which were supposed to be at different coordinates, were transferring information to each other with zero time difference. Regardless of how far they were from each other, as long as the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="information particle" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s existed in the recognizable space, there was no time difference. In other words, an ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="information particle" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ transcended time and space. Our communication had also been established by using the information transfer between <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="information particle" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s.

<p class="space-break" id="line_2303">I knew it. Assuming that the mind and spirit are also information, it’s not impossible. Whether it could be done or not was another matter, but it is significant that there was an answer there. I should have eliminated the thought I couldn’t do it and instead concentrated on how I could get there.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2304">«You’re right. We’ll make the ‘Emergency Response Mode’ even more fully operational, and aim to evolve into a Digital Lifeform, is that okay?»</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2305">Of course, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-kun. I’ll leave it all to you, so please do as you like.</p>
<p id="line_2306">—That’s what I profusely ordered. Because nothing could be done if we didn’t, and if there was a possible countermeasure, we should try everything. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san understood my intentions correctly and energetically started its activities. All that remained was to wait for the results. I was still concerned about the fact that I was leaving everything to others, but it couldn’t be helped anymore. I made up my mind and focused on the battle between Chloe and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 19/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2307">Now then, Chloe and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were quite close in terms of their abilities. I couldn’t tell exactly, so I was just making inferences, but I thought that they were evenly matched in terms of physical ability. Or perhaps I should say that they were evenly matched in their ability to interfere with the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="information particle" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s.’ Since the speed had a fixed maximum value, it was one’s power of interference that determined superiority or inferiority. The key point was how well one could control the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="information particle" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s’ and outperform the enemy. That would be the decisive factor in a ‘Suspended World,’ I guessed.</p>
<p id="line_2308">There were a few more things that I noticed while observing. First, there was no concept of defense in the ‘Suspended World.’ Those who could move, such as Chloe and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, could interfere with each other’s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="information particle" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s to form a unified offensive and defensive battle. On the other hand, those who could not move would be attacked without being able to take any defense. Moreover, the fact that time was stopped meant that all the ‘forces’ were not working. Intermolecular forces such as star attraction and repulsion would not work, and there were no binding forces. There was no inertia and no external factors, so an object retained its original state. In that case, what would happen if something was attacked in this state? The answer was simple—it would collapse in an instant.</p>
<p id="line_2309">Whether it was a reinforced concrete wall, a solid bedrock, or a lump of steel, there was no resistance because the atoms were not even bonded to each other. There was nothing in this world that could endure. That was the conclusion. A world in which all the laws of physics do not apply was a terrifying thing when I thought about it. I wouldn’t know what would happen, and if I entered the world carelessly, I was likely to get severely harmed. Between those who could move in the ‘Suspended World’ and those who couldn’t, there was a dimensional barrier that could never be overcome. With that in mind, I was surprised that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had survived…</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_2311">Whoa, newsflash. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s anticipation of this situation was amazing, but the fact that his magic was also effective in the ‘Suspended World’ was an unexpected bonus.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2312">«However, you cannot activate magic while in the Suspended World. You must prepare for it beforehand, and once its effect is broken, it’s over.»</p>

This was the only time I didn’t think I’d be able to use him, but I thought to myself that he was really reliable under normal circumstances.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2316">—And so, the first thing I noticed was that the ‘Suspended World’ had no concept of defense, but the other thing I noticed was that the person who activated the ‘Suspended World’ seemed to be at a disadvantage. I wasn’t completely sure, but I didn’t think I was wrong. It appeared that stopping time consumed a lot of energy. In that case, there was no point in suspending all the people who were able to move in the ‘Suspended World.’ This time, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> chose not to release the ‘Suspended World’ because he didn’t want me to join in.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_2318">Ah, I see. It’s almost like an electrical appliance.

<p id="line_2337">Chloe had said to reveal all things as they should be, but that was not exactly what she meant. For Chloe, it was to change things into what you think you should be.

However, why would Chloe suddenly kiss me…</p>
<p id="line_2358">“Wasn’t that something <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san needed?

<p id="line_2365">“Oh, that’s still okay.”</p>
<p id="line_2366">She could change her appearance at will, from a baby to an old woman. Whether that made any sense or not, I was relieved that I wouldn’t have to startle Kenya and the others.</p>

She did it as naturally as if she was breathing. It was hard to imagine how much stronger she had become. Even without the assistance of a Manas, she seemed to be able to control her powers to the fullest. At the very least, I didn’t need to be told to know that she was better than me who just relied on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ciel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.

<p id="line_2370">“Yeah, I understand. I’m pretty sure the amount of power I absorbed was less than expected.”</p>
<p id="line_2371">“Got it. Then leave it to me this time. And you, take it easy and get some rest.”</p>
<p id="line_2372">And so, I strongly cautioned Chloe. Even though Chloe appeared to be fine, there was no way she could be safe after evolving so rapidly. I had to make sure she got a good rest, whether she wanted it or not.</p>
<p id="line_2373">“Ufu, I’m glad you’re worried about me.”</p>
<p id="line_2374">“I won’t be fooled.”</p>
<p id="line_2375">Even if she smiles at me in such a cute way, I’m not like Leon. It was time for me to show my dignity as an adult.</p>
<p id="line_2376">“All right. I’ll be quiet for a little while then. So, you won’t lose, right?”</p>
<p id="line_2377">“Of course. Thanks to Chloe, I understand the concept of time.”</p>

<p id="line_2628">“Yes, of course. He seems to be difficult to kill with a sword, and widespread annihilation magic cannot be used in Royal Capital, so let’s share the work.”</p>
<p id="line_2629">As smart people, it was easy for them to come to an agreement. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Testarossa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> stepped back and began to search for the range of influence of the power that Vega had activated. That tended to be neglected while fighting, but this time, she activated her detection spell carefully in order to kill him seriously. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> stood in front of Vega.</p>
<p id="line_2630">“Oh hey, what happened to my buddy Damrada and the other bastard?”</p>
<p id="line_2631">“They have gone back.”</p>
<p id="line_2632">“Hmm, I see. They looked like they were going to do some damage, but they’re not my enemy. Neither are you guys. You got carried away just because you beat my Evil Dragon Spawns, but let me give you a reality check.”</p>
<p id="line_2633">Vega boasted to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. As a former colleague, Damrada had felt that Vega was quite capable. However, he had thought that the current Vega was no match for him and did not consider him a threat. Even so, he felt that it would be annoying to be swarmed by such a strong class of people, so <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words that Damrada had gone back honestly made him happy. Well, it was just that it was less troublesome.</p>
<p id="line_2634">“Well, what do you think? Don’t underestimate me, or you’ll regret it.”</p>
<p id="line_2635">Even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could see that Vega was a very powerful opponent.

<p id="line_2636">He chose to use his greatly increased strength and speed to confront <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> head on. Vega’s stiff arm destroyed an object with a shock wave even though it had not been touched. The same went for his kicks. His entire body had become an incarnation of destruction that surpassed that of strategic weapons, and he was causing extraordinary damage to those around him. If it weren’t for the ‘Material Area,’ the capital would have been reduced to ashes in a matter of minutes. Exposed to such a tyranny, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would normally have been in great trouble.

<p id="line_2644">No matter how terrible Vega’s shockwaves were, they wouldn’t do much damage to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> if it didn’t hit her directly, especially now that she was able to turn into a full spiritual life form as a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

It was a misunderstanding, but to those who did not know the situation, it was the truth. When they saw that the battle was over, they came rushing to the area.

<p id="line_2772"><em>Wow, this is going to be troublesome…</em></p>

He seemed to be refusing the request, saying that if they wanted an audience with His Majesty the Emperor, they should talk to them first. He listened to the conversation, thinking that his escorts were very reliable, but the content of the conversation was very disturbing. It sounded like the king had been assassinated, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had nothing to do with it. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s heart continued to pound as he heard something about an important witness.

<p id="line_2779"><em>That’s such a big deal!</em></p>
<p id="line_2780">It was hard to be involved in such an incident and accept it. But it was also impossible to pretend that he had nothing to do with it now.

Then, as he always did in practice, he tilted his head at an angle and looked down. After a two-second pause, he turned his head to the front and looked at the audience. Just by doing this, the excitement of the people was palpable. It was frighteningly effective.</p>
<p id="line_2781"><em>As expected, it’s exactly as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san told me.</em></p>

By adding the gestures that were calculated to win the hearts of the people, the effect of his Skill was increased. And now that it had evolved into the ‘King of Heroes,’ the effect was enormous.</p>

<p id="line_2784">When <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> quietly began to speak, the excited people fell silent at once. Like a receding wave, the entire area was enveloped in silence. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was inwardly horrified at the unimaginable impact of his influence.

<p id="line_2785"><em>Uh okay, don’t panic and take your time. Even if you stutter or choke a little, it’s fine because there’s a way to fix it!—was that it?</em></p>
<p id="line_2786">Ever since he decided to become Emperor, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had consulted him many times.

<p id="line_2787">“Everyone! What is right and what is wrong? I think it should be obvious from this scene. If you are wise, you will know the right answer without me saying anything. I ask that you believe in that answer, and I want to believe in you, too!”</p>

<p id="line_2907">They were enthusiastically discussing countermeasures. Well, yeah. If you’re not careful, you can make the same mistakes over and over and again. If there is answer for this, it is better to prepare in advance. I think that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others’ actions are not in vain, because they can think of a solution to any problem if given enough time. With that in mind, I decided not to interfere.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2908">It seemed that Leon had not regained consciousness yet, so I ordered <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to take him to Tempest. I didn’t think he’d be a target anymore, but it was just in case. I also ordered <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ultima" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to go to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s aid. Now that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was on the march, I decided that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be the next battleground.</p>
<p id="line_2909">“Kufufufufu, I will be back soon, so it is goodbye for now.”</p>
<p id="line_2910">“Well then, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I’m off!”</p>
<p id="line_2911">And the two immediately sprang into action. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Veyron" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Zonda" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> followed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ultima" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, leaving <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I alone. However, there was still work to be done. Here, we would investigate the ‘Holy Void’ Damargania. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t seem like someone who would betray us, so something must have happened here. I wanted to know what that was, and I also thought I should find out what the current situation was in this city.</p>
<p id="line_2912">“I’m counting on you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>
<p id="line_2913">“Understood!”</p>
<p id="line_2914">It was safe to leave it to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. After giving the instructions, I returned to the capital, which had been my last concern. But apparently, there was no need to panic.</p>
<p id="line_2915">“You’re too late. It’s over.”</p>
<p id="line_2916"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Velgrynd" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> proudly told me what had happened. Surprisingly, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had defeated <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Feldway" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the enemy’s leader.</p>

<p id="line_2918">“Wait a minute! Before you praise me, please listen to what I have to say first!”</p>
<p id="line_2919">Well, yeah. I understood.

But he still won, so he should be proud of it. I was relieved too. Really, I was just glad everyone was okay. I was relieved about it, but it seems that it was too early to relax. Soon after that, reports of the war situation began to arrive from all over the world. It was more horrible than I had imagined…my mind instantly switched to the upcoming battles.</p>

<p class="pagebreak" id="line_2920"></p>
<h1 class="ch-number">Epilogue</h1>
<h1 class="ch-name">Evolving Malice</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_2921">Feeling a great surge of power, it opened its eyes dimly. All it could see were the little people who always got in its way. The being that stood before it was eradicating the swarm of them. It was a force that even it—the ‘World-destroying Dragon’ Ivarage could not ignore, and the carnage ended in the blink of an eye. The victor—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, had left the scene without paying a single thought to Ivarage.</p>
<p id="line_2922">A little uncomfortable with this, Ivarage moved slowly and walked over to the site of the battle. The remains of those who had fought against him for so many years. He unconsciously spoke of the many corpses floating there. Fools who launched feeble attacks that didn’t even itch. Nevertheless, they were comforting to Ivarage’s endless boredom. It was probably because he felt that their deaths were a bit of a waste that he took such a futile action. However—</p>
<p id="line_2923">Such a mere whim brought about an incredible change in Ivarage. Ivarage, a being without intelligence, without reason, and who had done nothing but carry out destructive actions out of instinct, was now imbued with an emotion. Until now, Ivarage’s only purpose in life had been the urge to destroy. But in that moment, he felt ‘hatred.’ It was the germination of an intellect and an emotion. Even the gods could not have foreseen that the grudges of those who were destroyed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would provoke Ivarage.</p>
<p id="line_2924">Moreover, the transformation did not stop there. As a result of taking in more than ten thousand souls, Ivarage had entered a time of evolution.</p>
<p id="line_2925">No.</p>
<p id="line_2926">It should be said that the time had arrived. The evil god would be reborn as an incarnation of malice. More cunning, more evil, and more intent with the goal of destroying the world. Just before it began—the evolution into an evil god, the Halloween Carnival—Ivarage did indeed ‘see’ it. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had left, and the gate to the other world had opened. Looking forward to it, Ivarage fell asleep. What was beyond that gate? And what joyous events awaited him there…</p>
<p id="line_2927">And… And, was there an enemy worthy of this “hatred,” Ivarage wondered, his heart almost bursting with anticipation. These were new emotions; desires he should never have had. But it was too late. The day of awakening of the dreaming evil god, was near.</p>
<h1 class="afterword" id="afterword">Afterword</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_2928">It’s been a long time, everyone.</p>
<p id="line_2929">For the first time, the deadline was extended by one month. I thought it was going to be a disaster when I started writing it, but then I felt that it was actually impossible. As I was rearranging the contents for the completion, various developments came to my mind. The reason was that I couldn’t write them down easily, because whatever I added would have a big influence on the future.</p>
<p id="line_2930">Of course, I had other work to do as well, and one of the reasons was that I couldn’t switch my mindset well. I feel that my brain is not working as well as it used to, and I wonder if it’s my age. When I mentioned this to I-San, he gave me a warm encouragement saying, “Don’t make excuses like that, just write it down.”</p>
<p id="line_2931">I don’t get it. He even told me that he would never change the schedule of the next volume, so I will start the next volume as soon as I finish this postscript. Oops, the manuscript still has to be revised before that. Proofreaders are really amazing. They search not only for inconsistencies in the current volume, but also for errors in the entire volume set.</p>
<p id="line_2932">However, with so many volumes, it seems that small discrepancies tend to accumulate. It would be easier if it were just a matter of spelling mistakes or rewriting the text to make it easier to understand. In my case, I started writing with only a rough plot, so I did most of the checking only in my head. I realized that I could only get away with that for a short number of books, and reminded myself to refine the plot before I start writing.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2933">And so, here is the 19<sup>th</sup> volume.</p>
<p id="line_2934">The last war has broken out, and the forces are locked in a standoff in various places. I cannot write everything in this volume and will continue to the next volume as a matter of course. This is how I would like to run through the remaining three (planned) books!</p>
<p id="line_2935"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Michael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, who was a candidate for the last boss, has left the scene, and I wonder who will become the last boss. I have a vague idea in my head, but whether it will be adopted or not depends on the future. It is quite common for me to change my direction while writing. I will continue to work hard on the story so that readers can enjoy it more!</p>
<p id="line_2936">I hope that you will continue to support <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2937">See you in the next volume!</p>
