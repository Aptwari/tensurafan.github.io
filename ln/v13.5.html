<h1 class="ch-name">Payday in Tempest</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_19">The Opening festival had come to an end and the prosperous days continued. As part of it, Rigurd was busy throughout the day. Although he was occupied with lots of work, these were all fulfilling and joyful days.</p>
<p id="line_20">And all of this was thanks to Rigurd’s master.</p>
<p id="line_21">The glorious reward from his master—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_22">Thinking back a few years’ time, Rigurd was the elder of the original goblin village. They didn’t have names and were also confronted with the disappearance of the Great Jura Forest’s guardian.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_23">The age of unrest commenced.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_24"><em>We were unfathomably lucky back then</em>.</p>
<p id="line_25">Rigurd couldn’t forget it, deeply grateful in his heart. Had his goblin underlings, under the dire circumstances accidentally done something to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama… If that had been the case, Rigurd and his people would not have been here today.</p>
<p id="line_26">Having said that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> at the time already gave off an immeasurable aura, which dispelled any thoughts they had of attempting an attack on him. Rigurd and his men weren’t planning on doing anything, and now knowing the outcome of it all, that was what saved them.</p>
<p id="line_27"><em>After all, with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s menacing display, we were able to clear out the direwolf threat. That smooth and shining fluid body that shouts aesthetic. Upon laying eyes on him in action, it’s simply stupid to even think about defying him. I bet whoever he may have encountered would also have expressed loyalty to him.</em></p>
<p id="line_28">Rigurd nodded to himself as he recalled the past. There existed such surprising outcomes in life. Rigurd had made a wise choice. However, most people in this world wouldn’t have. If <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had shown up in a different place, it might just have ended up in tragedy. For instance, what if he encountered human adventurers instead? Those who were incapable of seeing the nature of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would probably make the judgement entirely based on the appearance of things. You could expect the encounter to turn violent within a matter of seconds. In other words, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s first encounter with Rigurd was, in a sense, a blessing to both parties.</p>
<p id="line_29">Afterwards, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> accepted Rigurd’s request and became their leader—leading not only the goblins, but the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, orcs, lizardmen, and forest spirits too. Eventually settling down within the forest and becoming the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to command all races.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_30">Rigurd, who’d been reminiscing about the past in the midst of a busy day, was called back to reality.</p>
<p id="line_31">“Oh-oh, there you are. Rigurd-dono, I’ve been looking for you for some time now.”</p>
<p id="line_32">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono? Is there a problem?”</p>
<p id="line_33">“Well, it’s not exactly a problem—”</p>
<p id="line_34"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> paused for a moment.</p>
<p id="line_35">He, a human, had been entrusted by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with the duty of managing the Finance Department of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He had become an irreplaceable member of the country, who also worked very diligently like Rigurd.</p>
<p id="line_36">He responded to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with a smile. Thanks to him, Rigurd was able to resolve his own concerns. He was burdened by self-doubts regarding what he and the rest of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s subordinates meant to him—a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with immense power. Rigurd sighed at his lack of strength, while being subjected to such a powerful existence.</p>
<p id="line_37">Among <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s subordinates, there were many <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who were known for their combat abilities. For instance, the members of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurenai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Benimaru’s corps of soldiers" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> These were strong individuals, far more powerful than Rigurd, who didn’t put shame on the name of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s subordinates.</p>
<p id="line_38">Apart from them, there were the orcs led by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. They were not only pivotal for their specialized role in the city’s development, but also tasked with defending and guarding it.</p>
<p id="line_39">And then, we had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was extremely unusual. There was no doubt that he bore immeasurable strength. It gave Rigurd a cold shiver simply imagining having to fight him as a foe. His loyalty towards <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was unquestionable, yet in reality, there were many who feared <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He was on good terms with Ranga, and also agreed to Rigurd’s requests with a smile… But even with that, anyone would subconsciously be scared in the face of an obviously higher existence compared to oneself.</p>
<p id="line_40">And so, it bore the seed of Rigurd’s concern.</p>
<p id="line_41">Given that, at the moment, there were many powerful <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s who had joined under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s reign, he worried about what he could contribute as one of them. Despite such a thought, Rigurd’s strength was easily above Rank A. It’s not that he was weak, it was simply the others outclassing him to an unreasonable degree. Or in other words, Rigurd was still a rather strong member within Tempest. But He did not realize that and earnestly worked hard every day in order to competently fulfill the role of Goblin King entrusted to him by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_42"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s presence was like a saving grace to Rigurd’s feelings of insecurity. The man who had no concern for strength and even crossed the racial boundary between human and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the head of the Finance Department—Minister of Finance.</p>
<p id="line_43"><em>So that’s the way it’s been all along, then there’s nothing to be worried about. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama has no prerequisite for our strength, moreover, our master is a majestic <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! This just can’t do it; I am still too closed-minded and caused myself such worries. These are just unnecessary concerns. It is simply an instinct for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to judge one another based on strength.</em></p>
<p id="line_44">Rigurd made a wry laugh as he came to that conclusion, quickly abandoning his worries and refocusing on the town’s operations. He was grateful towards <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in his heart for that very reason.</p>
<p id="line_45">His lack of ability compared to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> still passed through his head occasionally, though he had long since treated him more like a friend. That was what gave Rigurd’s tone a sense of intimacy when talking to him.</p>
<p id="line_46">“Well, what seems to be the issue?”</p>
<p id="line_47">“Ay, I’m at a loss and need a second opinion to come up with an answer. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s thrusted another hard task down my throat again.”</p>
<p id="line_48"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> put on an indignant attitude while “complaining,” albeit unable to conceal his joy. Rigurd smiled upon hearing this. It was precisely the hard tasks he complained about that were proof of the trust <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had in him. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would never hand an impossible task to his subordinates, this thus symbolized the expectations <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had placed upon <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_49">“Right now, I’m also busy learning about how the separation of powers works. What comes first now is legislation. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama has ordered me to draft our nation’s constitution.”</p>
<p id="line_50">“Another over-the-top idea, he’s always the same…”</p>
<p id="line_51">Even though <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> acted as the king of the country, he seemed to have no intention of running it. Since if he had participated in politics, all of his free time would’ve been gone. Yet the authority lay not among the citizens, but with the leader, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_52">Tempest—or the Jura-Tempest Federation—was based on an alliance between multiple races. People of different personalities and ideologies all gathering under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s protection is what made Tempest a united nation. Bottom line being, if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was not around, there would be no nation to begin with.</p>
<p id="line_53">Rigurd had nothing to say against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> holding the authority. As such, with hidden thoughts in his heart, he was handed complete political authority.</p>
<p id="line_54">“Based on the current condition, we need to assemble key administration departments and establish a legislation department consisting of a thousand men alongside a judicial department to enforce the laws.”</p>
<p id="line_55">—That was his order. Needless to say, it was an order given after diplomatic discussions with the Western States. But thankfully, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t just let go of all of his responsibilities, he still gave his opinions on the drafts…</p>
<p id="line_56">This was a nasty can of worms he had tossed to Rigurd, who, undaunted, was still happy to follow through with it.</p>
<p id="line_57">“Hahaha, that’s precisely my intent. So, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono, what type of thing are we talking here?”</p>
<p id="line_58">Rigurd, such a nice guy. Even when he was having a hard time himself, he still wouldn’t turn down his friend. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was able to see through Rigurd’s personality within the short time he had spent with him, which was why his following request was tinged with remorse.</p>
<p id="line_59">“Ya… I’m truly sorry for interrupting your busy schedule. I wanted to resolve it myself, but I do want to hear your opinion about this certain thing before making any decisions. Also, this may require the consensus from every department.”</p>
<p id="line_60">“Oh? What do you mean?”</p>
<p id="line_61">“Hmm, as a matter of fact…”</p>
<p id="line_62"><em>I probably shouldn’t trouble Rigurd with this while he’s so busy, </em><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought to himself; but regarding <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s order this time, it was very hard to make the decision himself.

Whenever they desired something, they could simply take it with brute force. That had been their way of life. Another factor was that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> weren’t as careful with and good at managing their money, as opposed to scheming merchants.

<p id="line_72">“If they are unable to utilize their salary, there would be no point in rewarding them.”</p>
<p id="line_73">“That’s precisely the issue. Besides, if they simply save up their money without ever spending it, effectively taking it out of circulation, that may lead to stagnation in the economy. I would want to avoid that from happening.”</p>

<p id="line_76">Rigurd was deep in thought.</p>
<p id="line_77">“Hmm, this sure is a difficult question…” Rigurd whispered to himself. It was also no easy job to consider the amount of payment for respective workloads, but before that, the educational issue had to be resolved first.</p>

<p id="line_96">“Hmm. I’ve considered that point. However, even if we decide to pay in goods, it is time-consuming to learn everyone’s preference. Issuing objects of no significance to the recipient would be meaningless. But it would also be unrealistic to hear everyone’s demands…”</p>
<p id="line_97">Paying in goods removed the concern regarding them hoarding money, but this would be too costly. After all, every citizen already had a minimum welfare.</p>

<p id="line_99">“No, no. You’ve got the wrong idea. Think about it, haven’t we already got a model? Right now, the canteen is using a point system for ordering means, correct? What if we expand the point system for this?”</p>
<p id="line_100">He made his proposal, staring at the two.</p>
<p id="line_101">“Speaking of points, do you mean the “effort point” that grants you access to the special menu?”</p>
<p id="line_102">“If I recall, it is an accumulative point system to represent the work one does. Actually… I see! It’s only a stamp issued by the department head, so it has nothing to do with money.

<p id="line_111">“No, no, it’s really nothing. Rather, what should we prepare for the point exchange? That would be an important question, right?”</p>

<p id="line_192">However, politics were truly troublesome and upsetting to me. I needed only to pose as though I were being thoughtful and nod in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_193">That being the case, it would be sufficient to have subordinates deal with it in my stead. In more ancient times, I acquired Gunther—the king of an opposing force—under my reign. It was definitely the right choice. Gunther had freed me from my duty and built up a system of governance. Even though he would complain at times, all of our accomplishments were dependent on him. And for that alone, my kingdom prospered.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_194">Yet even so, I still got shit from that fucking lizard, Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_195">If I hadn’t met Chloe at the time, there would have been hell to pay. Just thinking about it made me feel appreciation for Chloe beyond words. And of course, for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as well, who was within Chloe. I treated them both as true friends from that point onward. While I may have acted as though there were nothing wrong with the two of them, that wasn’t actually the case. I had some complaints regarding both of them. For instance, their description of events was unspecific, to say the least.</p>
<p id="line_196">“Yeah, there’s about to be a huge earthquake—”</p>
<p id="line_197">So I was warned. But then, it only came in decades’ time.</p>
<p id="line_198">“There’s gonna be an epidemic, please be prepared for it—”</p>
<p id="line_199">Even though that may have been the case, we could only deal with the specifics of the plague after the outbreak began.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_200">And so, so many other countless examples; Chloe’s testimonies were simply too vague. At first, I thought it was unclear due to her memories being blurry. But then I realized: Chloe was doing it on purpose. She had no intention to prevent any disaster from happening.</p>
<p id="line_201">Chloe was a kind person. Yet why would someone as kind as Chloe not try to prevent crises while knowing all about them?</p>
<p id="line_202">My suspicion solidified with every following unnatural result that occurred. Assessing the aftermath of each disaster revealed that the number of casualties was reduced—she disclosed bits of information to me while deliberately hiding key details.</p>
<p id="line_203">So why would Chloe do such things?</p>
<p id="line_204">She claimed to know the future and I believed her when she said this. Perhaps it was because I didn’t question any of her words that I now found myself disgruntled… It should be a friend’s duty, my duty, to be considerate of what she thinks. And that’s when I reached a conclusion.</p>
<p id="line_205">Chloe didn’t wish to change the future. To be more precise, it was to ensure she walked the path she was familiar with, the one she wanted to let happen.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_206"><em>Wouldn’t it be better to at least share her real thoughts with me</em>…</p>
<p id="line_207">That’s what bothered me about her. Despite this, we shared a very close relationship. We had gotten to know each other heart to heart, having spent more than a thousand years together. And above all, it was a real joy for me when she gave that goddamn Veldora a fierce thrashing. Sadly, such wonderful days I lived with her suddenly came to an end.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_208">“As a matter of fact, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I… I may be disappearing soon.”</p>
<p id="line_209">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p id="line_210">“Well, it may be a little exaggerated to say I’m disappearing. It’s more like falling asleep. However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> will still remain for a while, so you could say it’s a personality swap.”</p>
<p id="line_211">“Personality swap…”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_212">I was plunged into turmoil when Chloe broke the news to me out of the blue. This was another one of Chloe’s bad habits. She knew too much herself and always failed to explain things properly because of it.</p>
<p id="line_213">Afterwards, I got to know the details from her.</p>
<p id="line_214">I reached some level of understanding from her after I inquired into future events. It would seem by the time Chloe visited this world, due to the existence of multiple Chloes<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Explained in volume 11, Chloe coming to the world with Leon" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>, the consciousness of the current version would thus disappear. Thereupon <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s personality would take her place.</p>
<p id="line_215">That’s about how it worked. That would be fine, but a problem arose soon thereafter.</p>
<p id="line_216">“So, in another three hundred years, wouldn’t it be time for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s consciousness to disappear?”</p>
<p id="line_217">“Hmm, that would probably be the case.”</p>
<p id="line_218">“I understand. When that time comes, I shall personally seal you up with my power.”</p>
<p id="line_219">Rather than being sentimental about Chloe’s disappearance, what followed had to be carefully considered. It would be fine as long as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> stuck around, but it seemed she would disappear eventually as well. Should that come to pass, I questioned what would happen to the remaining Chloe.</p>
<p id="line_220">According to her speculation, she would undoubtedly lose control. Within Chloe, there apparently dwelled a “broken consciousness,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Chronoa" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, that knew the future. If that consciousness awoke, it would likely take over as the third personality and rain destruction upon the world.</p>
<p id="line_221">That was truly a troublesome issue I got informed of. But I would do what I could for my friend’s sake.</p>
<p id="line_222">I suspected that some important elements had deliberately been tweaked or left out by Chloe and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

It was rumored that they were devastated as a result of Veldora’s resurrection, but that was also questionable.</p>
<p id="line_233">Moreover, the issue at hand was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ascension to the rank of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. In the following Walpurgis Banquet, we were to discuss what to do with the self-proclaimed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_234">Even though it wasn’t foretold to happen in the future, I didn’t try to get on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s bad side. I would’ve been fine with that outcome, but it would’ve been bad if I hurt Chloe’s heart in that way.

On that basis, he deliberately provoked Clayman and led things in his favor, dominating the situation.

<p id="line_236">By the end, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was officially recognized as a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and became a part of the ‘Octagram.’</p>
<p id="line_237">Then that other guy exposed my identity so casually, ruining my plan of passing the title of ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ to Roy.

<p class="space-break" id="line_243">Then—</p>
<p id="line_244">It brought out another gripe I had with Chloe. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> fought and, at last, reconciled as companions—at least according to Chloe, who neither explained why there was a second battle, nor did she ever mention <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gran" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s betrayal.

<p id="line_245">It was beyond me to draw a conclusion from everything that had been going on.

I had some qualms about getting personally involved at the battlefield, but things seemed to have worked out fine.</p>
<p id="line_248">By the way, I got to exact revenge on Veldora. The sight of him crying brought me tremendous joy. He was also different from before—not causing havoc everywhere he went. I was downright surprised seeing it, and even more so, learning that he was actually listening to other people. Now that was a shocker.</p>
<p id="line_249">I’d honestly begun to question my eyes seeing him follow <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s orders like a puppy. Could this be part of the future Chloe foresaw?</p>
<p id="line_250">For every time I grumbled about Veldora, she unfailingly wore a look that expressed a desire to reveal something.

<p id="line_251">Even so, they did give him a solid beat-down when sealing him, presumably allowing her to vent that anger. Either way, the current version of Veldora wasn’t that annoying after all, or so I thought.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_252">Since history unfolded differently from the predictions, it allowed me to become acquainted with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

A bathhouse—it’s where maids fill the tub with water and help me scrub my body, right? Metabolism was unnecessary for my body, so there was no need to bathe. Still, I enjoyed it as a symbol of luxury.</p>
<p id="line_254">At least that was my impression, but what awaited me when we reached the bathhouse defied my expectations entirely. There was a spacious pool, large enough for dozens of people. In fact, the baths were built out of polished stone and hot water was pouring into the pool. I also saw tubs fashioned from aromatic wood and heated rooms where you could warm up in the hot air.</p>
<p id="line_255">“Wh-what is this…”</p>
<p id="line_256">“This, hot spring…? And there is a sauna and everything. That man really does whatever comes to his mind…”</p>
<p id="line_257">I was shocked by the unfamiliar facilities; <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who came along, was surprised in a different sense. The variety of infrastructure all seemed familiar to her, explaining them to me as we bathed.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_258">“I see. So <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has recreated the facilities familiar to him in this world, right?”</p>
<p id="line_259">“That’s what it seems. I’m quite surprised by the facilities on the streets, but they are nothing compared to this. I wonder how much labor and funds were invested to build something this amazing.”</p>
<p id="line_260">“At the end of the day, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is a newly risen <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_263">For the longest time, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> fought vigorously in an effort to improve the standard of living for our people. Although the seeds of her hard work had started to sprout, it would take many more years before any of its fruits were borne. On the other hand, these achievements were so casually displayed in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s country. I couldn’t fault her for it, that surely put a damper on her mood.</p>
<p id="line_264">Anyway, this bathhouse was really nice. I had to admit that.

<p id="line_265">It was a feast for my eyes—her body without a single piece of clothing on it. Her tight waist and alluring, curved hips drew me in. Her luscious pair of breasts proudly presented themselves, giving me the scenery of my life. It was a truly bewitching sight, beautiful as if she were a work of art. Her pale white skin, smooth as newly fallen snow, with a pinch of cherry red. I really had to thank <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> for the creation of this hot spring, for now I was able to justifiably appreciate <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s dazzling form. If I got to spend joyful hours like this, I figured I should build a bathhouse in my country as well—I made up my mind in secret.</p>
<p id="line_266">“Ah, this is heaven.”</p>
<p id="line_267">“Hmm, indeed.”</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_272">After the bath, it was time for a feast.</p>
<p id="line_273">Before my eyes lay dishes I’d never seen before. Also, a new challenge awaited me among them. There were two cylindrical sticks placed near my hands—the utensils known as “chopsticks.” I heard they were used in the east and the Eastern Empire, but it was my first time seeing a pair. In other words, I had no idea how to use them. Actually, I did know how they were used, but I wasn’t confident in my ability to use them properly.</p>
<p id="line_274"><em><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who is perfect in whatever she does, is clueless when using chopsticks</em>—I couldn’t let such rumors spread.</p>
<p id="line_275">Moreover, Veldora was here as well. If I were to mess up in front of him, who knows what type of shenanigans he would pull on me. If he dared to pull a smirking “Pu-hehe” within earshot, I’d blow my lid and start a brawl. In order to prevent such an outburst, I had to overcome the challenge at hand.</p>
<p id="line_276">I was racking my brain for a solution while trying to maintain composure. And then—</p>
<p id="line_277">“Well, let us raise our cups for the courageous battles fought by everyone here, cheers!”</p>
<p id="line_278"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s word set the feast in motion.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_279">There were a variety of steamy, mouthwatering dishes, and a golden drink was poured into my crystal-clear glass. I was something of a gourmet myself, so at a glance, I could tell each dish possessed top-notch quality. In this type of circumstance, proper etiquette was of utmost importance.</p>
<p id="line_280">My social awareness engaged, and I reflexively lifted my glass.</p>
<p id="line_281">Down it went.</p>
<p id="line_282">I Observed the others around me while taking a drink. That should give me time to come up with some great plan—I took a sip and thought it over.</p>
<p id="line_283">“This is really tasty.”</p>
<p id="line_284">Somehow that slipped out of my mouth, but it was undoubtedly my honest opinion. The cooling sensation glid down my throat elegantly. It was a refreshing experience unknown to me, someone who possessed extensive knowledge about wines. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s attending alongside me shared my surprise about this fine wine.</p>
<p id="line_285">“Huu, it’s cold,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> shivered. “Could this be beer?”</p>
<p id="line_286">“It’s all right, I guess,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> responded. “It took me some effort to recreate it and it’s on-par with what I drank in Japan. It’s quite similar, you know.”</p>
<p id="line_287">“Is that so? This may be the first time I’m drinking this, but I don’t find it particularly tasty. Though compared to the beer in this world, I’d definitely drink this over that stuff.”</p>
<p id="line_288"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> expressed her thoughts to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_289">This reminded me, it’s what she said back when <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, an underage student at the time, arrived in this world. I taught her how to drink when she claimed she’d never tried any alcohol.</p>
<p id="line_290">How would a drunk <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> lose her style? I was hoping to see that… But then she dropped the line: “It doesn’t even taste that nice,” and showed no signs of intoxication. Rather than having a tough body, she probably just gained ‘Poison Resistance.’</p>
<p id="line_291">“That’s your lack of experience talking,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> retorted. “I also thought that beer wasn’t all that nice in the beginning. But then I started frequenting a small pub after work… One ought to get a glass of beer after work—I just gradually fell into that mindset.”</p>
<p id="line_292">“Hmm, is that so? I’ve only drunken warm beer around here, and wine tastes sour so I really find them both pretty average.”</p>
<p id="line_293">“That’s because you’ve got a kid’s sense of taste. Okay, I concede that warm beer is bland, but good wines are out there. Like the ones served during Walpurgis, it was surprisingly tasty—”</p>
<p id="line_294">Of course they were; whatever got served there had to be approved by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Hence it would be unthinkable for something not to be exquisite.</p>
<p id="line_295">“Is that so?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked skeptical. “But how would I know if that’s true without tasting it myself?”</p>
<p id="line_296">“I suppose that’s how it works. However, that luxurious stuff won’t come so easily.

<p id="line_297">“You’ve been going on and on about the whole “kid’s tongue” thing from just now, are you looking down on me?”</p>
<p id="line_298">“No, <em>most certainly not</em>, lady.”</p>

Something resembling juice—or so I thought; on second glance I discovered that it actually had a remarkably high alcohol content.</p>
<p id="line_300">“How dare you give me drinks for kids—eh? This is pretty good.”</p>
<p id="line_301">And with clever phrasing, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was able to recommend another drink to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who’d been kept in a loop, got tricked by the sweet flavor and started to get drunk soon enough. Unlike her usual strict self, she showed signs of getting tipsy on her reddening face.</p>
<p id="line_302"><em>Are you a genius?!!</em>—I was deeply shocked by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s strategizing side.

<p id="line_303">Perhaps it was because I had lowered my guard out of respect for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, that I reached out to the dishes in front of me with my bare hands. I completely forgot about the chopstick business and simply grabbed the food with my fingers. I was astonished, immediately turning my attention from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to the dishes. The crispy taste accompanied by a thick and lasting scrumptious flavor that spread throughout my mouth after one bite. <em>Is this what they call Tempura?</em> It was truly tasty for a first try. And they had prepared napkins, so I needed not mind dirtying my fingers.</p>
<p id="line_304">I was satisfied with such a long-overdue dinning of fine food and reached out for my glass. I wanted to try the fruity drink <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> just tasted.</p>
<p id="line_305">Now I saw why it was so tasty. Its aroma was uncanny, a sweetness that spread in your mouth as you took a sip. It became obvious to me they had not spared the use of honey and sugar in making it.</p>

<p id="line_307">“Hmm, then I shall taste it.”</p>
<p id="line_308">“Very well,” she poured some mouthwatering, colorless fluid into it. A fragrance reminiscent of the gifts of the forest filled the air around me. What a unique scent… I swallowed my saliva and carefully maintained my elegant behavior, then passed the glass to my mouth.</p>
<p id="line_309">“This is delicious!”</p>
<p id="line_310">It was neither sweet nor bitter. A pure and elegant taste.</p>
<p id="line_311">“Your kind words are greatly appreciated. There is an abundant supply of it, please help yourself to any amount you desire.”</p>
<p id="line_312">“Hmm, I shall do just that,” I responded with glee.</p>

<p id="line_330">Chloe had already visited this world, and I was able to meet her again during the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Though Chloe didn’t remember me—or I should say, pretended to not know me. Although I couldn’t bear to wait, it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p id="line_331">I really wanted to hug Chloe tight as soon as possible, but that had to wait. Compared to that, a more pressing matter would be the impending judgement day. This was a future that had derailed from its original course.</p>
<p id="line_332">Seeing Veldora being tamed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I couldn’t imagine him going berserk the way he was now. If that were the case, there would probably be disaster of a different kind befalling us. Then I’d have to be cautious with my every move.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_333">I made up my mind on that closing thought. I would keep my promise. And then—truly reunite with Chloe and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I’d call <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as well on that occasion.

<p id="line_334">I’d defy my fate no matter what happened in the near future. Then, I’d put an end to the lonesome days. By that time, it would be my world to reign over. For instance, how about I invite <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Chloe to take a bath together?</p>
<p id="line_335">I dreamed of such day’s arrival.

<p class="space-break" id="line_336">Since I had made a commitment, it came time to rid myself of all the annoying burdens. Wipe out anyone and anything in my way.</p>
<p id="line_337">With such resolve, I looked forward to my future paradise.</p>

<p class="no-indent" id="line_340">There once was a small nation named Silberia. A province state with less than ten thousand inhabitants under the rule of the Eastern Sovereign Alliance of the Nasca Namrium Ulmeria Empire.</p>
<p id="line_341">It had no signature industry, nor special attractions. If there was anything worth mentioning, it would be its peaceful weather unique to the Namrium region and a beautiful lake that lay there.</p>
<p id="line_342">No, there was in fact one other thing. That would be Silberia’s only daughter—Princess Blanche Nam Silberia. Praised as the crown jewel of the kingdom. A princess loved by her people.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_343">This is—the tragic story surrounding Princess Blanche.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Blanche - French for white (feminine form)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span></p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 13.5/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_344">Blanche was a shy yet short-tempered girl. She inherited her mother’s beautiful silver white hair and her red eyes that symbolized Silberia’s royal lineage. She was a cute girl, skin white as snow, with a passion for books, and a late bloomer.</p>
<p id="line_345">On top of that, she possessed magicule none could rival. She perceived things people didn’t normally see, an intrinsic trait of the royal bloodline’s heirs.</p>
<p id="line_346">Even though Blanche was that kind of child, she lived a comfortable life, embraced by the loving care of her mother Letitia. Very few people were aware of this special ability passed down in the royal family, but thankfully everyone within the family knew how to deal with these special kids.</p>
<p id="line_347">“Heed me now, Blanche. You must never tell other people about the things only you can see.”</p>
<p id="line_348">“But why?”</p>
<p id="line_349">“For doing so will only make people fear you. Besides, if those things you see discover they are being watched, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> will appear and eat you!”</p>
<p id="line_350">“NOOOO!!”</p>
<p id="line_351">“It’s all right. Mommy will protect you. So, promise me now, never tell anyone about your secret.”</p>
<p id="line_352">“I understand, mother. I’ll never tell anyone about it.”</p>
<p id="line_353">“Good girl. How cute you are, my Blanc.”</p>
<p id="line_354">Blanche swore from the bottom of her heart while staring into Letitia’s golden pupils. She kept that promise to her mother ever since. And thanks to that, no one was ever scared of her, and she was able to grow up in good care.</p>
<p id="line_355">Although she was rather shy, her uncanny beauty from a young age made her quite popular among the servants. Such was Blanche’s happy childhood, being loved by everyone.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_356">However—</p>
<p id="line_357">Blanche’s happy days were not for long. She had just reached ten years of age; the balance of power within the palace’s harem was toppled. Blanche’s mother, who was the most adored first princess, was in fact from a viscount’s family of lowly origin. The snobbish nobles had conspired to urge the king to marry a second princess.</p>
<p id="line_358">The one who got selected was a woman named Emilia, born from a marquis’ family. While still serving as a concubine, Emilia had already given birth to a daughter to the king. For that very reason she was selected as the new princess. Had it been a son, she would have been on the throne long ago.</p>
<p id="line_359">Emilia, as a high-ranking noble, was keenly aware of the intrigue and conflicts within the harem. She seized control of the palace where Blanche and Letitia resided in little time. Blanche’s nannies as well the maids who cared much for her were all dismissed for fabricated reasons. None had the audacity to defy the second princess, and the servants relegated to the harem no longer obeyed the king, but her. And as a result, Blanche and her mother became neglected.</p>
<p id="line_360">In stark contrast, Blanche’s sister Ashla—who was less than a year younger—received affectionate care as the second young princess. Everything was according to Emilia’s plan.</p>
<p id="line_361">The king had no siblings, granting Blanche the first right of succession. If the second princess, Emilia, were to conceive a prince, he would’ve been guaranteed the throne. Even if that failed, there was still Ashla. And if Blanche ceased to exist, the royal claim would fall into Ashla’s hands, leaving her to be crowned as the next queen of Silberia.</p>
<p id="line_362"><em>For that, I just have to deal with the meddling mother and daughter in my way.</em></p>
<p id="line_363">The ambitious Emilia resorted to far crueler, clandestine tactics in order to advance her blood to the throne.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_364">It was a fateful winter day.</p>
<p id="line_365">On Blanche’s twelfth birthday, her mother the first princess passed away. A blanket of snow cloaked the courtyard. Blanche hid and sobbed alone in a corner no one could see. To Blanche, her father, the king, was a distant figure. And now she had no one left to be called a family. Blanche could only cry, feeling utter despair and sorrow.</p>
<p id="line_366">Suddenly, someone called out to the weeping Blanche.</p>
<p id="line_367">“Why are you crying?”</p>
<p id="line_368">Blanche raised her head to see the source of the voice. It was a breathtaking sight; someone with beauty beyond humans. No, it was a non-human existence that only she could see. However, at the time, it mattered not to her, whether the individual was human or not.</p>
<p id="line_369">“How beautiful…”</p>
<p id="line_370">Blanche opened her heart to the beauty that could drive out anyone’s sadness.</p>
<p id="line_371">She even forgot about her promise to her mother.</p>
<p id="line_372">Such was the incredible impact of this beauty.</p>
<p id="line_373">“Ho, thank you.”</p>
<p id="line_374">Perhaps she had sensed Blanche’s sincerity. A smile emerged on her emotionless face, an extraordinarily destructive smile. A beauty that drove away even the falling snow. Her long hair floated in the wind, a more brilliant white than the snowflakes. Sharing Blanche’s red pupils, a deep scarlet, more vivid than blood. With skin that was an immaculate white, nigh transparent. Her dark dress, as if to obscure this brilliance, concealed her body. An existence beyond human realms. Whoever laid their eyes—be they as special as hers or not—upon this beauty would find that she transcended humans’ very grasp. Such a beautiful female smiled towards Blanche.</p>
<p id="line_375">“My mother passed away.”</p>
<p id="line_376">“Is that so…”</p>
<p id="line_377">“I’ve become an abandoned child. My Father, too, has abandoned me, he cares only for my sister Ash. My life no longer holds meaning.”</p>
<p id="line_378">“It’s nothing like that.”</p>
<p id="line_379">“But…”</p>
<p id="line_380">“At least, <em>I</em> need you.”</p>
<p id="line_381">That sentence was gospel for Blanche. Whatever this non-human’s intentions may have been, it no longer mattered.</p>
<p id="line_382">“Because you can see me. Your white hair, red eyes, are the same as mine. They are gorgeous and will only grow prettier as you thrive.”</p>
<p id="line_383">“Really?”</p>
<p id="line_384">“Indeed.”</p>
<p id="line_385">“Big sister, do you really need me?”</p>
<p id="line_386">“I do.”</p>
<p id="line_387">Her angelic words meant salvation to Blanche. And she continued without pause.</p>
<p id="line_388">“I really like you. And so, I shall grant you any wish you desire. But I would also like you to hear my request.”</p>
<p id="line_389">“It’s all right. If it’s a request from my big sister, I will work hard to make it a reality.”</p>
<p id="line_390"><em>Never conform to the words of non-humans.</em> It was a bit of advice her mother often repeated. But Blanche nodded without hesitation; she had been taken in by this beautiful, kind woman; this non-human that spoke the words she needed the most.</p>
<p id="line_391">Besides, Blanche’s instinct told her to trust the woman.</p>
<p id="line_392">“That’s right, my good child. Then, let me tell you my request. I would wish to borrow your body. I am only spiritually present and desire <em>you</em> as my host.”</p>
<p id="line_393">The non-human existence exhibited no intention of hiding her motives, having elegantly expressed her true desire.</p>
<p id="line_394">This non-human, invisible to human eyes, belonged to the most terrifying existences among all <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> race.

<p id="line_395">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="White Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Blanc.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Blanc - French for white (masculine form)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span></p>
<p id="line_396">Of course, this was no coincidence. This land, Silberia, had been her domain since time immemorial. According to the ancient pact formed with the monarch of this land, it would take dozens of centuries before a vessel of flesh used to accommodate her soul could be born. Until the birth of her ideal vessel, she would protect the land. This was the content of the pact, and the special physique of the royal family was testament to it. The red eyes of the Silberia royal family were her blessing. She upheld the covenant and protected the land.</p>
<p id="line_397">This was the real reason—why Silberia, despite being a province state, was able to retain sovereignty while within the grasp of the Eastern Empire.</p>
<p id="line_398">And the body Blanc was satisfied with—was precisely the young Blanche. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="White Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> always kept her promises. The ancient pact formed with the first queen of this kingdom was kept to that day.</p>
<p id="line_399"><em>When a young girl with silver white hair and red pupils is born, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="White Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Blanc shall take over its body upon fulfilling this girl’s wish</em>.</p>
<p id="line_400">It was a pact upheld for many generations, allowing its effects to compound, presumably to grant her the perfect vessel.</p>
<p id="line_401">And the day of the promise had arrived.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_402">Twelve years of age, in ancient times this was deemed the day one matured to adulthood, and the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="White Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> decided to talk to Blanche. She had deemed her an adult capable of making her own decisions, capable of negotiating with others on equal ground. This was also invoked from the ancient pact.</p>
<p id="line_403">Typical of most <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ personality, they would cunningly induce others to sign one-sided pacts. Yet for someone of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="White Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s stature, there was no need for such trickery. She thought those would only dishonor the pact. Solely through loyally fulfilling a reasonable pact, would the body be her righteous asset.</p>
<p id="line_404">Therefore, she would fulfill any wish made by Blanche, to the best of her abilities. That was why, even if Blanche refused her, she wouldn’t have given up.</p>
<p id="line_405">Human beings were creatures driven by insatiable desire, and there would always come a day they carried a wish. She needed only to be patient and await that day’s arrival. That was why Blanche’s answer came as a surprise <s>for sure, but a welcome one</s>.</p>
<p id="line_406">“Would you…like to be my friend?”</p>
<p id="line_407">“—Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_408">“I’ll give my body to you, big sister. Then please be my friend! W-will you not?”</p>
<p id="line_409">Blanc was taken aback. This was a first for her, even throughout the many eons she had lived. Reflected in Blanche’s eyes was still that beautiful face, yet her heart had been greatly troubled by what just transpired.</p>
<p id="line_410"><em>Did she just say she wants to be friends with me? Okay now what am I supposed to do… Even for someone’s bad joke on their deathbed, this wasn’t funny. Plus, this was something only those with a death wish would ask, yet I don’t really feel pissed about it… And it seems quite interesting, in fact, that girl as well. This girl in front of me may allow me to have some fun. I could spare some time with her since human lives are cheap anyway.</em></p>
<p id="line_411">Despite its subtlety, Blanc flashed a rare look of confusion. But she quickly reached a conclusion in her heart.</p>
<p id="line_412">“Very well. From now on, you and I shall be friends.”</p>
<p id="line_413">Blanche blushed upon hearing this, her crying face lit up with a big smile.</p>
<p id="line_414">“Hee-hee, I’m so happy! Please take care of me in the future, big sister!”</p>
<p id="line_415">“Hmm, I will now latch onto you. Let’s have a good time together.”</p>
<p id="line_416">Then, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="White Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> possessed Blanche’s body. On that day, the fate of the Kingdom of Silberia rested on the young Blanche’s shoulders, yet no one was ever to find out about it.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 13.5/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_417">Blanche grew up to fifteen years of age.</p>
<p id="line_418">Although she still got the cold shoulder within the harem, that being a dark and cold place for her, as soon as she left it behind, the whole palace’s view of her began improving by the day.</p>
<p id="line_419">“Princess Blanche is such a genius. Her elegant actions and attitude are perfect no matter how you see it.”</p>
<p id="line_420">“She’s well versed in history, art, and mathematics. Even geography and sociology. The amount of knowledge she possesses is commendable.”</p>
<p id="line_421">“More importantly, her theory of magic is fantastic! Her analysis of spells does not have a single unnecessary line and she’s able to improve her magical efficiency through simplification of spells. This level of talent is beyond genius, what an outstanding princess!”</p>
<p id="line_422">The royal tutors appointed by the king complemented her unsparingly. And the one most frustrated by this was her sister, Princess Ashla. As they walked past each other in the hallway, Ashla began to pick on Blanche.</p>
<p id="line_423">“My, my, isn’t this my sister dear. Greetings to you. Have you been studying hard today as well? Although that’s important, you’ll be disliked if you don’t go kiss Duke Grunce’s son Lord Guinias’s ass properly, you know?”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_424">The family of Duke Grunce, the famous royal family known since ancient times as the maintainers of Namrium. A noble family, powerful even within the Eastern Empire. Grunce’s domain alone held a population of three hundred thousand. The heir to such nobility from the Empire had been staying around Silberia since a year ago.</p>
<p id="line_425">Guinias Nam Grunce. Age twenty-two, a young man talented in many fields. Guinias had an elder brother who’d been appointed as the next duke. Because of that, it was rumored that Guinias had laid his sights on the throne of Silberia. It was an open secret among the Silberian public, most of who supported such an attempt. There were many reasons for it, the most pertinent one being to maintain friendly relations with the Empire. If the big shot noble became the king of Silberia, they expected less pressure to be exerted on this province state.</p>
<p id="line_426">There was also another reason. Guinias had imported a variety of wares into Silberia by leveraging his connections through Grunce, successfully winning the favor of the kingdom’s nobility with those extremely attractive goods. Those imports were also highly profitable within the kingdom and improved the citizens’ well-being. And for that reason, support for Guinias within the kingdom rose sky-high without any sign of slowing down.</p>
<p id="line_427">That was how Guinias secured his remarkable popularity in Silberia. He was still young and handsome, and already brought great wealth to the nation, so becoming son-in-law of the queen wasn’t far off—that was the opinion of many within the nation.</p>
<p id="line_428">And the one Guinias had laid his eyes on was Princess Blanche, who had been guarding a secret. King Silberia was mindful of the marriage’s significance, only vowing to give his blessing should Guinias strive to help Blanche become the next queen. Guinias swiftly promised his commitment.</p>
<p id="line_429">That meant making Blanche the next queen. Ashla couldn’t stand the idea of Blanche getting crowded, she couldn’t tolerate the thought of her rising to prominence once more. Besides, her mother Emilia had also been outraged by this. She exploited many tactics and invested a great deal of time and effort throughout the years to help her own daughter become the next queen, yet it had all been ruined by the appearance of Guinias. Even the nobles among Emilia’s circle had begun to flatter Guinias. If that were to continue, they would be handing the queen’s throne to Blanche.</p>
<p id="line_430">But there was still a way, as long as she could change Guinias’s heart. Emilia instilled this into Ashla, hoping she would win Lord Guinias’s heart instead. But even if she hadn’t told her so, Ashla shared the same intent. She had gone to great lengths to jeopardize her sister’s relationship with him in order to snatch her fiancé.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_431">This act was also part of her scheme, but Blanche didn’t really mind.</p>
<p id="line_432">“Oh, Ash. Good health to you. I’m glad you are concerned for me. But it’s really nothing. I shall be accompanying Guinias-sama to walk the city later.”</p>
<p id="line_433">“…Is that so. You make me jealous. Very well, I hope you have a pleasant time.”</p>
<p id="line_434">“Hmm. It’s work, after all, one should not indulge their desire for pleasure.”</p>
<p id="line_435">Like that, she was able to dismantle Ashla’s effort to provoke her. Blanche was hardly a young child anymore. She’d been hard at work behind everyone’s back to gain knowledge and power. Nowadays, even those servants couldn’t openly harass her, instead they had to find other subtler ways to do so. Likewise for Ashla, who could merely attempt to provoke her through sarcasm. And for that reason, her hatred for Blanche festered day by day. Yet Blanche seemed unfazed even knowing so.</p>
<p id="line_436">If anything, she seemed to no longer be alone.</p>
<p id="line_437">‹Yes, that’s the way to go. Treat everyone around you as an enemy. However, there’s no need to defeat them all. You need only to differentiate those who can and cannot be manipulated. Hold on to their secrets to force them into serving you. Your sister is but a pawn used by that mother named Emilia. Neither is she useful nor a threat to your presence.›</p>
<p id="line_438">‹I understand, big sis.›</p>
<p id="line_439">She now had a reliable friend named Blanc. That was why she become strong. Her knowledge and magic were all taught by Blanc. Blanche accepted and humbly learned her teachings and had grown dramatically in the past three years.</p>
<p id="line_440">“Huh! Then be cautious when you do have some fun.”</p>
<p id="line_441">“I will, you do that too, Ash.”</p>
<p id="line_442">The two princesses appeared to coexist in harmony, yet the mutual hostility within their hearts burned like wildfire; thankfully, any confrontations dissolved before escalating.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_443">Just like that, Blanche developed day by day, gaining more and more supporters. She’d also been doing quite well with Guinias, at some point they came to represent the ideal couple. The number of people backing Guinias steadily increased with it. The nobles who were still observing the situation also started to step forward in recognizing Blanche as the next queen in line.</p>
<p id="line_444">During this period, Emilia’s intervention attempts became more radical. She scantly cared about decency anymore and resorted to bloodthirsty violence, ordering the assassination of Blanche.</p>
<p id="line_445">However, every attempt amounted to failure. That was to be expected; Blanc within Blanche wouldn’t deign to let mere hitmen harm her.</p>
<p id="line_446">It was smooth sailing. All signs pointed towards her becoming the new queen in due time. The citizenry deemed the increasingly beautiful Blanche as worthy of being their queen. She also gathered the confidence to show a delightful smile to people other than Blanc. That was her sign for having bonded with others, something that Blanc expected from her.</p>
<p id="line_447">But there were still parts which she was dissatisfied with. That would be Blanche’s relationship with Guinias.</p>
<p id="line_448"><em>…This is a real headache. “Romance” is an emotion that begets naught but uncertainty, nothing good whatsoever comes of it. If Blanche’s emotions are to be significantly affected, then I’ll have to confront whatever should follow. God damn hum—</em></p>
<p id="line_449">But, if Blanche could be happy, Blanc didn’t really mind. Even if her partner were a stupid human, she would send them her blessing truthfully. Nothing less could be expected of Blanche’s friend.</p>
<p id="line_450">However—</p>
<p id="line_451">Blanc had a very bad feeling about Guinias.</p>
<p id="line_452">Setting aside incarnation and rebirth into this world, Blanc was currently in an incomplete state. Likewise, her subordinates were only of spiritual existence and had limited impact on the physical world. Despite these circumstances, Blanc would try her best to strategize accordingly.</p>
<p id="line_453">She would later come to find her apprehension manifesting in reality.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 13.5/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_454">‹—That’s the end of the report.›</p>
<p id="line_455">After receiving the reports from her subordinate, Blanc felt a disquieting sense of dread about the situation. She had dispatched scores of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to collect information in Silberia’s capital, surrounding towns, as well as within Grunce’s territory. These, however, revealed some significant issues.</p>
<p id="line_456"><em>Even though I’ve always been on high alert with that man, I couldn’t have expected his comprehensive defense against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. In other words, he has come to this kingdom fully aware of our existence.</em></p>
<p id="line_457">The information collection returned no results ever since Blanche began hanging out with Guinias. Moreover, no useful information at all was collected since, that’s why Blanc had begun to suspect him. Precisely because not a scrap of useful intelligence was collected, it made things far too suspicious.</p>
<p id="line_458">And so, she increased the scope of the search while dispatching her top lieutenants. As a result, she began to uncover Guinias’s real intentions.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_459">—Guinias knew the connection between Silberia and the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="White Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And from that, it was conceivable that he decided to intervene after finding out.</p>
<p id="line_460">—Silver white hair and red pupils. One who possessed both would be the key to the coming of the ancient <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_461">It was no trivial thing to investigate. But if the big shot nobility in the Empire had a hand in this, their way of extracting the truth made such conclusions plausible. In that case, his relationship with Blanche was nothing but a farce as well—</p>
<p id="line_462">“If that’s the case… Unforgivable, absolutely—”</p>
<p id="line_463">Blanc’s face contorted as she gazed at the sky covered in dark clouds. Rather than worrying about the road to her second coming, a project she had planned for eons, being cut off—right now she was simply worried about a friend’s happiness being lost.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_464">A melancholic sigh came out of Blanc’s beautiful, thin lips.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 13.5/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_465">Guinias enjoyed quite the popularity in the capital of Silberia. There were several reasons to explain why, but the most prevalent one was monetary and pragmatic. To establish a new industry, he had considered exploring the mines containing magicule ores. In fact, the Kingdom of Silberia possessed a high concentration of magicule, leading to the ores collected from the mine being of high quality. And Duke Grunce’s territory bought them at a high price.</p>
<p id="line_466">Before his arrival, Silberia was a nation sustained through primary industry such as agriculture, farming, and fishing. Citizens were mostly care-free people that led a self-sustained, simple lifestyle.</p>
<p id="line_467">But now, the seeds of profiteering industries were planted. Alongside those, a number of entertainment industries began to take root. One of the most popular attractions was gambling at horse races. Given the insidious nature of gambling, those who turned rich overnight became obsessed with it.</p>
<p id="line_468">The kind and modest citizens were gradually corrupted, bit by bit. Financial troubles came to grasp the less fortunate, where Guinias astutely lent them his money with a smile. This generosity propelled his support to unseen heights. Other than having a populist foundation, Guinias had executed his preparations in every field. He steadily expanded his influence by welcoming the influx of nobility that attempted to befriend him. He threw out his money by the bucketload in the name of Grunce, the largest noble family in the Empire, and then subsequently recycled the money back into his own pocket. His actions all reflected his immense talents.</p>
<p id="line_469">Everything went according to the master plan.</p>
<p id="line_470">“This is fairly boring, to be honest,” Guinias sneered coldly. “There’s no fun now that everything is running perfectly according to my plan.”</p>
<p id="line_471">“Hahaha, Guinias-sama. Please don’t say so. This type of remote backwater will go nuts over some pitiful fun. It really can’t be helped.”</p>
<p id="line_472">The one complimenting Guinias was one of his aides from the home country. To the public he was nothing more than a minister-type butler who helped Guinias with random chores, given his status.</p>
<p id="line_473">“Huh! Nevertheless, I still couldn’t get my way with the key figure, Blanche. Can’t that woman just accept me already? She always responds to me with some nonsense about keeping her chastity before marriage.”</p>
<p id="line_474">“Well, forget not that she is the princess of a nation. It’s understandable.”</p>
<p id="line_475">“Everything has been moving as planned, except for this woman. She irritates me to no end,” Guinias complained. This was his nature, beneath his facade as a noble heir.</p>
<p id="line_476">“Okay, okay, Guinias-sama. You needn’t keep that unpleasant look. You won’t have to endure for long.”</p>
<p id="line_477">The one responding to him, a measly and cruel looking man, was another trusted subordinate of Guinias, who was in charge of his finances. He had been promised the role of the royal merchant in the land of Duke Grunce upon Guinias becoming a duke. To this end, he only needed to serve Guinias by investing and spreading money to Guinias’s desires.</p>
<p id="line_478">“Ho? Have the preparations been finished?”</p>
<p id="line_479">“Yes. We’ve negotiated with the military and got permission to secretly mobilize the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Armored Corps" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I spent a lot of money buying the gifts for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Calgurio" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Commander of the Armored Corps in the Eastern Empire." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>, but we should be able to assemble sufficient manpower within the estimated time.”</p>
<p id="line_480">“Hahaha, that’s impressive. At last our plan has reached its final stage. My days as a duke are imminent, I await the time with pleasure.”</p>
<p id="line_481">Guinias fantasized about the near future, wearing a despicable grin on his face.</p>
<p id="line_482">Their plan was straightforward. Guinias was to pretend to marry into the royal family by being engaged with Blanche, who had the claim to the throne. But in reality, Guinias was not satisfied with merely being the king of Silberia—his dream was to become the duke of Grunce.</p>
<p id="line_483">His brother had become an eyesore as of late, but that had already been dealt with. If he was to rebel, Guinias already considered disposing of him. But his brother was aware of his younger brother’s nature; knowing their difference in ability, he had already assumed a position within Guinias’s military.</p>
<p id="line_484">Guinias’s future as a duke was set in stone. So, one might ask why he would visit the Kingdom of Silberia in the first place…</p>
<p id="line_485">“Anyhow, Guinias-sama, would Blanche be willing to leave with us as planned?”</p>
<p id="line_486">“Huh. We haven’t slept, but that woman has already fallen for me. I don’t think she will refuse, but just in case, I’ve tipped the military.”</p>
<p id="line_487">“I see. If possible, we should avoid using violence. For some reason, I sense the forthcoming of an unnatural power if we were to invade this land with force.”</p>
<p id="line_488">“Our party agrees to that as well, let’s try to avoid war. Guinias-dono, it would trouble me greatly should this land fall to warfare. Facing such a development, I would need to reevaluate my relationship with you. To me, it would truly be a shame to not be able to maintain our partnership, but I wish to be on good terms with my granddaughter, who is soon to be crowned. If Duke Grunce’s household is to forge an alliance with us, we the subjects of the Kingdom of Silberia could live long and prosper as well.”</p>
<p id="line_489">The one pandering was Emilia’s father, Marquis Barnes. He had collected intelligence himself, anticipating his ruthless daughter lunging towards more violent actions. And through his instinct as a nobleman, he discerned that Guinias’s end-goal was never the throne of this kingdom. Barnes then took a gamble in order to make his granddaughter the queen, and approached Guinias, inquiring his true intent.</p>
<p id="line_490">In the end, Barnes was accepted by Guinias and thus expressed his true thoughts. Guinias wanted to bring Blanche to his home country, and Barnes saw Blanche as a burden, best to be evicted from Silberia. Bound by a mutual goal, they decided to form an alliance. And it was for that reason that Barnes wholeheartedly wished to avoid any conflict with the Empire.</p>
<p id="line_491">“Then, Marquis Barnes, would you be able to keep this country’s nobles under control?”</p>
<p id="line_492">“Of course. Even if the king or Princess Blanche herself object, most of the nobles are on Guinias-sama’s side,” Barnes carefully responded to the young and not-yet-Duke Guinias. This was, indeed, a reflection of the overwhelming difference in power between big and small nations. Barnes had to force a smile for the sake of his granddaughter, as well as his own authority, even if it repulsed him. In spite Guinias already having seen through Barnes’s act, he kept on smiling as if unaware.</p>
<p id="line_493">“Very well, then when shall we execute the plan?”</p>
<p id="line_494">To Guinias, who wished to return home as soon as possible, the sooner, the better. However, he had endured for so long and cautiously planned his every step, so it would have been unwise to rush and mess up in the end. To ensure the success of the plan, the date of execution was extremely crucial.</p>
<p id="line_495">“Let’s see…”</p>
<p id="line_496">“It would only take a few days to surround the area completely with the formation of the army.”</p>
<p id="line_497">“The next festival of sacrifice at the palace, which happens to be Princess Blanche’s sixteenth birthday. In our country, one officially enters adulthood upon that age, it would be an appropriate time to make a proposal. Besides, most of the nobility would gather on that day, wouldn’t that <em>precisely</em> be the best timing?”</p>
<p id="line_498">“Huhuhu, as expected of Marquis Barnes. When did you find out that I planned on that day from the start?”</p>
<p id="line_499">“Hahaha, it’s just a coincidence.”</p>
<p id="line_500">“Very well, we’ll settle for a coincidence. Then our plan shall be set in motion on the next day of sacrifice. Any disagreement?”</p>
<p id="line_501">“No!”</p>
<p id="line_502">“Understood.”</p>
<p id="line_503">“As you wish.”</p>
<p id="line_504">With the approval of the other three men, the day of battle had been settled.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_505">Later once Barnes was the first to leave, only men of the Empire remained in the room.</p>
<p id="line_506">“Speaking of him, what an idiotic man. But he’s clever, you know, even as a noble he’s good at his stuff.”</p>
<p id="line_507">“As you’ve said, he just let go of Princess Blanche, their national treasure. Completely unaware that whoever were next to inherit the throne would be meaningless.”</p>
<p id="line_508">“The bloody red eyes are a sign of the curse. That silver white hair surely makes people think of that horrifying and damning ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ I’m impressed that despite every characteristic matching, the idiot nobles of this country are oblivious.”</p>
<p id="line_509">“The Empire has been pushing behind the scenes to make them realize as well. To prevent that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> from coming to this world,” Guinias said with a calm and focused expression.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_510">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> within this land truly was an eyesore to the Empire.

<p id="line_511">Yet the White Queen was really something else. There was no way one could sit and negotiate with her on equal terms. However, the one who broke that common sense was the first ancient monarch of Silberia.</p>
<p id="line_512">“It traces back to around 3000 years ago, and it’s no simple matter to pass on the correct historical narrative. But this irresponsibility on their part for not caring about their own national emergency is astounding.”</p>
<p id="line_513">Early rulers of Silberia formed a covenant with the master of many <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="White Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Blanc. Its content being to facilitate the coming of Blanc to this realm, and in return, she would be the guardian of the Kingdom of Silberia. Testament to the pact were the ‘Crimson Eyes’ that could see through anything, a power only possessed by the king’s lineage. With the purpose of inheriting a cursed bloodline and amassing magicule throughout generations. And then, when the heir with the ideal flesh for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> appears, it shall possess it and come forth to this world once more.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_514">The Empire exhausted its means of espionage to explore the contents of this secret pact. They had long been preparing in order to be ahead of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_515">“So, Guinias-sama. What would you do with princess Blanche? Are you really going to marry her?”</p>
<p id="line_516">“Don’t be stupid. Even if I decide to play around with her for a couple of years, I would get in serious trouble if she got pregnant. Before that happens, she will just have to die.”</p>
<p id="line_517">“That’s reassuring to hear. If it were me, I wouldn’t want to have that type of woman with demonic character as my master.”</p>
<p id="line_518">“Hahaha, it’s a shame, really. But we have to destroy the bloodline in its entirety.”</p>
<p id="line_519">“Of course, I understand that. As soon as we end the king’s lineage, even the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> will be powerless.

That has been of great help to us…”</p>
<p id="line_520">“Regardless, we should be able to cut off the royal bloodline completely.”</p>
<p id="line_521">“Then, about Princess Ashla—?”</p>
<p id="line_522">“I wouldn’t ask that, it’s for your own good.”</p>
<p id="line_523">“Hahaha, sorry for the intrusion. But I haven’t asked anything yet.”</p>
<p id="line_524">“You shouldn’t have spoken of it in the first place.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_525">Then, they continued their plotting.</p>
<p id="line_526">Without noticing that a small bug had secretly concealed itself on the corner of the window…</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 13.5/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_527">The sixteenth birthday of Blanche. That day would mark the beginning of the “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lakeshore Dyed Scarlet" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Incident”—</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_528">Blanche was filled with regret.</p>
<p id="line_529">She had already heard of Blanc’s advice, yet she smiled and said it was fine, failing to assess her circumstance.</p>
<p id="line_530">“You will go with me, right, Blanche?”</p>
<p id="line_531">“But, Guinias-sama, I must follow my father’s will. Just a little bit more would do, it is my duty to improve this country. Haven’t you also sworn to support me?”</p>
<p id="line_532">“I hope you reconsider, Blanche. I, too, approve of your devotion to this kingdom. When you arrive at my country, we will continue to assist you in contributing to the Kingdom of Silberia in terms of economic and cultural exchange. There will be countless things we can do. I’ll respect your decisions. Now what do you think?”</p>
<p id="line_533">“But…”</p>
<p id="line_534">For the past day, Blanche’s head had been filled with the idea that Guinias would support her becoming queen one day. He had always gone to tell those nobles supporting her that the throne was exclusively for her.</p>
<p id="line_535">In the ancient past, Blanc extended a helping hand to the people suffering from poverty in the form of a pact. In order to fulfill the vow with Blanc, this country needed to bear a real queen. At last, this country had gained what it needed—she believed this would also have been what everyone hoped for.</p>
<p id="line_536">Blanche was puzzled.</p>
<p id="line_537">Guinias’s proposal was to bring her to the Empire, and that was something unacceptable to her. Yet he hadn’t mentioned it until then. The tumultuous situation could’ve even plunged Blanc into chaos. Moreover, all nobles present at the gathering approved of Guinias’s proposal. This was a particularly deep betrayal towards Blanche.</p>
<p id="line_538"><em>How can this be… I thought I was the one everyone needed?</em></p>
<p id="line_539">The sharp disruption dropped a layer of despair upon Blanche’s heart.</p>
<p id="line_540">“No! I will not allow you to take Blanche abroad!!”</p>
<p id="line_541">Suddenly, Blanche’s father—the king—shouted. The king, who worked his heart and soul for the country all his life, who was always calm and quiet, now stared at Guinias with burning rage in his eyes.</p>
<p id="line_542">“You bastard, have you been plotting to take Blanche abroad from the start? Your actions have tarnished the Empire.”</p>
<p id="line_543">“My, whatever are you talking about? This matter is nothing but beneficial for both kingdoms.”</p>
<p id="line_544">“Absurdity! Th-this country, since ancient times has been—”</p>
<p id="line_545">“I can’t believe that Your Majesty would still believe those stale superstitions, for if that’s true, you’ll be a laughingstock before your guests,” Guinias retorted with a scornful tone, as if trying to mock the king. The nobles joined in with laughter; they ostensibly held loyalty to the king but had long committed treachery. Guinias had prepared everything for it as well, just for this day. The celebration of Blanche’s sixteenth birthday was no more.</p>
<p id="line_546">“Y-you whoreson…sabotaged my country’s politics…”</p>
<p id="line_547">“Your Majesty, you are too nice of a person. Were you so naive as to believe that those around you would never betray you, and that the people of this country were loyal is if bonded by blood? I’m sorry to inform you that these were all mere fantasies. We humans will resort to anything for the sake of our own interests. If we get to keep our life, money, and a bright future safe and sound in our pocket, we wouldn’t even flinch to betray our nation.”</p>
<p id="line_548">“Don’t try to fool us! I’ve distinguished you as a traitor. But the people of my country are earnest in wishing for Blanche to become their queen.”</p>
<p id="line_549">“Aha, I’m rather skeptical about that. Your Majesty, I suggest you understand your circumstance better. I would be uneasy about the future if my father in law kept acting this way.”</p>
<p id="line_550">“WHAT?!”</p>
<p id="line_551">“I’ll give you three days’ time. Before the deadline, please hand over Princess Blanche.”</p>
<p id="line_552">“Wait! Did you honestly think I would—”</p>
<p id="line_553">“Your Majesty, you should yield to Guinias-dono’s proposal. Should we let Princess Blanche marry Guinias-dono, our connections with the Empire would certainly become closer. If you truly want someone to be the queen, my granddaughter is still around.”</p>
<p id="line_554">“That’s right, father. If you choose me, I’ll definitely be a better queen than my sister.”</p>
<p id="line_555">Marquis Barnes interrupted, followed by Princess Ashla, their voices drowning out the king. These were supposed to be unforgiveable, vile acts punishable to the highest degree. Yet, none of the nobles intervened, not even the minority who still held a sense of conscience, as they were forced into silence under the intense stares of the nobles supporting the Barnes family.</p>
<p id="line_556">The king came to terms with his plight, his face distorting with regret. Facing the king at such dismay, Guinias calmly stated with a victorious tone:</p>
<p id="line_557">“About what we just discussed, about what the people truly want—you should know the answer with tomorrow’s morning paper. You might as well read it before you answer anything. Please do contemplate what the right decision for this nation truly is. I shall await your response.”</p>
<p id="line_558">Guinias had done his part. He then left the scorned king with those words. He departed from the celebration hall, and many nobles did as well, as if following him. The ones who remained in the venue were the king, Blanche, and a handful of nobles.</p>
<p id="line_559">“How can this… Are those people ignorant of our situation?”</p>
<p id="line_560">“If-if this is to continue, our kingdom will fall into ruin…”</p>
<p id="line_561">The king and the nobles sighed, to an onlooker they resembled lost souls…</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_562">The morning of the next day.</p>
<p id="line_563">Hidden away in the most secure chamber within the king’s castle, those who remained at the celebration hall gathered. Before them lay the country’s morning newspaper, its content distressing everyone present. The cover page was filled with celebratory headlines.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_564"><em>The great nobleman Guinias has come to marry Princess Blanche. They are at this time already engaged, before long she will become his wife and forge a proper marriage.</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_565">The newspaper declared it as such.</p>
<p id="line_566">“It’s all over. My holy goddess, what an unforgivable betrayal—“ the king collapsed on his chair with a whimper.</p>
<p id="line_567">“Father!”</p>
<p id="line_568">“I’m sorry, Blanche. If only I had told you—forgive me.”</p>
<p id="line_569">“No-no, there’s no such thing! Father has done nothing wrong. It is I who’s been too immature.”</p>
<p id="line_570">“What are you talking about. You may be sixteen now, but you are still a child. You are still so young, yet such hardship…”</p>
<p id="line_571">“That’s absurd! It is I who fell for Guinias-sama—”</p>
<p id="line_572">“Enough…that’s enough. We should consider the near future instead.”</p>
<p id="line_573">Everyone began to express their views on that line of thought. The prime minister spoke first:</p>
<p id="line_574">“The people believe the news that has been printed. There’s no doubt to them that princess-sama is getting married. They all feel that the country has developed to become affluent, and their blind confidence has numbed their ability to doubt.”</p>
<p id="line_575">The court mage commander said:</p>
<p id="line_576">“Your Majesty, from last night’s investigation, our country has been surrounded by the Imperial military. They’ve already drawn our people to their side, they could fabricate reasons to start a war at this point. Rightful justification in the public eye…would probably lie with the Empire.”</p>
<p id="line_577">The Army Chief followed up:</p>
<p id="line_578">“Allow me to be blunt here, we won’t stand a chance with the current strength of our army. Moreover, there may be soldiers in favor of the Empire within our ranks, who could announce that we’ve been surrounded, even before battle breaks out.”</p>
<p id="line_579">The situation was desperate.</p>
<p id="line_580">But they couldn’t meekly obey the Empire like a dog.</p>
<p id="line_581">“We will not bow to the Empire. Should we do such a thing, we would be betraying our ancient pact. There will be travesties far, far more tragic and horrifying than destruction at the hands of the Empire.”</p>
<p id="line_582">“Indeed, my king! Our god is a terrifying existence. If we were to disavow our promise, we would warrant punishment worse than death.”</p>
<p id="line_583">“I can’t believe that the number of nobles who have forgotten about this has increased to such magnitude. How pathetic.”</p>
<p id="line_584">“We shall fight, even if to no avail. Perhaps God will show mercy in light of our sincerity.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_585">The Kingdom of Silberia—a kingdom bonded by an ancient pact. If they were to disavow the deal with God—with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—what awaited them ahead would be torment far more terrifying than the demise of their flesh. It was because they knew this all too well, that they could not succumb to the Empire’s demands.</p>
<p id="line_586">Even if the country were destroyed…</p>
<p id="line_587">“How about w-we summon our god…our god. Then, we shall unite and face our demise,” the court mage commander said solemnly.</p>
<p id="line_588">Everyone nodded.</p>
<p id="line_589">There may still be time before the final verdict—</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_590">Blanche couldn’t hear what her father and the rest were saying, only despair and sadness burst into her heart.</p>
<p id="line_591">“This is all my fault… It’s all because I didn’t listen to Blanc’s advice…”</p>
<p id="line_592">“No, Blanche. It is because my strength has yet to be fully developed. You shouldn’t feel bad about it.”</p>
<p id="line_593">“No, that’s not true! Maybe it’s because…because I wished to be your friend.”</p>
<p id="line_594">“Calm down, Blanche—”</p>
<p id="line_595">“I’m sorry Blanc. I’m not needed by anyone after all. Whether it be Guinias-sama or the people of this country.”</p>
<p id="line_596">“I-I need you…”</p>
<p id="line_597">“Thank you. Truly, thank you for everything you’ve done, Blanc—”</p>
<p id="line_598">“Blanche, what are you—”</p>
<p id="line_599">This may have been the first time Blanc had panicked since her birth.</p>
<p id="line_600">“It is because of my promise to you, that Blanc’s power has been limited, right? I truly thank you for keeping your end of the bargain with this country.”</p>
<p id="line_601">“Stop it, Blanche! This is just a pact. I don’t care anymore. To me, what’s important is—”</p>
<p id="line_602">“Thank you, and I apologize. I’m not as strong as you. But I’m still happy about one thing. You are willing to use my body, for that I am satisfied. So, Blanc, live your life freely from now on—”</p>
<p id="line_603">Then, Blanche’s “soul” executed the pact, based on which she would transfer her body to Blanc. Her shining, colorful soul fell into Blanc’s hand.</p>
<p id="line_604">“Ah…ah… Blanche, so gentle and kind…my Blanche. I love you. I love you the most. My first ever friend. I couldn’t protect you, who were so gentle and kind; oh, how powerless I am—”</p>
<p id="line_605">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="White Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—Queen of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, symbol of power—now trembled and lamented her powerlessness. Perhaps this was a sight that no one who knew her would ever believe. There was no audience, yet this was the reality.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_606">Blanc obtained Blanche’s flesh without the king’s witness.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 13.5/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_607">The court mage commander responded first among the group discussing the plans for the future.</p>
<p id="line_608">“God, I’ve heard the voice of God?!” he shouted and extended both of his hands to Blanche, sitting quietly alone. Then he poured all of his magic into a magical circle on the ground, initiating the ritual to summon the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_609">“W-what are you doin—”</p>
<p id="line_610">What followed was faster than the sentence the king couldn’t finish.</p>
<p id="line_611">“Greetings Gentlemen.”</p>
<p id="line_612">Blanche stood up.</p>
<p id="line_613">No. This was no longer Blanche. This was the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="White Primordial" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the body of Blanche.</p>
<p id="line_614">Everyone present knew exactly what had occurred and fell to their knees on the spot. Among them, only the king remained standing and asked.</p>
<p id="line_615">“G-God! Why…now? Your pact with Blanche should still…”</p>
<p id="line_616">“Unfortunately, this pact has just been invoked.”</p>
<p id="line_617">“No, this can’t be possible! My daughter, Blanche confided in me that you would protect her—!!”</p>
<p id="line_618">“You are…rather noisy, please quiet down.”</p>
<p id="line_619">Blanc’s words shut the king up. But he couldn’t hide his anger, thinking that Blanc broke the pact. That didn’t last for long.</p>
<p id="line_620">The king’s anger dispersed in the face of an immense, bottomless fury. The source of which, needless to say—belonged to Blanc.</p>
<p id="line_621">“It is because you stupid humans took away my pleasure. Don’t you all agree this is a grave crime to be punished for?”</p>
<p id="line_622">The king froze out of fear. For only he sensed Blanc’s fury.</p>
<p id="line_623">“I-If God wishes so—”</p>
<p id="line_624">Even though that answer was just one line, it exhausted him completely. Then, the debilitated king crumbled back into his chair.</p>
<p id="line_625">“Good boy. Since you’ve kept true to your pact with me, I shall grant you all a painless death, however—”</p>
<p id="line_626">What of those who broke the covenant?</p>
<p id="line_627">No one dared to ask about their consequences. Then—</p>
<p id="line_628">Everyone present was blessed. They now walked the path under their god’s command, their hearts in bliss, to be relieved from ever learning the tragedy that was about to take place.</p>
<p id="line_629">“Very well, let us feast.”</p>
<p id="line_630">As Blanc commanded, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> quickly possessed all of the bodies at the scene. The tragedy now unveiled…</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_631">Blanc, clouded by fury, cast out the forbidden magic. A spell to grant peaceful death to those who kept true to the pact and bestow endless torment to the traitors. It caused one to bleed to death from the inside out, the demise of this nation being seared into their eyes.</p>
<p id="line_632">The effect of that curse covered her entire domain, no living being could escape her grasp. But this was hardly enough to abate Blanc’s wrath.</p>
<p id="line_633">“Bring those cretins before me.”</p>
<p id="line_634">In that moment, not a single suggestion from her subordinates could’ve gotten through to her, even her ancient trusted aides—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the duke class—would’ve been sent to the guillotine, should they have caught her ire.</p>
<p id="line_635">“ “ “Understood!” ” ”</p>
<p id="line_636">Following the word, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> scattered, returning after a few short minutes.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_637">“Who do you think I am! Show yourself, bastard!”</p>
<p id="line_638">The first, arrogant, non-sense spitting fool had been brought before her.</p>
<p id="line_639">“Oh my, Marquis Barnes, so you are the first.”</p>
<p id="line_640">“A-are you Blanche?! Why are you sitting there?! That belongs to His Majesty alone, that is the majestic throne!”</p>
<p id="line_641">“You are really noisy, you know? That’s some annoying barking coming from a petit nobody.”</p>
<p id="line_642">“W-what did you say? How dare you say that to me, you-you are just a little girl—ah…?!”</p>
<p id="line_643">Barnes, as arrogantly as ever, looked into Blanc’s eyes and felt a sensation of ice-cold water being poured onto his heart and the biting frost climbed down his back. With a broken spirit he was reduced to observing his surroundings. He stood where all the losers were supposed to be, yet not a single soul remained. The figures of losers who could only lament their defeat through the scheme of Guinias. The only person in front of him was Blanc.</p>
<p id="line_644">“Blanche…is no more. Try to use your remaining few brain cells to try to understand me now.”</p>
<p id="line_645">Only hearing that did Barnes begin to notice how strange Blanc looked. Blanche had always been a pretty girl, but the one in front of him couldn’t simply be described as beautiful. Her hair, whiter than snow, decorated the throne whilst she spitefully gazed down at Barnes with her crimson eyes. The gaps between her dark dress vaguely flashed her smooth white skin. Its seductive gleam could instill lust, yet before all else, it showed them fear. It was the type of beauty beyond human comprehension.</p>
<p id="line_646">Barnes became speechless having guessed her true identity.</p>
<p id="line_647">“C-could it be…”</p>
<p id="line_648">“Settle down, now. Soon I’ll invite your family and friends here too, let us have a celebration.”</p>
<p id="line_649">Marquis Barnes had no right to refuse. Before he could say a thing, he was shackled in front of the throne. Then, another couple minutes passed.</p>
<p id="line_650">“Slow down this instant! Who do you think I am!!”</p>
<p id="line_651">A woman shrieked words akin to Barnes’s.</p>
<p id="line_652">“What are you doing! Are you knowingly offending the next queen?!”</p>
<p id="line_653">The other was a foolish young girl radiating an arrogant attitude without even knowing what she had gotten herself into. The two of them were brought before Blanc.</p>
<p id="line_654">“I guess it runs in the genes. Perhaps it will help all of you reflect on yourselves if this girl sheds a little blood.”</p>
<p id="line_655">She may have been the heir to the king’s blood, yet she held no significance to Blanc. Ostensibly forgetting about that, she glanced over the two who had been brought in front of her.</p>
<p id="line_656">“Blanche… What are you doing here!”</p>
<p id="line_657">“Sister, please understand you position. Wife of the Imperial nobleman is just an empty title. Do you understand that you are a mere lamb waiting to be slaughtered without anyone to back you?”</p>
<p id="line_658">People unable to comprehend their circumstances tried to argue against Blanc. But that folly was devoured by a fiery blaze once Blanc’s eyes focused on her.</p>
<p id="line_659">“I-I fee-feel horrible! Ca-can’t brea—!”</p>
<p id="line_660">“KYAA! I-it burns! MY FACE, MY SKIN IS BURNING!”</p>
<p id="line_661">“What an unpleasant sight. I will not let you off the hook that easily for bullying my friend all these years.”</p>
<p id="line_662">Hearing that cold and emotionless voice, it struck Emilia and Ashla that he one before them was not Blanche. By that time, it was already far too late. But, even if they had understood any earlier, Blanc would not have forgiven them anyway.</p>
<p id="line_663">“You two should wait here for our final guest to show up,” Blanc said without even dignifying the wretched women with a glance.</p>
<p id="line_664">The last one—the man with the most sins. Only the hatred towards him burned quietly deep-within Blanc’s eyes.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 13.5/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_665">Guinias was satisfied with how everything went according to his wishes and merrily drank the day away. Thanks to teleportation magic, his body was not exhausted despite having traveled to such a remote nation. Or rather, he was quite energetic, having fully immersed in the joy of last night’s victory.</p>
<p id="line_666">“This was a triumph. Now all that’s left is to get Princess Blanche out here.”</p>
<p id="line_667">“If we are rejected, we’ll just have to force her away with the military.”</p>
<p id="line_668">“Hmm, the people are on our side as well. But you’ve got to make it clear to the military to avoid damaging the surroundings.”</p>
<p id="line_669">“Of course. This land will soon be in Guinias-sama’s pocket. So be cautious not to harm any civilians.”</p>
<p id="line_670">“I’ll let you handle that,” Guinias laughed in high spirits. But his mirthful moment was suddenly interrupted when intruders burst inside.</p>
<p id="line_671">“You’ve been summoned by our queen, please come forth with us.”</p>
<p id="line_672">“Resistance is futile, we’ve already eliminated anyone in our path.”</p>
<p id="line_673">The two who showed up were the embodiments of inhuman strength.</p>
<p id="line_674">“What the hell are the guards doing?!” Guinias shouted, despite which, not a single one came to his room. The smaller<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Yes, it’s Moss." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> of the two interlopers mockingly smirked at the panicked Guinias and said: “Didn’t I say, we’ve taken care of the ones that looked like they’d get in our way?”</p>
<p id="line_675">The innocent voice delivered a vicious line. This made Guinias’s aides realize those two were no ordinary beings.</p>
<p id="line_676">“Then, let’s go.”</p>
<p id="line_677">“That’s right, farewell then, bye-bye!”</p>
<p id="line_678">The two only took Guinias away as they loyally carried out their master’s order. The people remaining began to panic and shout.</p>
<p id="line_679">“Those are <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> have come to stop us!”</p>
<p id="line_680">“Go inform the military! Guinias-sama has been kidnapped!”</p>
<p id="line_681">“Th-that is probably—”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_682">The message was swiftly relayed to the military camp. Guinias-sama was kidnapped despite a highly secured premise. The two criminals, their true identities likely being…<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="archdemon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. Those unprecedented reports plunged the military base into pandemonium. What immediately followed—the operation was urgently revised to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> hunting.</p>
<p id="line_683">On the other side, Guinias unwillingly had the pleasure to experience demonic air travel. At first, he was still resisting, the young nobleman acquired combat skill equivalent to Rank B adventurers and was acclaimed for his excellence in both brass and brain. In fact, having reached Rank B, one could at least become a lieutenant officer within the army—quite the talent in others’ eyes. Because of that, he had been rather naive in thinking he would be able to beat a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or two.</p>
<p id="line_684">His preconceptions were easily crushed. These two <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were able to rush in and kidnap him from the military base filled with sharp soldiers and a strictly secured perimeter. Their incredible strength spoke for itself.</p>
<p id="line_685">“You bastards, what are you going to do to me?”</p>
<p id="line_686">“Look below.”</p>
<p id="line_687">Guinias looked down and witnessed scenes straight from Hell. Their faces torn, twisted with agony, blood flowing out of their body without end. They writhed in pain—people, people everywhere. The once tidy streets were tainted with blood, while fresh blood kept gushing into the lake. It was dyeing the lake scarlet.</p>
<p id="line_688">“WHAT?!”</p>
<p id="line_689">Guinias was speechless at the sight, but he soon regained clarity and howled: “You damn <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>! You bastards, you should never have existed in this world! The people living on this land have signed a contract with your master. But you… How dare you just sacrifice them like this?!”</p>
<p id="line_690">Hearing it, the small <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> shook its head.</p>
<p id="line_691">“That’s not the case. It’s all because of your actions.”</p>
<p id="line_692">“Caused by my actions?”</p>
<p id="line_693">“Yeah. You. You taught them to be like this. It was <em>you</em> who seduced and betrayed our master’s ally, Blanche-sama, and attempted to exile her from the country.”</p>
<p id="line_694">“T-that’s…”</p>
<p id="line_695">“We don’t want traitors, nor do we want collaborators who failed to prevent the betrayal. They both carry equal sin.”</p>
<p id="line_696">“Wait a moment! What about children? Shouldn’t there also be innocent infants? Are you just gonna kill them all?!”</p>
<p id="line_697">“So what?”</p>
<p id="line_698">“What gives you the illusion of righteousness?”</p>
<p id="line_699">“Didn’t I just say that your sins are collective? But our master has shown mercy this time. She even granted those free of sin a painless death.”</p>
<p id="line_700">“That was really surprising. If she were anything like before, exemptions would’ve been unthinkable. I suppose it’s all by virtue of Blanche-sama. That Blanche-sama also died because of you. Meaning, all of these tragedies are of <em>your</em> doing; look below and have its sight burned into your heart.”</p>
<p id="line_701">Guinias felt confused being told so. At heart, he was not a man of pure evil. He’d contracted all the self-serving habits of a noble, and it was his sincere conviction that a noble was nothing without their people. First improve citizens’ standard of living, entrap their support through entertainment, then milk them through taxation and their labor. Because those were his previously held beliefs, his heart began to shake upon seeing so many people being slaughtered below him.</p>
<p id="line_702"><em>I-I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m not wrong!</em></p>
<p id="line_703">He told himself that, trying to steady his mind. But then, he could no longer keep his composure after hearing the next line coming out of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_704">“It’s tragic indeed that the residents are involved as well. But rest assured that you are the one who caused all of this, you ain’t gonna be let off the hook with just this amount of suffering. So, don’t lose your nerve just yet, brace yourself now for what’s next to come.”</p>
<p id="line_705">Guinias came to terms with his reality as the horrifying realization finally settled in.</p>
<p id="line_706">“No, no,” Guinias cried out. “Someone save me, please let me go!”</p>
<p id="line_707">“Sorry, but we can’t help you with that. We’ll get killed for it,” answered the small <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, disgust on its face, to which the other agreed.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_708">Then, Guinias was dragged in front of the queen. His ego shattered along with his inner self. He was a shell of his former glory.</p>
<p id="line_709">“Ara ara, what happened to Prince Charming? Why are you crying so much? Have you pissed yourself too?”</p>
<p id="line_710">“Someone save me, I’m begging you, please spare me,” Guinias wailed while sobbing like a bitch. Hearing this, Blanc’s laughter echoed with joy. Alas, the fire of hatred in her eyes only grew in ferocity.</p>
<p id="line_711">“Idiot, why would I ever spare you now? But you <em>are</em> pretty lucky.”</p>
<p id="line_712">“Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_713">Guinias regained some hope hearing Blanc’s words and raised his head. What met him was a sinister smile.</p>
<p id="line_714">“At least you are not the only one getting punished. You won’t feel lonely that way.”</p>
<p id="line_715">In front of Blanc lay Guinias’s companions’ figures, their faces filled with fear and agony, and their bodies ugly, distorted, and rotten. They’d been stripped of all clothing; their dignity as high nobility was a thing of the past.</p>

<p id="line_717">“That won’t do. Farewell then, fool. You will yearn for death as you enjoy the curse that grants eternal suffering.”</p>
<p id="line_718">Guinias heard that annoying yet beautiful voice.</p>

<p id="line_720">Guinias left the world with a loud scream before his consciousness was consumed by terror and agony—what followed was a hellish inferno beyond words.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_721">Afterwards, the Imperial army that rushed into Silberia were terrified by the mere sight of the calamity. Fierce battles against the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demons" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> broke out.

<p id="line_722">By the time they arrived, she had completed her revenge and was filled with desolation. She had no motivation to fight whatsoever.</p>
<p id="line_723"><em>I feel so empty. Blanche is not around, nor her country as my playground. I suppose I don’t have any further reason to stick around these lands…</em></p>
<p id="line_724">Blanc sparred with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Imperial Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s while thinking that.</p>

<p id="line_726">She had little interest in fighting the menacing knights.</p>
<p id="line_727"><em>What a mess. I could easily win but don’t want to risk hurting Blanche’s body. I should just retreat to let the children of this land have a good sleep.</em></p>
<p id="line_728">Blanc ceased fighting early on. It was the saving grace for the knights that had confronted her. They were among the most elite military force within the Empire, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Imperial Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Order. However, the knights were no match for the White Queen.</p>
<p id="line_729">If Blanc had fought seriously, the Imperial army would likely have been wiped out. They were convinced of their victory, not realizing their luck in avoiding their complete demise.</p>
<p id="line_730">Then, Blanc—</p>
<p id="line_731">She left her host body and cut ties with the physical world as her parting gift for Blanche. In order for no one to ever touch her flesh and let it rest in immortal beauty, Blanc cast a special seal to bury Blanche beneath this land.</p>
<p id="line_732">“Good night, Blanche. I’ll have the souls of those who kept their promise sent to you as well, so that you will not feel lonely on the other side, and may you rest in peace there.”</p>
<p id="line_733">Many souls with shining sparks gathered around Blanche’s soul. Then, Blanc carefully released them all.

<p id="line_734">“Farewell. When would I…meet you again…”</p>
<p id="line_735">Perhaps Blanc didn’t want to consume Blanche’s soul and for that she pretended to be destroyed by the knights.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_736">A gust of wind howled howled across the land.</p>
