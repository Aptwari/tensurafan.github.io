# Chapter 4: The Blue|Devil's Murmur

Nice to meet you all. My name is Raine. Eh, you don't know me? Come on, cut the crap, or do I need to slap some sense into you? Go back to school and study.

.........

......

...

Oops, excuse me. I guess I snapped a bit. No, I'm usually a ladylike person, but sometimes I get violent. Yes, sometimes. But aside from that, since you don't know who I am, I guess I should introduce myself.

As I said before, my name is Raine. I'm a servant ---no, a maid. I am a faithful maid of the Demon Lord Guy Crimson-sama. I've known Guy-sama for a long time. Before the creation of the sky and earth, perhaps. How long ago was that?

I don't know. Or rather, do you remember the exact time you were born? You don't, do you? That's what it is. Ignore the stupid question because it's inconvenient. I was invincible because I was derived from the Great Spirit of Darkness.

No. I thought I was invincible. I'm not going to deny that I got a little carried away. And because of that I made a huge mistake. I teamed up with a like-minded to attack those who seemed even bigger than I was. Looking back on it now, I was such an idiot. That bastard was so powerful. We thought we could win two against one, but he beat us flat out. The guy who beat us was Demon Lord Guy Crimson-sama, aka, the Red Primordial Rouge.

By the way, it was Green Primordial Vert, or Mizeri, who challenged Guy-sama together with me. We are very good friends. My job is Mizeri's and Mizeri's salary is mine. That's how we still work together as coworkers.

"Raine! Don't slack off and get your cleaning done."

Tsk, I'm introducing you to her, but she's being a bitch.

"What did you say?"

"No, nothing."

"Yeah? I hope so."

Dangerous, dangerous. Mizeri is very perceptive. She catches on when I'm slacking off and it's tricky to keep up with her. I'll just try to clean up again without her getting mad at me. So, yeah, we were in the middle of an introduction.

Mizeri and I lost to Guy-sama, but this revealed one fact. A demon will be extinguished when their core is shattered. However! We, the primordials, can come back from any condition! I heard that the True Dragons inherit memories and reset their personalities, but in our case, our personalities remained intact.

Guy-sama's partner, Frost Dragon Velzard-sama, used to re-educate her younger brother, but that doesn't apply to us primordials. Seriously, isn't that amazing? I would love to brag about it, but unfortunately there are some drawbacks.

It takes a long time to recover. But, you know, that is a minor issue. What's important is the other one. Immortality is good, but the loser must become subservient. And in our case, that was Guy-sama. This revelation had thrown a wrench into the balance of power among the demons, creating a distorted equilibrium. This is either our fault or our fault.

By the way, Mizeri's opinion is the former and mine is the latter. Did you know that? You're not prejudiced against me, are you? Stop looking at me like I'm a bad child.

Well, that's beside the point. I'll tell you some secret information about demons. That is, how to kill one. The primordials cannot be destroyed, but they can be made subservient. However, since that is not as enforceable as servitude, it is not quite an absolute obedience.

We can also disobey Guy-sama if we want to. I don't, though. And to a certain extent, he has the power to force us to do so. It's also a hassle to disobey. Next, the primordial's immediate family.

Normally, except for that idiot Black Primordial Noir, primordials have many other subordinates. They are useful as maidservants because they obey all orders from their superiors of the same color. There may be a misunderstanding if I say 'spawning'. It's too complicated to explain in detail, so I'll give you a quick explanation.

A newborn lesser demon is colorless. They have knowledge but no ego, and they're weak. Most of them are often summoned by humans, and are called 'servant types'. When these demons grow a sense of self (ego), they're called autonomous (self-supporting) demons. When they evolve into greater demons, they are characterized by their nature and personality, and the colors of their lineage are clearly distinguishable. Or, the higher-ups could scout and form a faction. Rather, this may be the mainstream thing to do.

Mizeri is so diligent that she manages her own faction. They've even infiltrated human society and run several groups, such as the Apostles of Verte.

Me?

I'm, well, I guess I'll pass on that hassle. Hey, stop messing around. I'm the same as Black? Are you kidding me? I have my own faction! Black pisses me off, so don't ever think anything stupid again. Damn it.

Back to the subject at hand. So, newborn demons don't have factions, but by the time they evolve into greater demons, they're color-coded to belong to a faction. Some of them are born with colors, but they are often reincarnated demons. Since demons are immortal, they will reincarnate even if they die. Even those relatives will disappear if their cores are shattered. However, demons are stubborn and can resurrect after their souls are shattered. Especially those close to the primary colors.

If you're lucky enough to beat one, then you'd have to crush the core. Incidentally, with newborn servant types of weak willpower, you won't need to be so careful. Those are small fry that has only knowledge of battle but no experience, so it might die just by destroying the body. Well, there's nothing to worry about. And well, here's our secret. Since we figured this out, I feel like our defeat was also meaningful. Rather, if anything, we did a good job.

![soft scene break]

So, in the spirit of self-sacrifice, we serve Guy-sama, and it's a lot more fun than it seems. Guy-sama seems to have decided to leave the struggle for supremacy in the underworld and work on earth. Guy-sama is apparently a very disciplined man, so we were with him.

"You can do what you want with your life, too," he said.

But I don't care about that. I want to be on the winning side all the time. Guy-sama can't be defeated, so I think the position I'm in is the best. Well, if Guy-sama loses, that's interesting. So, at that time, I said,

"No. My mission is to be of service to you."

What do you think? It's almost like a perfect maid, don't you think? You won't find a maid as loyal me anywhere else---at least I thought so...

"That's right. You are the king. We are your subjects. That is the eternal and immortal truth."

Mizeri... You act so good! It's probably from the heart, so it's a bad idea. I guess my rivals are not so easy to deal with. But Mizeri seems to trust me, so I've stopped showing her things. Oh well, what can I do? So the rotten relationship between Mizeri and I continues.

We wandered from place to place and settled in our current base. It's the most frigid place a creature could ever live in, but I'm a demon, so I don't mind. That's a lie. When I was trying to wash my clothes, they just froze. When I poked them in anger, they just fell to pieces. I got pissed off. Well, I made that mistake, but I'm fine.

"You ought to be more careful about what you do!"

"Raine, I think I should be a little concerned about that, don't you?"

Guy-sama warned me about this, so I'm starting to care a little bit. That's where the servants comes in. My subordinates make it easy on me! So, I haven't failed once since then. I have grown up too. Our job is not only washing clothes. We are so good that people say we are all-around versatile maids. We also do laundry, singing, dancing, playing musical instruments, and fine arts to meet Guy-sama's needs.

Well, there have been some failures in cooking and laundry. But we all learn from our mistakes. It's the same with demons, so let's forget about the past. My specialty, frankly, is painting. I love abstract painting. The other day I painted Mizeri as a model and she was moved to tears.

"I was furious."

"Then it was a great success!"

"You really are..."

Mizeri was stunned, but I didn't care. Her rage means that her emotions were in turmoil. That's a big deal to a demon, a spiritual life form. I was scared of my talent. Needless to say, when I paint Guy-sama or Velzard-sama, I have to choose a concrete painting. It's always a big hit because they're so perfect.

"That's right. You can draw if you put your mind to it. That's why I'm even more annoyed..."

Mizeri said something, but as always, I'll just let it slide. By the way, let me tell you about one of my hobbies. The extreme cold is so harsh and inhospitable. It's a snowstorm outside. It is all white.

With such a backdrop, the inside of the 'Barrier' is in everlasting summer mode. We even changed the terrain to create a lake and a white sandy beach. I lay out on beach chairs and let the caterers serve me. It was the best kind of entertainment. I wonder how much energy is spent on my hobby. I can't stop smiling just thinking about it. This is also very popular with Guy-sama.

"If you think about these things, Raine is the best."

"I admit it. I knew you were great, Raine."

Ufufu, Mizeri also gave me a compliment. At this rate, I will continue to utilize my hobbies in my work.

![hard scene break]

Oh yeah, I have an important job not to forget. Occasionally, I am a guide for the Walpurgis.

Walpurgis. In the early days, as the name suggests, the three members demon lords got together to enjoy a meal. Guy-sama and Milim-sama. And also Ramiris-sama.

![break]

Milim-sama is the niece of Velzard-sama and her power is immense. There was a time when she lost control and went on a rampage, and it was beyond description. We could have joined the battle because we would not die, but to do so would have destroyed the planet itself, so in the end, Mizeri, Velzard-sama, and I were tasked with containing the aftermath of the battle. We're not going to do it again.

If Ramiris-sama hadn't helped us, we would have fallen before the battle was over. So that's why we love Ramiris-sama as well as Guy-sama. Of course, we respect Milim-sama, so we are very excited to have all three of them together.

The definition of 'Walpurgis' has changed over the years. The number of demon lords is on the rise. Keeping mankind from dying out. That is Guy-sama's job, but he's been recruiting more people to help him do it. The first person to become the fourth demon lord was Dagruel-sama. Actually, he was the one who suffered the most when Guy-sama and Milim-sama fought. He also helped us prevent the earth from being affected.

Even so, Dagruel-sama's dominion has turned into a barren land...well, that's not my problem, so it's fine. He's managed to live with magic, but it didn't stop the desert from expanding. It's all settled now, but it seems to have been harder back then. I just said good luck and cheered from afar.

The next demon lord was Luminas-sama, the 'Queen of Nightmares'. She is the only daughter of the vampire ancestor, and is very strong, but I think she should be the one to talk about it. She was supposed to be the ancestor of the god human beings born from Veldanava-sama.

Veldanava-sama sought a wise being to speak to him. With the birth of angels and demons, his need was satisfied. That's why he tried to bring civilization to earth, and it seems that the ancestor^[Word used is "shinso."] was expected to play that role.

Well, it failed. They were immortal and didn't need to produce any offspring. That's why they lost. Or, like us demons, the ancestors didn't have a gender. So it seems they had to wait for tens of thousands of years or more for a race to be born that could thrive on earth. I heard it all before.

But the ancestor didn't give up. It kept running these forbidden experiments to fulfill Veldanava-sama's expectations. That bastard loved to experiment more than the prosperity of his descendants. Whether that was a good thing or a bad thing is difficult for me to say, but I can tell you this, He was an annoying asshole!

I don't know how many times humanity perished because of that idiot's experiments. However, it's also true that because of that idiot's experiments, true human beings (high humans) were born. Although the eternal god human beings could not be created, it contributed to the birth of mankind.

You don't believe that, do you? You're right. I didn't see it with my own eyes, so I don't believe it either. I heard that the ancestor created two races by analyzing his own body. They were the high humans and the vampires. It's not the way they were supposed to be born, but it's just as well they were born.

By the time Guy-sama was summoned to earth, the human race had already spread. The high humans built a huge nation, larger than the human beings today. However...

It seems that both races had their strengths and weaknesses. Although the high humans inherited strong magical power, their spirits had problems. As you can see from the stupidity of summoning Guy-sama, they thought that they were the best of the best. There's a saying in other worlds that 'Those who are arrogant have not been around long enough' and that's exactly what happened. They were destroyed in the blink of an eye.

And as for the vampires, they had their own problems. But was that a good thing? They're still alive. A strong body and powerful magic. High immortality, and a mature mind. It's a good thing they had all these things, but they were always vulnerable to being out in the sun.

They couldn't truly be the supreme ruler of the earth. That ancestor asshole continued to experiment. Well, I was there at the time, so I can generally remember what he was doing. At that time, spirits from the Great Spirit of each attribute had already separated and filled the earth with the four major elements. Those spirits took in magical elements and materialized, rather, they had a body. In other words, it was the Ancestor who helped them materialize.

From the 'earth' attribute, the earth spirit (High Dwarf) was born. From the 'water' attribute, the water spirit (Siren) was born. From the 'fire' attribute, the fire spirit (Enki) was born. And from the 'wind' attribute, the wind spirit (High Elf) was born.

Up to this point, it was still within the acceptable range, but from here, the Ancestor's recklessness began. That asshole experimented with breeding these races and gave birth to various species. To be honest, for a lady like me, it was quite a shock.

The result was the birth of various species such as dwarves, ogres and beastmen, which were successful examples. There were many failures that were buried in the shadows and later deteriorated into goblin-like monsters.

Guy-sama was also worried that this couldn't be left alone. But! As long as Veldanava was left alone, we couldn't punish the Ancestor. As a result of his experiments, the diversity had certainly increased One might say that the world had become more complicated, but it had also become more interesting. Yes, if it's someone else's affair. For me, it was all right because it didn't bother me at all.

"I don't suppose you enjoy watching me get in trouble, do you?"

"No way, no way! That's a misunderstanding, Guy-sama. I'm Guy-sama's faithful maid."

I decide on a beautiful curtesy. The fact that I was able to get away with it perfectly must be the result of my daily efforts. Well, I was troubled by the Ancestor as I survived such a critical situation. However his experiments led to his downfall.

"Ah! My daughter! You are my masterpiece---"

"It is time for judgement 'Disintegration---'"

I guess he had it coming, huh? To have his own body turned to dust by his daughter...

Well, that guy went too far. I was relieved too, and that's a secret. This is the secret episode of the fifth demon lord Luminas-sama...but don't tell anyone.

After that, the sixth one to become demon lord was Dino-sama. By the way, can I be frank with you? What? I already am? Well then, I don't need to be shy. I'll just say it. I don't like to call Dino names.

Because he's a piece of crap. He doesn't work. He's the perfect example of depravity. I could have forgiven him if he didn't work, but he also puts me to work! That is unacceptable. I can't let him do that anymore. Just give it to Mizeri. Then I will forgive you. And when I said that, do you know what that guy said?

"No, because I'll get in trouble if I ask Mizeri, right?"

That's right! It's bullshit! I'm angry, and by saying that, it's like saying Mizeri is more scary than me. Well, she's often angry, but that's not to say that I don't have a dislike for Mizeri... Huh? Similarity? Are you stupid? Do you think you can handle a 'primordial'? There are right and wrong things to say in this world. People who don't understand that deserve to get beaten to death. Those are Raine's words of advice.

![hard scene break]

In this way, six people became demon lords, and the Walpurgis became a business debriefing session. At first it was just a tea party, but it turned into a business meeting before I knew it. It sounds cumbersome, so I'll pass.

"Raine!"

That's a lie. I will serve as a guide properly. Everyone seems to be very busy. About one person is slacking off. If you look closely, there are a lot of people working, but that important job of managing the human race hasn't diminished at all, has it?

First of all, Guy-sama. It's a madhouse. Except for Walpurgis, Mizeri was also helping desperately. I have to support her. I'll take care of the cooking and laundry, thank you.

Next, Milim-sama. Here, too, she is also more serious than you might think. If there are skirmishes between nations, she would go to them and sanction them both. If a country is under attack by a giant beast, she would go there to help people. She doesn't always act like a demon lord, but that's typical of Milim-sama.

And then, Ramiris-sama. The social recluse. She doesn't come out of the labyrinth of her own making. But that's okay. I owe Ramiris-sama a debt of gratitude, so I can forgive anything.

Dagruel-sama is the same situation. After all, it seems to be a mess to clean up after the wreck. He doesn't have time for anything else, so it would be a great help to him even if he could slow down the desertification process.

The amazing one is Luminas-sama. She's a far cry from that Ancestor and is very good. Before I knew it, she had the complete control over the vampire forces. On top of that, she is protecting the humans who have lost their strength. Vampires, who used to see humans as bait, now follow Luminas-sama's orders to protect the human race. Let's put it bluntly. How did you do it? That's seriously a great accomplishment.

And next, in contrast to Luminas-sama, is that piece of crap.

"Dino-sama, why don't you work a little harder?"

"I don't need you to tell me that!"

I don't understand. Was there ever a greater insult than this? No, no. I guess that's why Dino is a natural enemy of mine. Well, under the circumstances, six people weren't enough. Therefore, I started to recruit more people.

But then Luminas-sama retired. The reason for this was that the new recruits were too stupid. Many had an arrogant attitude towards Luminas-sama and Ramiris-sama. Finally, they went on a rampage to show them what they were made of, but by then she had run out of patience with them.

Luminas-sama is a beautiful girl, and her opponents would think she was lower than them. In order to break through this situation, she may have decided that it would be more advantageous to have a more dangerous looking being as the demon lord. As Luminas-sama's replacement, Roy was put in.

"I will now go behind the scenes to support everyone," she said. "I'll put Roy in the front as the demon lord, is that all right?"

If this were Dino's statement, he would have been accused by everyone of trying to slack off. However, this is Luminas-sama, the trusted and proven leader. With the circumstances being what they are, everyone accepted it willingly. That was the beginning of a new era.

Powerful majins began to rise in prominence as demon lords. The minimum requirement is the acquisition of a Demon Lord Seed. To fulfill this requirement, ambitious majins, such as Kazalim, became demon lords. Once again, the purpose of Walpurgis changed. It was decided that a meeting would be held with the consent of three people, to make a treaty or agreement between the demon lords. It was also decided that it would be at this meeting where new demon lords would be approved or not. For me, it was a funny development.

But, well, Guy-sama seemed to have no complaints about it, because it served its purpose. If Guy-sama is convinced, then I can't complain. A new system was being established.

![hard scene break]

While looking after Guy-sama's personal belongings, I serve as a guide for the occasional Walpurgis banquets. A number of demon lords have come and gone. Before long, the names of the ten great demon lords began to spread.

And then the slime came on the scene. Demon Lord Rimuru-sama. I first saw him in Walpurgis when Demon Lord Clayman called him in. Even so, I kind of miss Clayman. Even though he was weaker than me, I can admit that he had the courage to call himself a demon lord. Besides, he was good at coordinating and was surprisingly useful. Convenient, wasn't it? If I pushed him a little, he'd take care of the troublesome work, too. Oh dear, I wonder where he went wrong...

It was a shame at the end, but he chose the wrong person to oppose. Mizeri, who went to pick up Rimuru-sama, came back and said "Clayman's life expectancy may be running out".

And she was right. I was the host of the meeting, but once I gave the floor to Rimuru-sama, it was a one-sided discussion. It was refreshing to watch, but there was one thing that bothered me. Yeah, it wasn't so much related to Rimuru-sama as it was to Ramiris-sama's servant.

"Isn't that a black dependent?"

"Right. I felt his presence when I picked up Rimuru-sama, so I'm sure of it."

"No way. He's so free-spirited and selfish, how could one possibly follow someone like that?"

"Well, I don't know, do you? I don't know what he's thinking, and I don't want to know or care what he thinks, but..."

Well, that's right. I think it's exactly as Mizeri said. That guy, the Black Primordial Noir, is both weird and selfish. He's one of us, but honestly, I don't want to get involved with him. Because he tied with Guy-sama! Even if Mizeri and I challenged him together, we would have had a difficult time. That fact made me feel a sense of weakness, even though I had never fought him in person.

No, I was just showing off. Rather than having a difficult time against him, I honestly believe that I can't win. Because Guy-sama and Black weren't serious at all. The two of them just playing with each other, but the battle was in a realm we couldn't follow. Well, I have my pride as a primordial, so I won't ever admit it. If possible, I really don't want to get into trouble with Black.

![hard scene break]

This is the worst. I'm going to fight with Black. Why did I do this to myself...?

I'm wondering why when I'm such a good girl. Maybe they found out that I stole Mizeri's treats? No, I blamed it on my subordinate (archdemon) so I shouldn't be suspected. So why, I wonder, but things happen. I decided that this was an opportunity. Because I don't like him. He doesn't have any factions, he does things on his own, and he's willing to stand in Guy-sama's way.

He could incarnate if he wanted to, but I'm annoyed that he wasn't interested in it. That being said, I was pissed off that he didn't evolve and remained an archdemon for a long time, as if he had no interest in the world. It's probably Black's doing, too, by encouraging the remaining three colors to stay in a state of equilibrium, and if he's really a demon, he should aim for the future of evolution according to the rules!

After all, I have to say I'm crazy here. He's certainly strong, but I'm strong too. Maybe I won't win, but 'maybe' is the main word. Battles are very compatible with each other. Black doesn't know what I'm capable of, so I think he might let his guard down. So, if I go for it, there's a chance. My good point is that I'm positive. With my theoretical armament fully armed, I was ready for the battle with Black.

.........

......

...

"I was feeling a passionate murderous intent, but my hands were tied. Rather, I'd prefer you call me Diablo, Bleu---no, you've been given the name Raine."

I was a little happy to hear that. I thought he wasn't interested in other people, but now he even remembers my name. Huh, maybe I should rethink it a little bit.

"Yes. My name is Raine. It was given to me by the great Guy-sama, the Red Primordial Rouge, the strongest of our primordial breed. Not like you, who was named by some demon lord mutt (hybrid) of some unknown species."

I felt a little better and tried to incite him. I called Rimuru-sama a mutt. Personally, I like the slime because he's cute, and Rimuru-sama seems to be a good demon lord, so I thought it would be a good tactic against Bla---Diablo. It didn't work.

"What? Do you want to die? No, you want to disappear from the world. Kufufufufu, I'm going to give you what you want."

His eyes seemed quite serious. Well, Diablo doesn't always let anyone know what he's thinking, so I didn't think he'd get that emotional and pissed off.

"Let's fight, Diablo! Oh, I'm looking forward to it. I've been wanting to fight you ever since I've sensed you fighting the White Primordial in the east."

What a relief it was that I was using the skill, 'Mist'. If I split up my body beforehand, I can come back even if one of me dies. Otherwise, I would never want to fight an opponent that I might not be able to beat. By the way, it was true that I was really interested in the battle between Diablo and the White Primordial (Blanc).

Because I had also fought the White Primordial (Blanc). The reason is jealousy. For some reason, Diablo had a respect for the White Primordial. I wanted to see what that power was like. As I recall, I was able to bring the game to a draw thanks to 'Mist'. To put it the other way around, the game was a loss---no, it was still a tie.

I didn't lose. Only to Guy-sama can I admit defeat, because I'm a capable girl. And yet the battle raged on. Maybe I was too serious. I used all my strength to hunt down Diablo with everything I had.

In terms of magicules, we're evenly matched in quantity, I may even be better than him. What a surprise. But I'm not stupid enough to be so careless. Diablo said that he didn't to be serious against me. It's frustrating, but I think he meant what he said.

"Am I a sore loser? I know you just incarnated and can't give it your all, but that's no excuse, okay?"

I try to tell him that, but I know what I'm really saying. This perverted guy isn't that kind of idiot. He's one of the top two guys I thought were trouble. He would never make the kind of mistakes that some small fry would make. But this was unexpected. Before I knew it, a stacked magic circle painted with glowing spells had appeared around me.

What? Wait? Moreover, isn't that spell holy magic, which demons are not good at? It's impossible not to be surprised. Luminas-sama's signature 'Disintegration' spell was aimed at me from all sides. Oh, I understood at that moment that I might have lost.

.........

......

...

I'm sure you were worried. Of course, I'm fine. Didn't I just say that I have the 'Mist' Skill to be safe? Girls will hate you for that kind of nitpicking. Don't think, but feel. Just sympathize with them, and they'll be happy. Of course, so will I!

But that Diablo guy is beyond rude. Bringing up another person in the middle of a battle. Testarossa? Who is that? You gotta bring them here. I was indignant, but then I was shocked to learn that it was the White Primordial. I mean, what? Let's calm down for a minute.

Huh??

Why does the White Primordial (Blanc) have a name? I was still trying to set up Diablo, though I knew he would see through my act. I thought that would happen, because he's been a very tricky character since he was the Black Primordial. It pisses me off. If it weren't for this guy, I would have laughed at him for being a sore loser.

But for now, the Testarossa case is more important. It seems that Guy-sama was not the only one who was hiding with me. This is very bad, indeed. For a while now, Diablo has been proudly talking about Demon Lord Rimuru. It was annoying with all the Rimuru-sama this and Rimuru-sama that and so on and so forth, but it's too much of a distraction to talk about important topics. What annoys me is that he's doing it for real. Guy-sama seems to be annoyed, but I have to put up with it because he is my partner. I managed to get out the shocking story of how Demon Lord Rimuru has taken on other 'primordials' as his subordinates.

I don't want to believe it. If he can make me believe it, I have strategically lost. But unfortunately, it seems to be the truth. It's the worst. The White Primordial Blanc is Testarossa. The Purple Primordial Violet is Ultima. The Yellow Primordial Jaune is Carrera.

Until now, the balance of power had been in balance for so long, but now it's collapsing in an instant. I hope these kinds of changes would take decades or centuries, but the reality is brutal. Living freely without constraints. I sometimes think that's the right way for a demon...but shouldn't we be competing with each other? Isn't it wrong to be united into one force? Then one side is too strong, and there would be no competition. But he's done it...isn't that right?

Demon Lord Rimuru, I think he's dangerous from the bottom of my heart Until now, the Ancestor asshole and the annoying Diablo have been two of the top names on my list of problems. But today---right now---Demon Lord Rimuru has taken the top spot by a landslide. He is the one I should be worried about at all costs. Hostility should be avoided, even if it means rubbing smoke in it. Unlike Guy-sama, I'm a good girl. Besides making me angry, I'll just go with the flow and call him 'Rimuru-sama' like I really mean it. I decided in my mind that it was good to do so.

![hard scene break]

We pulled back, leaving things to chance. It's very unusual. Because Guy-sama's real purpose was to deal with the situation because he had detected some very serious force being activated on the spot.

"Yes. No matter what happens here, Rimuru-sama will take care of it."

Diablo was boasting, but I can't believe that he accepted it. However, as a mere maid, it is out of the question for me to question Guy-sama's decision. In the end, I left it to Rimuru-sama, and I was relieved that it was the right decision in the end. Because Guy-sama was worried about Luminas-sama. Luminas-sama's control of Western Nations has made Guy-sama's job much easier. So I worry about it.

I agree with it. There's no way I'm going to take over. Anyway, I'm glad to hear that it seemed to be finished safely. It's a shame that Mizeri failed her mission, but what can you do when you're dealing with a White Primordial named Testarossa.

"Was she strong?"

"I didn't fight her, but she looked nasty. Having a name and a body made her a demon noble. She's a lot stronger than a bad demon lord."

I'm sure. She was so troublesome even when I fought her, so if she's evolved, she may be out of control. In the first place, she didn't care much about winning or losing. She's willing to accept tactical defeats as long as she can get the result she wants. That's why that woman is unfazed by defeat. She was number three on my top secret troublemaker list---now number four. Oh, actually, she's still number three because the Ancestor was destroyed.

Wow, looking at it this way, the top members of the trouble list are all in Rimuru-sama forces. Carrera is also trouble, and Ultima is a land mine if handled incorrectly. I have a lot of respect for him, controlling those guys.

"Let's try not to pick a fight with Rimuru-sama."

"I'd like to say something all of a sudden, but I understand what you mean and I agree with you. Rather, that's the line I want to say to you."

"How rude. I'm not going to cross that troublesome guy, either."

"Really? You're the one who wanted to challenge Guy-sama to a fight. That's unbelievable."

That was, well, a youthful indiscretion. I'm growing up and I won't make the same mistake. And so, that's how we came to look at Rimuru-sama.

![hard scene break]

It's bad! It's bad! Rimuru-sama, it's seriously bad! It's the first time I met you, but you are dangerous! What? I already met him at Walpurgis? Shut up.

What do I care about that? I'm talking about Rimuru-sama's trouble! It's all I can say, but that's what happens to everyone. Because, listen to me. Rimuru-sama, you evolved us as well! I can't believe it. But it's true.

I'm a good girl who tells the truth, even though I'm a demon. However, I can be of service to Guy-sama now. In terms of strength, I had barely been acknowledged by Guy-sama. In fact, if we had to take on the 'Octagram' crowd, there was no one we could beat.

But now that I think about it, the current demon lords are very good. I could beat Ramiris-sama, but I'm not so sure. If she gains her true form, it's us who would lose. I want to hurt that jerk Dino, but if I do, I'll be the one who cries. That's why I'll forgive him, and want him to be thankful for my generosity. Oops, but I digress. Let's get back to the story of how we evolved.

.........

......

...

It all started when Diablo called Guy-sama. That why we came to visit Rimuru-sama's country, but Guy-sama was not happy because he was pushed around by Diablo. I thought that it would be trouble and wanted to stay home, but I couldn't afford to do so. However, that was the correct thing to do after participating

Rimuru-sama hadn't met Velzard-sama before and they were exchanging greetings. Afterwards, he greeted me very politely.

One could fall in love with him^["Horeru" can also mean 'to be charmed by'.]. I thought I should pretend to be a misunderstood girl and go for it. Of course, I didn't do it out of thin air, did I? If I had done it, I am confident that it would have been over for me, so it was the right decision. And then, the friendly tea party began.

I was observing behind Guy-sama, but Rimuru-sama somehow seems to be similar to Guy-sama. I saw that they reacted the same way and had a hard time with Diablo. I saw that he and Guy-sama have the same reactions. Needless to say, it made me like him a lot more.

But there were other things that bothered me, too. First, Rimuru-sama's servant. He seems to be called Benimaru, but why does he seem stronger than the demon lords? The other one is Shion-san. She's become much stronger from the last time we met! I can somehow feel a hint of evil in her. Does she have an advantage over a demon?

What is this? I wonder if I can win if I fight seriously? However, for me to admit my defeat would be to lose the purpose of my existence. Absolutely not. So I kept a cool face.

But you know, I had to work pretty hard. Because those two weren't the only ones with any hint of strength. Well, wait a minute. That wasn't Testarossa. There are at least three or four other people here besides them. Why are there so many demon lord class under a demon lord's command?

I thought that only Guy-sama was allowed to do that, but it seems I need to change my mind. As I was making up my mind, the smell of tea was wafting through the air. Is it a break? But we're maids, so it's bad manners to have tea together. Unfortunately, I was thinking about seeing off, so I was led to the next room. To our surprise, there was even a cake for us. As expected of Rimuru-sama. Just by looking at this attention to detail, I have to admit that he's qualified to be a king!

And then, it was time to taste it. Is this a strawberry shortcake? I look like a pro at cooking. I've confined a head chef of a top hotel to learn his craft, so I'm proud to say that my cooking skills are as good as those guys. In other words, what I'm trying to say is that I can't be satisfied with a half-hearted taste.

"It's so good!"

What?! You're kidding me!! This is so good!

![full page image](image13)

It looks simple on the outside, but it's a complex harmony of flavors. Oh, so there are several layers. There's a different kind of cream in between. Aren't these the kind of things that take a lot of time and effort to make? And the fact that the flavors are so evenly distributed shows that all the ingredients have been carefully planned out.

"It's amazing..."

Mizeri is also impressed. Our specialty has always been fresh fruitcakes and sugary pancakes that rely on high quality ingredients. I didn't expect to see so much technology being used in a single cake.

"Is this technology from the other world?" I blurted out.

"That's right," Shion-san answered. "This is a strawberry short made with three kinds of cream, developed by Mr. Yoshida and Shuna-sama. It also contains a small amount of black rice powder, which is very popular with monsters."

Yoshida-san is an otherworlder, isn't he? I know who Shuna-sama is. She is the person who showed us around and even served us. Smooth, refined movements and an unassuming demeanor. Even from my perspective, who is known as a perfect maid, she was highly praised for her excellent customer service. Moreover, her cooking skills are also quite impressive. While enjoying the cake, I talk to that damned Diablo.

"By the way, aren't you stronger from the last time I fought you?"

I had always wondered if he was stronger than from the last time I fought him. I couldn't ask him in front of Guy-sama, but now I could ask him in person. I can't miss this opportunity. Because ever since we evolved into demon nobles, we haven't been able to gain any more strength. Our experience has made us stronger. However, that's not what I'm talking about; I'm talking about the existence itself that could not evolve. And yet, this Diablo guy so easily...

"Kufufu, you're still stupid, aren't you?"

That was Diablo's response. I don't know. What is this annoying feeling? Can I hit him? Yeah, sure---and my inner conscience is all for it. I think I should do it. Just as I was about to act on that thought, Diablo interrupted me by saying.

"Kufufufu. It is all thanks to my lord, Rimuru-sama. He has rewarded me for my services!"

Damn this bastard! You're acting like you're just trying to trick me. Then I'll be the one to return the favor.

"Oh, I see. So then you're not much better off either. I agree with you that Rimuru-sama is a great man, no doubt about it, but that's another matter. You yourself are relying on Rimuru-sama."

Well, I told him. It's only because of Rimuru-sama that you have evolved, so your skills are nothing to sneeze at! However...

"Yes. That's right, but is there any problem?"

This Diablo bastard just admitted it without a word. And he's looking at me like he's happy to see me---like he knows what's going on! That's annoying. I look like an idiot.

"Raine, don't do it. Even Guy-sama isn't going to win an argument with this guy. It's okay for you to cry."

Even Mizeri said such a thing. But unfortunately, that opinion seems to be correct. I stared at Diablo in frustration. Then something unexpected happened. Shion-san smacked Diablo on the head, making a nice thwacking sound. I was so happy. Moreover, she even preached to him.

"You're being cheeky, Tea-boy! You are not to be rude to our guests."

When I heard that, I couldn't help but pump my fists in a pose. Glancing to thee side, I saw Mizeri smiling happily. Of course she did. This is just too funny!

Then, leaving us alone, Diablo and Shion-san started fighting, which continued until Shuna-sama came onto the scene. Shuna-sama.

I have no qualms in adding the 'sama' anymore. Shion-san, who can quarrel with Diablo, is amazing, but Shuna-sama who can beat up Shion-san and Diablo together, was most wonderful in my point of view. There's a lot to learn from her.

By the way, the quarrel between Diablo and Shion-san really was a quarrel, which surprised both Mizeri and me. Shuna-sama came to call us, so we obeyed quietly. She told us that she would teach us the recipe for the cake. She told us that Guy-sama had asked her to teach us how to make the cake. We are very grateful. I must tell her how I feel when I am shown into the parlor where Rimuru-sama is.

"As expected of Demon Lord Rimuru-sama, the cake was wonderful."

Oops, I was late. I'd like to acknowledge Mizeri's omission.

"I am deeply moved that you have been so generous in teaching me your recipe."

Then Rimuru-sama laughed and said it was no big deal.

"Thank you. If we can continue to work together, it would be desirable for me."

He calls that cooperation when we receive it unilaterally? That's very generous of him. However, my recognition was still insufficient.

"You guys, Rimuru will give you strength. You should be more grateful."

Guy-sama suddenly told me...

Mizeri and I had been given the honor of evolving into a 'true demon lord'.

.........

......

...

Right? It's dangerous, right? Really, just what is Rimuru-sama? Looking back on it now, all I can think of is that it's dangerous. We will make effective use of the power he's given us, and if he's ever in trouble, we'll be happy to help him.

The amount of magicules is increasing day by day, and we can be of more help to Guy-sama than ever before. We owe it all to Rimuru-sama, and it is only natural that we should return the favor. However, there is Testarossa in his country, so I doubt there will be any situations that require my help...

That's all for self-deprecation. It's time for today's mock battle with Mizeri. Daily special training is indispensable to get used to our own power. Well then, to the training grounds---Oh? It's unlikely that someone is making a joke at such a time.

"Raine! Someone just broke into the 'Barrier.'"

"I know, I know. But this is---"

This is no longer a time for mock battles, nor is it a time for idle chatter. That's it for me. I look forward to seeing you all again.
