		<hr>
		<p class="c11 c10 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I-I&rsquo;m dying here, seriously&hellip;&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Laplace speaks, he emerges before another man in the room.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As mentioned just now, his body is heavily wounded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You&rsquo;ve taken quite a beating now, haven&rsquo;t you?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The owner of the room, a black-haired young man, responds rather coldly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This reaction provokes Laplace, prompting him to start complaining with a rude tone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hold on a second here, wasn&rsquo;t this supposed to be some simple walk-in-the-park task? The infiltration was hard - much harder than anticipated, but escaping from there was even more difficult. No ordinary man can get through that even with multiple lives... &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s because I have faith in you. That, and you can&rsquo;t be killed anyway.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I see you&rsquo;re still as cruel as ever.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace begins fake crying, but the young man continues without showing any emotion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So, what did you learn from investigating the Western Saints Church? &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;About that.... I really don&rsquo;t want to say this but&hellip;&hellip; I seriously can&rsquo;t find anything.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man doesn&rsquo;t show any emotion as he listens to Laplace&rsquo;s report.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His reaction, or lack thereof, towards this report makes it feel almost as if he expected to hear it; so he lets out a grin and replies:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi&mdash;&mdash;why are you doing this again, why can&rsquo;t you ever just be honest? You&rsquo;ve probably already discovered something by now, haven&rsquo;t you?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace shrugs and sighs upon hearing the young man&rsquo;s reply.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You got me there. These pieces of information were all really difficult to obtain, and I was planning to sell them at a high price, yet you&rsquo;ve seen through me like it was nothing. I&rsquo;ll accept this defeat.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehehe, it makes me happy to hear your praises like this, but still, don&rsquo;t expect a bonus, okay? &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing this, Laplace sighs: &#12300;What a mean character.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hey now, don&rsquo;t say that. I did say I&rsquo;d give you the payment as agreed upon. Anyway, the consciousness of &ldquo;that thing&rdquo; has already been settled. I&rsquo;ve transferred the &#12302;Demon Lord&#12303;inside me into the body of a homunculus.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man smiles gleefully at this declaration. He then rings a bell and summons the secretary that seemed to have been waiting outside of the room. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Did you summon me?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looks elegant and dignified - a model secretary through and through. &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her beauty is decorated by pure, white skin which perfectly suits her braided blonde hair. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her eyes are bright blue in colour, as if shining with mysterious lazurite.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">However, while the light in her eyes looks enticing somehow, it does not seem to bear ill will. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh? Eh, could you be&hellip;.?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace becomes suspicious of the woman&rsquo;s appearance, yet in her eyes, Laplace finds a familiar presence. He then seems to recognize her true identity, and the realization quells his inner confusion. He bursts into laughter.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Why are you dressing like this? Has your highness undergone a sex change? I&rsquo;d say it hardly suits you to dress like this. It&rsquo;s completely different from what you used to look like.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shut up. It took me ten years to obtain a body that I can move around freely in, these types of inconveniences are more than tolerable.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman replies rudely, not willing to let Laplace berate her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her model secretary like behavior disappears as she intimately pats Laplace on the shoulder and lets out ruffian laughter without a care. Then she sits down on a chair. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c28 c4"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So, you letting me meet this guy means I can put down the act now, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, I hope you can still keep up the act at least on the outside. But since we&rsquo;re all familiar with each other here, it would be unnecessary. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh? I suppose I&rsquo;ll just do as the boss says then. But for what reason exactly?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;About that, it&rsquo;s because currently you are still too weak, Kazaream. You&rsquo;ve yet to recover your full power, right? Until you&rsquo;ve regained your full strength as the &#12302;Cursed Lord</span><span class="c4">&#12302;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><span class="c0">, you should just sit back and observe Clayman.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kazaream, the woman who looks like a secretary, sighed with discontent at his reply.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kazaream.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is the name of an ancient demon lord. There once was a human named Leon who proclaimed himself a Demon Lord near the border of Kazaream&rsquo;s domain. Kazaream had then attempted to punish Leon for such bold declarations but was unsuccessful in the end.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this former Demon Lord Kazaream is the being that both Demon Lord Clayman and Laplace wish to revive, who is also the president of the Moderate Jester Troupes. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet nowadays, Kazaraem is no longer in possession of such power and thus assumes the body of a fragile woman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">While near death, Kazaream was able to possess the flesh of this young man in a fateful encounter and thus cheating death. A few days earlier the former Demon Lord&rsquo;s Astral Body was finally successfully transferred to the physical body of this homunculus.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now, his power is much weaker than it was during the days of his prime. As a result, Kazaream decided to recognize the young man as his master and to serve as his subordinate. This was the agreement between Kazaream and the young man, which is why he made no objections.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Having spent his time with the young man for ten years, Kazaraem fully recognized this young man as his master.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right. My power has yet to fully recover. I was defeated by that Demon Lord Leon so badly that I even lost my physical body. Sure my soul is able to settle in this homunculus, but this body is too fragile. If I am to fully release my </span><span class="c4">magicule</span><span class="c0">s within it, it would completely destroy this body. That wouldn&rsquo;t be a revival at all...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so, now I see. So even the president is calling you boss. In that case, I too shall accept you as my boss. You are no longer just another client. I guess there&rsquo;s no reason to hide anything from you anymore.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Seriously? You are one stubborn idiot. We&rsquo;ve been collaborating for so long, and I even helped you revive your most precious president. Yet you still wouldn&rsquo;t believe me till now... &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hahaha, that&rsquo;s totally different matter. Speaking of that, the president taking on the appearance of a super model is absolutely hilarious!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Is that so? I don&rsquo;t really care about my appearance.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No no no, the dichotomy between how you look and how you talk is just too much, it&rsquo;s absolutely hilarious.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Whateve&mdash;&mdash;No, I understand now. If I must keep up this act, I need to talk more like a woman.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;No no no, that isn&rsquo;t the problem here, is it? Anyhow, it kind of suits you </span><span class="c4">bett</span><span class="c4">er.... But, how should I put this&hellip; </span><span class="c4">WHAHAHAHA</span><span class="c0">!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace bursts into laughter, unable to continue.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh now, please shut your trap. It&rsquo;s not like I wanted to end up like this. This body is a Sorcerer&rsquo;s Dynasty Sarion&rsquo;s specially modified homunculus that boss has prepared just for me. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah. It&rsquo;s quite expensive. If we didn&rsquo;t prepare the container devoid of a soul, it may have contaminated the transferred soul, resulting in a failed transfer. Speaking of which, if Kazaream hadn&rsquo;t escaped into my body, it might have already been mixed up with impurities and would have made it impossible to separate. In other words, I can&rsquo;t really help with how it looks.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I really appreciate that, Boss.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">But there was no delight in the voice of this young man and Kazaream expresses gratitude towards him.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Even so, he still seems rather irritated and was only able to bring his good mood back after Laplace joined in expressing thanks. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I guess I&rsquo;ll let it go this time. I get that you two must be experiencing a lot of feelings right now, reuniting after such a long time, but I want to talk business now. Let&#39;s hear the results of your investigations, Laplace. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, Kazaream loses his smile and turns towards Laplace. Laplace also nods back, changing his attitude, and starts talking more seriously:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Since you kept your part of this bargain and granted my wish, I would like to show you my sincerity as well. I&rsquo;ve infiltrated the Western Saints Church, wishing to discover its secrets. Yet I was unable to discover any deeper truths.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace says as he begins to describe his investigation in detail. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace&rsquo;s mission this time was to investigate the secrets hidden within the organisation called the &#12302;Western Saints Church&#12303;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This organization in particular is based in Holy Empire Ruberios and claims to be an independent religious organization. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They portray themselves as&#12300;The Just Protectors of The Weak&#12301;and have significant influence over the western states. To the young man, this organization stands as an obstacle between him and his goals. This is why he hired Laplace, a member of the Moderate Jester Troupe jack of all trades, to help find any exploitable weaknesses.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man believes that there&rsquo;s a hidden dark side to the Western Saints Church. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they are indeed agents of justice as they&rsquo;re meant to be, he will have to resort to damaging their reputation by any means possible. But that would be his last draw.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now is not the time to strike yet. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is because the Western Saints Church also happens to have the strongest of the Saints, and Commander of the Holy Imperial Guards, Hinata Sakaguchi.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace isn&rsquo;t finished yet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;And then, since Hinata was absent, I got to infiltrate the church, but I didn&rsquo;t find anything suspicious. So I decided to go to the Holy City of Ruberios and the check out the holy &#12302;Inner Sanctum&#12303; at the top of the Spirit Mountain. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">As he becomes more and more excited with his explanation, Laplace begins to illustrate visually with his hands </span><span class="c4">and feet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There, he witnessed something with his own eyes. A fearsome truth indeed, that he laid eyes upon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I was real surprised, you know. The holy land was filled with holy aura. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Isn&rsquo;t that only natural? It&rsquo;s a holy land after all.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Did ya hit your head or what? Have you become dumber since I last saw you?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No way, I definitely did not! By the way, president, your old tone is back again.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Again with the same shi(t)&mdash;&mdash;My business is irrelevant. Please proceed. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Skeptical about the treatment he&rsquo;s receiving, Laplace continues to report everything he saw.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After sneaking past the Western Saints Church headquarters, Laplace found himself before the Temple of Gods. This is the hall of the Pope, who acts as the Agent of God, but it is also the place where politics are managed as well. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he entered the Temple of Gods, that&rsquo;s when he started to feel something is amiss with the surrounding. He sensed a weak flow of magic that would affect one&rsquo;s psyche. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace possesses the unique skill &#12300;Deceiver&#12301;and because of its defense mechanism, he was able to detect the existence of such intricate magic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">That&rsquo;s a surprise. I didn&rsquo;t anticipate there to be mental magic on par with my own here....</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From there on, Laplace became more cautious and proceeded towards the Holy Church carefully. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace had some knowledge about the enemy organization. However, he had little to no idea about the connection between this Western Saints Church and the Holy Empire Ruberios.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Western Saints Church worships the monotheistic god Ruminas as their deity. It&rsquo;s the same case for Holy Empire Ruberios, and it can be said that both are disciples in the religion of Ruminasism.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But in terms of power, the Western Saints Church far outranks Ruberios.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason being Hinata.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The reasons why the Western Saints Church have grown to become such an elite organization are all thanks to the achievements of Hinata Sakaguchi, dispatching knights to branches of the church in western states, organising</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;group efforts to protect the weak and more</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Western Saints Church was once an organization that spread the teachings of their Goddess Ruminas under the protection of Holy Empire Ruberios. Nowadays they&rsquo;ve suddenly become&#12300;The Just Protector of The Weak&#12301;and lost their ties as a serving organization under the Holy Empire Ruberios.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The reason of this transformation is the Holy Knight Order, which were trained personally by Hinata. And they are the </span><span class="c4">real </span><span class="c0">issue. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are the strongest human knights&mdash;&mdash; and the Holy Knight Order consists of many of these holy knights.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Laplace considers them to be difficult to deal with. The Holy Knight Order does not follow the Holy Empire Ruberios and instead, follows their one true Goddess, Ruminas&mdash;&mdash;In other words, they follow Hinata&rsquo;s every command, as she herself is a disciple of Ruminas.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the reason why the Western Saints Church was able to cut their ties with Holy Empire Ruberios, thus becoming a force of its own. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there was another problem.. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Holy Empire Ruberios&rsquo; military is not exclusively made up of the Holy Knight Order.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is also the regular army of Holy Empire Ruberios, namely the Imperial Guards which serve under the Pope&rsquo;s direct command. This regiment serving the Pope is another difficult organization to deal with.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They preach the saying &ldquo;in God&rsquo;s name, all men are born equal&rdquo;, which allowed them to garner a variety of talents to serve in the Order. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The condition for joining is very straight forward: be a faithful follower of Ruminas and have combat capability above Level A.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The conditions seem simple on paper but are more difficult to achieve in practice, which is why the number of knights in the regiment is so small. However, they are all exceptional fighters or mages, who are allowed to recruit their own subordinates. This is why the Imperial Guards are not a force to be trifled with. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Even within such a powerful organization, Hinata is still said to be head and shoulders above everyone else as the top knight. Moreover,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the archon (leader/highest ranking officer) of the Pope&rsquo;s ministry,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Nicolas Spertus</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;is an admirer of Hinata. With all that in consideration, it can be said that half of the Western Saints Church is firmly under Hinata&rsquo;s control.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The biggest player in both organizations around the Pope, Hinata, refuses to pledge herself to the Pope. Due to people such as Hinata, the relationship between the Western Saints Church and the Holy Empire of Ruberios appears severely twisted nowadays. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">What a difficult woman to deal with&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Having summarized all that information, Laplace sighs with disdain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The holy church is filled with the power of spirits, calling forth the grand holy-element spirits. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such a strong aura of holiness strongly affected the Majin Laplace. His senses seemed to have become reduced, and he wanted to retreat as soon as possible.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace tried to encouraged himself to move on while thinking over his next moves. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He decided to head over to the top of the Spirit Mountain. It holds the &#12300;Inner Sanctum&#12301;which seems to be the place used for communicating with the Goddess. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">While infiltrating the holy church, Laplace&rsquo;s instincts told him that there were some secrets hidden there.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright, what should I do next...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace considered what he should do for a moment and then headed towards the &#12300;Inner sanctum&#12301;across the holy church. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace had been concerned about the amount of time spent investigating, as Hinata would be returning at any moment. But since she wasn&rsquo;t there at the moment, he needed to grab the opportunity to have a sneak peek at the teachings of the the Western Church&mdash;&mdash;The identity of their deity. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">I&rsquo;ll just take a look.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He made up his mind and began to climb up the mountain roads.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, he made the wrong call.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4 c28"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, in terms of results, it was the right decision as it provided incredibly valuable information, but at the same time, it put his life in jeopardy and gave him an unnecessary arduous task.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Using the narrow steps set </span><span class="c4">with</span><sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;stone that led up the mountain, Laplace was able to reach the sanctum at its summit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The sanctum was rather small compared to the Holy Church, yet the two were </span><span class="c4">similar in terms of aesthetics</span><sup><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup><span class="c0">. This small sanctum must have been the real residence of the God.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The surroundings were devoid of any sound.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The holy aura there was much more intense and it pressed against Laplace&rsquo;s body and heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet there was a rather familiar magical aura he sensed in such holy environment. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">&mdash;&mdash;How could this be, Isn&rsquo;t this a holy land?! Why is there presence of </span><span class="c4 c8">magicule</span><span class="c4 c8">s? This is strange, it&rsquo;s really giving me</span><span class="c4 c8">&nbsp;the chills</span><sup><a href="#cmnt8" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup><span class="c4 c8">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The biggest obstacle, Hinata, was indeed not there.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if any other people were around, though he would not take them lightly either way, they would not be dangerous enough to be a threat&mdash;&mdash;Laplace made such judgement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, was it really the right judgement?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With how things were developing, uneasiness started to fill Laplace&rsquo;s heart as he doubted his judgement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">I&rsquo;m thinking too much, I could just go in with full stealth and run away against any overbearing opponent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace thought so to encourage himself and decided to give it a go.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">He carefully enabled his</span><span class="c4">&#12300;Deception Technique&#12301;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt9" id="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup><span class="c0">and was about to go sneaking into the sanctum.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet in a instant&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He &ldquo;seems&rdquo; to have witnessed a light shining through his body. Immediately, the panicked Laplace made his rushed escape to outside of the sanctum.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Useless fool. A trash like you dares to profane the residence of &#12302;God&#12303;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">An incredibly powerful person emerged from the sanctum.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under his dashing clothes, Laplace could vaguely see a strong muscular body.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The short, brilliant blond hair on his head displayed his </span><span class="c4">temperament</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt10" id="cmnt_ref10">[j]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt11" id="cmnt_ref11">[k]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt12" id="cmnt_ref12">[l]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The style of a king. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two canine teeth that stuck out of his mouth were the most eye-catching.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How could this&hellip;.A Vampire&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Shut your trap, trash</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0">. I shall punish you with my own hands. You should feel honored to be killed by my hands!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What followed right after were strafes of red beams, all aimed at Laplace.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">With nowhere to run and no plans of escape, Laplace was beaten to a pulp.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace shivers as he recounts his experience.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That guy sure was strong. I really thought I would die there.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Or rather&hellip;&hellip; why haven&rsquo;t you died yet?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man teases, hearing Laplace&rsquo;s mumbling. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kazaream jests, astonished: &#12300;Eh, you probably can&rsquo;t kill this guy even if you wanted to.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s really annoying; shouldn&rsquo;t ensuring an escape route and one&rsquo;s own safety be common sense? But, I feel as though I&rsquo;ve been getting beat-downs all the time lately. So it&rsquo;s about time for me to act cool for once and show off what I am made of a little.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, yeah. But your role is to be a spy, so I&rsquo;d advise you to not try anything bold.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, Laplace. The goal is the important thing, playing cool is irrelevant, no?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Sure, you are both right. I&rsquo;ll just allow them to beat me more. I may even become a masochist one day.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Why does that matter? It makes no difference if you lose.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, just to live on and win at the last moment is enough. Speaking of which&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kazaream&rsquo;s expression becomes serious upon reaching this point in the conversation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace also nods in response:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes, yes, the more important issue is that he was able to beat the crap out of me, meaning that guy is definitely strong. The question here is that, who really is this guy? Logically, the question is how could such a strong Majin appear in a holy place like that? that&rsquo;s definitely the breaking point. Could this revelation develop into an issue to shake the foundation of Western Saints Church?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Majin&hellip; The Western Saints Church has connections with even Majin, and on top of that, a high ranking Vampire... &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace, as if in sync with the other&rsquo;s thoughts, pushes towards the core issue.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man nods in agreement. However, he is unable to hide the shock on his face at such an unexpected turn of events.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Now this may be an issue. The man who beat Laplace, according to my available knowledge, can&rsquo;t be just a simple Majin.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed, I agree.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, how so?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man responds still full with doubts, despite what Kazaream and Laplace believe..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;m not trying to brag here, but I am strong. For instance, against that Dryad back then, had I fought her earnestly, she wouldn&rsquo;t have stood a chance. I just thought it was disadvantageous to fight in the forest, plus it would get too annoying real fast if she called for backup. That&rsquo;s why I decided to run. There wasn&rsquo;t really any point in fighting her. However, that guy was different. His strength could rival a demon lord. That&rsquo;s why running away was my only choice. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the forest, the Dryads are particularly powerful. Due to their racial attribute, they can teleport to anywhere within the forest instantaneously through the touch of any vegetation within their domain. Not only that, they are able to &ldquo;share&rdquo; all their information among members of their race. That&rsquo;s why under such circumstances, their companions would surely come to her aid. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dryads are a difficult race to deal with, and it&rsquo;s the reason why Laplace had decided to flee. If it was only one Dryad, Laplace would be confident about his victory. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it&rsquo;s different this time. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That guy was a monster. Definitely stronger than me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace asserts with confidence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The air in the room suddenly feels heavier.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I see, a Demon Lord&hellip;.. Kazaream, what do you think?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kazaream sighs.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;As I said&mdash;&mdash;we may be in trouble. To my knowledge, there&rsquo;s only one person that fits the description.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh&#65311; And that would be?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man asks upon seeing that Kazaream is beating around the bush.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Demon Lord Valentine. One of the ancient Demon Lords whose strength rivaled mine when I was in my prime.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, no wonder. If he can fight the president on even footing, fleeing was definitely the right call. I&rsquo;m glad I followed my instincts.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace shrugs as he responds.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He went through all the trouble of infiltrating the Church when Hinata was away, yet encountering a Demon Lord?&mdash;&mdash;His expression tells all the story. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;.......Hmm&mdash;&mdash;The Demon Lord resides within the Western Saints Church. Could it be&mdash;&mdash;that the Pope is in fact Demon Lord Valentine?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Who knows? It&rsquo;s strange that a Demon Lord would seek help from the humans. President, what is this Valentine guy like?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon receiving the gaze of both the young man and Laplace, Kazaream begins to recall the past.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He begins to knock his temple elegantly with his slim fingers, closing his eyes as he recalls a series of events in the past.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Despite how I look right now, I&rsquo;ve survived three of the great wars that have plagued the lands every five hundred years. &nbsp;This certified me as one of the ancient Demon Lords. However, when I formally became a Demon Lord, there were already six others&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Starting with that, Kazaream begins to tell the story.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demon Lord Valentine himself has far more experience as a Demon Lord compared to Kazaream. With immense amounts of power, the title of King of the Undead Vampires is not a title just for show. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Lord Valentine, who himself is the symbol of the undead, has always alarmed Kazaream who had evolved from the long-living elven race to the undead race.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;ve fought against Valentine several times. But never did it amount to anything. When beings like us start fighting, even if we ourselves remain unharmed, our surroundings sustain heavy damages. That&rsquo;s why we began sitting down and talking things over&mdash;&mdash;this later developed into a system which decides on issues based on majority of votes&mdash;&mdash;the Walpurgis Banquet.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;And the reason why any decision would be passed with three votes is a tradition inherited from the time where there&rsquo;s only seven demon lords.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt13" id="cmnt_ref13">[m]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt14" id="cmnt_ref14">[n]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt15" id="cmnt_ref15">[o]</a></sup><span class="c0">&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or perhaps it&rsquo;s because everyone was too lazy to change it&mdash;&mdash;Kazaream laughs elegantly. Kazaream&#39;s voice fluctuates between masculine and feminine, and while it is creepy, the owner of said voice doesn&#39;t seem to notice.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kazaream&rsquo;s smile gives way to a stern look as the story continues:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;d say, as someone who has fought against Valentine, he only ever sees humans and demi-humans as tools . There is absolutely no way that man would go and become a guardian of humanity. &nbsp;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace nods in agreement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man also begins to ponder over Kazaream&rsquo;s words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, then should we make a deal with him?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Come on Laplace. Remember, a deal is something that all parties involved have to agree to.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh yeah&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Knowing that he is not an equal to the other party, Laplace immediately banishes that thought. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;In addition, someone as stubborn as Hinata would never collaborate with a Demon Lord. Which means, the Vampire Laplace encountered must have just been some insignificant Majin instead of the real Demon Lord, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man says, seemingly in agreement with Laplace. However, Kazaream disagrees.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, I&rsquo;m sure that was Valentine. I&rsquo;ve heard of the swaths of red beams attack before, there&rsquo;s no mistaking it. Valentine&#39;s title was &#12302;Overlord of Fresh Blood&#12303;, and he&rsquo;s specialized in the ability &#12302;Blood Flash Shockwave,&#12303; which turns blood into beams of magical particles.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is said that the &nbsp;&#12300;Blood Flash Shockwave&#12301; is a diffusing particle beam. &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It turns one&rsquo;s blood into magical particles and thrusts out as a violent barrage&mdash;&mdash;The only person who has the magicule reserves to pull this off is, without a doubt, Demon Lord Valentine, concludes Kazaream. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;In other words, the Vampire who Laplace fought is most definitely Demon Lord Valentine, but he would never collaborate with humans. If that&rsquo;s true, the only conclusion we can draw is that the Pope must be Demon Lord Valentine, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s possible&hellip;.. and the most logical conclusion to make. But it&rsquo;s still confusing as to how he&rsquo;s able to keep Hinata in the dark about all this.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing the other two hum in agreement, Kazaream also expresses his own agreement. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed, that would be the most reasonable explanation. Although I still have my doubts, there are things that just don&rsquo;t add up&hellip;&hellip; But right now our focus should be the location that Valentine resides, where only the Pope could enter.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He says as he lists out the facts obtained so far.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Let me confirm this again, he is a real Demon Lord, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Most likely. His appearance is rather identical to my recollection. On top of that, Demon Lord Valentine&rsquo;s pride would never allow him to work for anyone but himself&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right, there aren&#39;t many Majin who are stronger than I am. If that kind of monster exists in that place, any investigation in the future may very well be in jeopardy.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Kazaream and Laplace hold the same view, the young man also begins to accept the hypothesis that the Pope could very well be Demon Lord Valentine.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Anyhow, this information is highly valuable. You&rsquo;ve outdone yourself this time, Laplace.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man is definitely elated to have obtained such a trump card to bring down the Western Saints Church. He shows no sign of worry though, even after learning the enemy is backed by a powerful demon lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Based on the newly obtained information, the young man now begins to plan out his next moves. As such, he enjoys the scheming of the coming events&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;My report ends there. By the way, how are things progressing on Clayman&rsquo;s side?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace asks as he suddenly recalls that upon finishing his report.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man shows an annoyed expression of displeasure at the question. He brushes up his shining dark hair and replies with a complaining tone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Well about that&hellip; he messed up.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Did he fail?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah. It was all smooth sailing until we had Hinata duel that slime you mentioned. However, things somehow didn&rsquo;t go according to plan afterwards&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man says as he begins to explain the turn of events briefly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the start, Clayman was successful in converting Demon Lord Milim to his side thanks to the use of the secret jewelry gifted to Clayman by the young man&mdash;&mdash;all thanks to the dominating orb&rsquo;s magic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to examine its effectiveness, he&rsquo;d had to confirm the extent of influence the orb had on Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;And so we decided to have Milim fight an appropriately powerful individual to test out her strength. Demon Lords are all cunning and unfathomably powerful beings, so they decided to use the least intelligent-looking Karion as the test subject. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kazaream also joins the explanation after the young man.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;And to top it off, the capital of Yuurazania could be taken down in the process. There are many ex-human slaves that reside there, and their souls could be used to awake Clayman as a </span><span class="c4">true </span><span class="c0">Demon Lord. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">As they say so, the young man and Kazaream looks at each other and sigh </span><span class="c4">simultaneously</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;To use them for Clayman&rsquo;s awakening...talk about killing two birds with one stone.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But then Milim went out of control and decided to give a war declaration by herself.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the end, Karion and his men got an extra week to prepare themselves, which allowed the people residing within the capital to seek refuge elsewhere.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;As expected, manipulating Demon Lords with magic items is no simple task. We need to make sure to give more detailed commands next time before we try anything else.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You gotta have a bit of faith in me. I&rsquo;m exceptionally good with mind manipulation magic, you know! My title &#12302;Cursed King&#12303; isn&rsquo;t just for show. I made that domination orb myself; it is an incredible piece of magical equipment. The only reason our plan got messed up is because of that incompetent bastard Clayman.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s all water under the bridge at this point now. Anyway, the soul collection plan at Beast Kingdom failed so we set our sights on the Falmas Kingdom.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Falmas Kingdom?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Yeah, that country where they performed the summoning rituals in-house and gathered a number of </span><span class="c4">otherworld</span><span class="c0">ers. And because of that, I thought it was about time to reduce their influence a bit. I secretly found someone to leak some information regarding the Monster Kingdom and caught the interest of that greedy king and his subordinates.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;And given how greedy they are, they bit really hard.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The original plan of creating a new Demon Lord out of the Orc Lord failed spectacularly, so based on Laplace&rsquo;s report they decided on another plan&mdash;&mdash;Instigate the Falmas Kingdom to invade the Jura-Tempest Federation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That Kingdom has several high level Majin and we got to have them kill each other against those otherworlders from Falmas.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It just so perfectly happens that Rimuru, the leader of the country, was acting alone outside his country when Clayman&rsquo;s subordinate infiltrated his nation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru was the ideal bait to draw Hinata out for a fight, the plan is truly killing two birds with one stone. However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But to our surprise, that slime named Rimuru was able to escape from Hinata! This is one slime that we absolutely cannot afford to overlook, just like you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s a rather sharp jab&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;There&rsquo;s even worse things to come&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;In my opinion, Falmas&rsquo;s victory was all but guaranteed. However, once the leader of the </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s gets involved, the situation may very well be turned. But honestly, it makes little difference as to who wins. We&rsquo;ll just have to negotiate with the side that wins. The real objective is to cause enough casualties&mdash;&mdash;and gather souls. And I had thought we&rsquo;d use those souls to help awaken our cute little Clayman, but...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a complete failure.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The grand army of Falmas was completely decimated by a single slime.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Unbelievable right, but it&rsquo;s the truth.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s the first time for me to have my plans derailed like this, even despite my unique skill &#12300;Planner&#12301;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man is very disappointed and Kazaream looks quite angry about it too.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;H-hold on! Taken out by a single </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c4">, how is that even possible? Did Falmas really underestimate the M</span><span class="c4">onster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Kingdom that much!?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace shouts in surprise upon hearing such preposterous claims, to which Kazaream made the following response.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;As I mentioned, the Falmas Kingdom was rather interested. It prepared a huge army of twenty-thousand soldiers consisting of knights and mages. Yet the entire legion was eliminated. As I said, there were no survivors.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehhhh! That&rsquo;s just madness&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace was completely baffled to discover this series of bizarre events. However, more surprising new information awaits.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;What&rsquo;s more, according to Clayman&rsquo;s post-war reconnaissance of the battlefield, he claims that that all the corpses have disappeared. It means that someone has used those corpses as a sacrifice to summon, or create some sort of </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;If I could use all those corpses to create a magic golem, god knows how powerful of a monster could be created? On top of that, those aren&rsquo;t your run of the mill normal corpses; they&rsquo;re all highly trained soldiers. The negative emotions on the battlefield have also created the perfect environment for casting this type of magic. With all of these conditions combined, one can expect to &nbsp;summon monsters that can at least rival a Demon Lord.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is it even possible? The way I see it, it&rsquo;s our loss that we couldn&rsquo;t retrieve the souls. According to Clayman, he couldn&rsquo;t even acquire a single soul at the scene, so his awakening plan is once again in shambles.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Says the young man as he lets out a sigh.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man laments his losses and reflects that the reason for all of this failure was because he has been operating on too many fronts.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Over-emphasizing efficiency and neglecting each individual strategy, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve been failing at every step along the way.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Perhaps I am being too greedy</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;thought the young man.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Could it be that the slime named Rimuru was the one that harvested all those souls?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What nonsense are you suggesting, Laplace? That&rsquo;s a feat beyond even a Demon Lord, so how would a single Majin manage that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kazaream is right.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The collection of 20000 souls, as well controlling them would be a difficult task even for someone skilled in the art of magic. If one is to proceed without considering their own limitations, it will no doubt result in losing control of the souls.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, if someone does pull that off successfully&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hahaha, right, Laplace. If this guy takes twenty-thousand souls in one sitting then he probably evolved into a monster by now, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man smirks at the possibility.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I suppose you&rsquo;re right. I might be overthinking this a bit too much, having too many bad thoughts going through my head.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace&rsquo;s doubts are ridiculed by the other two believing it to be an unfathomable idea.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The conditions necessary to awaken as a True Demon Lord&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s something even Kazaream doesn&rsquo;t know in its entirety. If anything, it will probably require an insane number of souls.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to confirm such hypothesis, they&rsquo;d decided to use Clayman as a lab rat. And Clayman also attempted to experiment using the Orc Lord. However, all of these plans have since, annoyingly, failed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under such circumstances, even someone as calculated as Kazaream could not have expected a slime of all things to, out of nowhere, evolve into a&#12300;True Demon Lord&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Laplace&rsquo;s guess has been right all along, it&rsquo;s just that the three have yet to discover it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Speaking of which, what&rsquo;s Clayman been up to lately&hellip;.?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Having infiltrated the Western Church and almost dying in the process, Laplace thought that Clayman will probably understand his hardship. His eyes drifts off as he asked out of doubts.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;He&rsquo;s currently on standby. As it stands right now, it&rsquo;s better to be acting cautiously. But thanks to Milim doing what she said she would, the Beast Kingdom has now been turned to dust. For now, we&rsquo;ll slow down our pace and reassess our future strategies.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh? So not all of our plans have ended in complete failure?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi oi, are you mocking me, Laplace? Even with most of my power lost, strategizing is still my specialty.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ll be really angry if all my plans just went awry like this! Despite the many setbacks to our plans, we are, at least, still successful in weakening the Falmas Kingdom. Consequently, the Western Nations will be more unified from now on, making it easier for us to control.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;And the Jura Forest can act as defense against invasions from the Eastern Empire.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;I see. So president, if we are going to negotiate with the winning forces, then there&rsquo;s no need to destroy the M</span><span class="c4">onster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Kingdom.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace fully agrees with the two.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Plans that change according to the circumstances to ensure that they are always profitable&mdash;&mdash;These are the abilities possessed by Kazaream&rsquo;s unique skill &#12300;Planner&#12301;. Laplace recalls this and praises it in heart &#12300;He sure has his way.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Milim defeated Karion, which means the domination orb is indeed effective. Our display of power should stop here, and wait to see how the other Demon Lords react.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve ordered Clayman to be on standby. The Eastern Empire is going to take action anyway, so there will be more chances for him to collect souls. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Additionally, the Western Saints Church is also onto the M</span><span class="c4">onster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Kingdom. So keeping that country around should make things more convenient for us.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that&rsquo;s why you two are saying there&rsquo;s no need to rush... Laplace realizes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Which means, our enemy at the moment is just the Western Saints Church?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That would be it for the time being.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;However, things aren&rsquo;t as simple as that. We must assume the enemy forces consists of both saints and Demon Lords, so it would be too dangerous to act without exercising caution.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They don&rsquo;t want to have a direct confrontation with the Church as they want avoid confrontation with the various other forces. Laplace asks if that is the current plan, to which young man nods in agreement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The </span><span class="c4">Monster Kingdom</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;will no doubt become an obstacle after they seize control over the Western Nations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from that, there is another reason.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They must reflect and take to heart the reasons of their continued failure. Next time, they must carefully assess their enemies and avoid taking a double-front approach.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Western Saints Church, and the Holy Empire Ruberios behind it. These are the high priority enemies that they need to strike down first. This time, they need to be cautious and avoid leaving traces&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">This is why it&rsquo;s rather convenient to have the </span><span class="c4">Monster Kingdom</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;around for the time being. By exploiting the Western Saints Church&rsquo;s doctrines, they can have the attention of people such as Hinata to focus on the </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;The Church definitely won&rsquo;t ignore a Majin like Rimuru. After the defeat of the Falmas Kingdom, it&rsquo;s unlikely that they could convince the rest of the Western Nations to wage a holy crusade. But in order to avoid the loss of faith, they will definitely need to make a move.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed. If we are able to intervene somehow and instigate the two parties, they may kill each other off. We just need to wait for both sides&rsquo; strength to decline. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Says the young man with an evil grin.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That Majin alone annihilated 20000 trained soldiers by himself. No one could deal with him except for Hinata. The young man must have concocted many plans waiting for this moment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The arrangement of plans seem to be done. There is not a single sound of hesitation in the young man&rsquo;s voice as he explains them to Laplace.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But the things you reported is beyond our planning Laplace.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah. I can&rsquo;t believe that the Demon Lord Valentine came to mess things up. Could they actually be collaborating? Knowing Hinata&rsquo;s personality, she will never collaborate with a Demon Lord.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both the young man and Kazaream note with a hint of anger. The tone itself is almost like saying that it would be much easier to deal with the Western Church if Demon Lord Valentine was never involved.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s my fault.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Laplace feels rather embarrassed as he tries to find an excuse for himself:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I know, how about we draw out the Demon Lord to remove him from obstructing our investigation?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm? What do you mean, Laplace?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Think about it, we only need to mention it to Clayman and tell him to convene the Banquet. Right now Demon Lord Frey is on his side and so is Milim. Three Demon Lords should be enough to initiate a meeting.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Walpurgis Banquet&mdash;&mdash;As long as the meeting is being held, all the Demon Lords will be be drawn to show up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;I see. In this way we&rsquo;ll be able to draw Demon Lord Valentine out of Ruberios.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man nods with a smile, having accepted Laplace&rsquo;s proposal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, it&rsquo;s rather rare for Laplace to act smart for once. Trying to find an opportunity to lure Hinata out of the holy lands again so your investigation can proceed.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehhh! Why me again?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s only natural.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You don&rsquo;t say?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">Come on, seriously?</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Laplace thinks to himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But neither the young man nor Kazaream seem to care.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, without Laplace&rsquo;s consensus, the Majins begin to draft a new plan.</span></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other Demon Lords did not object to it and the merging process afterwards proceeded smoothly. Everything was unfolding according to Demon Lord Kazaream&rsquo;s precautionary plan which he devised for times like this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman gradually expanded his territory and became a force to be reckoned with as a new Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Among all the Demon Lords, Clayman holds the greatest amount of wealth.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be more specific, Clayman is the only one who knows how to exploit financial situations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s been secretly trading with the Eastern Empire and has established a healthy trade relationship with Dwargon. Through these trading channels, he was able to import the latest models of weapons and armors from the major players from both the east and the west.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is able to use his predecessor&rsquo;s legacy and magic to improve the combat capabilities of his subordinates, as well as recruit Majins who crave power. Clayman is really good at luring Majins by using great wealth and then manipulating them..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only that, but he&rsquo;s been scheming behind the scenes with all the profits gained through his relentless spending. This helped Clayman form a web of connections between different countries, while simultaneously keeping them all in the dark.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything was going according to Clayman&rsquo;s plans, and he had all the information he needed to maintain the control. Thus, his plan of world domination is already halfway complete&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All he lacks now is power, and Clayman is very aware of that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Victory in a war is determined by the number of combatants.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman held such a view, and for that reason, he never put himself on a pedestal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He knows all too well that no matter how much power one can accumulate before a war, there&rsquo;s still a possibility that they will suffer a complete defeat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He thought that Kazaream underestimated his opponent too much. And thus the defeat of that Demon Lord raised a giant red flag in Clayman&rsquo;s heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why he stood firmly in the center of all major powers and cautiously planned his expansion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nowadays, Clayman has finally gained a trump card in terms of strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demon Lord Milim&mdash;&mdash;Her ferocious techniques are second to none, and is able to surpass many of her peers within the Ten Great Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She went to destroy an entire country on her own without a single care, even though Demon Lord Karion is more powerful than Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is very delighted now that he has obtained the strength he always lacked.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wishes full-heartedly to eliminate Demon Lord Leon and believes that he would have his wish granted soon enough.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, before that could happen&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Hehehe, &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo; is truly something. He reached the same conclusion as I did. To have the annoying Saints&rsquo; Church fend off Majin Rimuru. This is the most efficient way to reduce both parties&rsquo; strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He won&rsquo;t have to worry once the enemies begin to kill each other&mdash;&mdash;This was Clayman&rsquo;s plot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">In order to execute the mission of investigating the hidden truths within the Western Saints Church, and to confirm their tie with Demon Lord Valentine&hellip;. All I need to do is to coordinate with Laplace to give him an opening to sneak in once more during the Walpurgis Banquet, when their defense would definitely be slacking. What a perfect plan!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman sips some wine with great joy and appreciates its taste with care.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The taste of the hundred-year wine is definitely worthy of someone of his stature. </span><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s as if he&rsquo;s tasting the amount of work and hardship put into the wine to make it that way.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">It has been strictly maintained as the most classy </span><span class="c4">merchandise</span><sup><a href="#cmnt16" id="cmnt_ref16">[p]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt17" id="cmnt_ref17">[q]</a></sup><span class="c0">, kept in great care until the day someone opens and tastes it&mdash;&mdash;It has been cared for that much, just for Clayman alone to drink it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is only natural to Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is a really graceful king. Thus, only the top quality goods are worthy of him. Clayman has no doubt about that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Now then, what should be the subject of discussion for the Walpurgis banquet&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman thinks as he continues to taste the wine.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The time would be set for the evening one week from now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be the day of new moon, when vampires have the least amount of power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just to be cautious, he has particularly chosen the day when Demon Lord Valentine has the least strength. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The question now is under what name should he summon the demon lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman squints his eyes and tilts his head up, then whispers:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;I should take the chance and attack. Now would be a good time to take all of Karion&rsquo;s territory.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But Clayman, didn&rsquo;t boss tell you to stay put?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the echoing sound questioning him fills up the empty room.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Clayman didn&rsquo;t seem to panic at all, he merely puts on a smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So you are here, Laplace? You are as cunning as always.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No way you didn&rsquo;t realize that. Have you been thinking too hard lately?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hohoho, that can&rsquo;t be helped. I&rsquo;ve had two chances to awaken, yet I&rsquo;ve missed them both due to my miscalculations.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t be so harsh on yourself. The president has already made a prediction that the Eastern Empire would make a move soon!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Perhaps. But Laplace, I&rsquo;ve come up with a good idea. Now that their capital is destroyed, there are many weak races remaining around the territory of the Beast Kingdom. I want to take over Karion&rsquo;s land before any other demon lords, gather all the survivors, and kill them. </span><span class="c4">In terms</span><sup><a href="#cmnt18" id="cmnt_ref18">[r]</a></sup><span class="c0">, I&rsquo;ll get to awaken at long last. So, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree that it is a great plan?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite how Clayman phrased that, Laplace doesn&rsquo;t think highly of it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That sounds rather inappropriate, isn&rsquo;t it a bit too cruel? Wouldn&rsquo;t you be overdoing it if you just kill all those weaklings without even knowing the conditions of awakening?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman isn&rsquo;t pleased with Laplace disagreeing with him and gave him a stern look.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Laplace, that doesn&rsquo;t sound like you at all. Are you sympathizing with them? We follow the rule of survival of the fittest, aren&rsquo;t they lucky that they would die for me? &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But you remember that time you killed thousands of human slaves and it did not change a thing, right? What did that amount to? You can&rsquo;t turn back time once you&rsquo;ve done it, so you&rsquo;d better think things over now and act cautiously.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace is right, Clayman once bought and massacred thousands of slaves, yet he failed to evolve into a &#12300;True Demon Lord&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Clayman is still not convinced even with Laplace pointing out the flaws.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are overthinking it, Laplace. I do whatever I please with my bought goods. If killing a thousand won&rsquo;t do, I&rsquo;ll just have to kill ten thousand. Since I already know it is necessary to have human souls for the awakening, there is no need to show mercy to the weak!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman expresses his arrogant point of view. He also attempts to change Laplace&rsquo;s opinion and continued:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Besides, this type of mission is also beneficial for &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo;. &#12302;A new force has risen in the Great Forest of Jura. In addition, the Lord there dares to proclaim himself a Demon Lord.&#12303; I&rsquo;ve decided to use that as a reason to invoke the Walpurgis Banquet.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, that should work as an excuse. But this proposal doesn&rsquo;t constitute any reason to invade the Beast Kingdom still, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Of course, Laplace. &#12302;During my investigation, my subordinate Myuran was murdered by that guy. That&rsquo;s how we discovered that Demon Lord Karion has betrayed us&#12303;&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s the testimony I&rsquo;d like to give. I&rsquo;ve lost my subordinate, and in the course of collecting evidence I take over Karion&rsquo;s territory. That would be my justification and I bet no one will complain about it.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace begins to assess Clayman&rsquo;s claim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&rsquo;s domain is bordering the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania, so no one would jump out and show any evidence against them. And the fact that Milim has beaten Karion would be the best justification for Clayman to back up his action.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from that, Clayman also demanded Milim to assist him in the investigation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the time he marched his army through Milim&rsquo;s territory to the Beast Kingdom, both sides will not have any objection.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With all of these, the fabrication of evidence would not be an issue.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The plan is almost perfect, yet Laplace still thinks he shouldn&rsquo;t take action just yet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">Aren&rsquo;t you rushing too much, Clayman?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he thinks so, it would be difficult to change Clayman&rsquo;s mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly however, Laplace realizes in shock that he has ignored something important.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s true, it would make sense if you do all these&hellip;&hellip; Eh, hold on a second! Myuran was killed?!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He asks in panic. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace knows Clayman has never treated Myuran well, but he still believes she was a reliable Majin. Among Clayman&rsquo;s subordinate, she&rsquo;s also an important lieutenant among the ranks of the&#12300;Five Fingers&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That Majin isn&rsquo;t great at fighting, but she&rsquo;s a conjurer who thinks and acts fast. She acts as a perfect support role in her line of work. Apart from that, she always looked as if she&rsquo;s unwilling to do her job, which is why Laplace and the others often talk to her in order to encourage her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most important part is that she has a normal set of values despite serving under someone like Clayman. Simply for that reason alone, Laplace commemorates her highly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Clayman&rsquo;s expression remains unchanged as he answers Laplace.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know what you are regretting over, but Myuran has been killed.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Really? I can&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s dead. Are you sure about your source?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh? I inserted &#12302;Dominating Heart&#12303; inside her and that thing is long gone by now. The live heart I kept with me has turned into dust. So I&rsquo;m sure about it. She did just happen to complete her mission before she died, so it was good timing. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Come on now Clayman. You just lost such a capable subordinate. At least try to mourn her for a second, okay?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace is rather sad seeing Clayman&rsquo;s cold reaction and decided to persuade him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">This guy wasn&rsquo;t so terrible before, his personality seems to have been twisted ever since he became a demon lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only Clayman...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of Laplace&rsquo;s companions within the Moderate Clown Troupe began to develop twisted personalities. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace is the same case, so he can&rsquo;t really lecture Clayman about it. Although Laplace is aware of that, he still thinks Clayman has changed a lot compared to before.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hahaha, you are such a nice person Laplace. Tear once told me as well that you should cherish your tools. Didn&rsquo;t you teach her that, Laplace? That&rsquo;s precisely the issue. My tool is broken, so I must punish the one who broke the tool. Wouldn&rsquo;t that comfort the spirit of my tool in heaven?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace decides to give up on the issue after seeing Clayman&rsquo;s evil smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;........you&rsquo;re right. At least don&rsquo;t let her die in vain.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right? I know you would do that.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman grins after saying that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">That&rsquo;s not what I meant&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace has rather mixed feelings seeing that laughing face. But he decides to change his mood and examine whether there are flaws in Clayman&rsquo;s plan or not.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;By the way, Clayman. About the Walpurgis Banquet, would anyone object the meeting?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace expresses his doubts, while Clayman&rsquo;s smile also fades away.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s possible, there will likely be voice of doubts. But right now, I can manipulate Milim however I wish. I&rsquo;ll send her to play with whoever dares to object.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman&rsquo;s expression twists with confidence and greed as he says so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing this, Laplace&rsquo;s face turns white.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Whoa hold on a second, that idea is way too dangerous! That guy also said that Milim may act out of their control anytime. Even though the president made that magical orb himself, you should not be so careless, shouldn&rsquo;t you?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s fine, Laplace. Milim is already following my every order.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve heard of it, but didn&rsquo;t she act on her own and declared a war by herself? The ancient Demon Lords are not an easy feat to manipulate, their resistance against mental control is probably very strong. It will be suicidal if you are going to completely rely on Demon Lord Milim!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace tries his hardest to give Clayman some advice, but he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to any reason.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Are you being jealous that Milim is now in my palm, Laplace?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Not at all! But you should save your trump card for the end game, no?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shut up. I don&rsquo;t need you to worry for me. &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo; wishes to awaken me to become a true demon lord. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll destroy the Beast Kingdom. I&rsquo;ll take care of anyone who dares to stop me!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wait a second! Didn&rsquo;t that guy order the president already to have you stay put? You just need to figure out how to make it through the Banquet now!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace again tries his hardest to convince Clayman, yet all of Laplace&#39;s words slipped through his mind like the wind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Trust me, Laplace. If I only follow Kazaream-sama&rsquo;s plan, I won&rsquo;t complete &ldquo;that Lord&rdquo; &#39;s wishes. Now is the time to strike.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman declares his final stance and decides to end the quarrel with Laplace.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the end, Laplace couldn&rsquo;t stop Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman&rsquo;s views does hold some truth, and it didn&rsquo;t deviate much from the order from above. However, Laplace still finds something wrong with Clayman&rsquo;s plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So he proceeds with:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh, Clayman. I&rsquo;ll ask you one more question. This operation, was it really decided by yourself?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What do you mean by that, Laplace? The only ones that can give me orders are Kazaream-sama and &ldquo;that Lord&rdquo;. You should know that better than anyone, shouldn&rsquo;t you?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s right.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Clayman reassures there is no problem. Laplace won&rsquo;t intervene any further.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, he still has a lot of work to do on his own, such as the second attempt at infiltrating the Western Saints Church.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Fine, that will do. I&rsquo;m leaving. But be careful Clayman! Don&rsquo;t act all reckless without thinking, and you&rsquo;d better not get careless.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After giving that advice, Laplace parts way with Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for Clayman&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Did he think I was under anyone&rsquo;s influence? What a stupid thought. No, could it be&hellip;&hellip; that I&rsquo;ve seized control over Milim&rsquo;s power, and he&rsquo;s afraid that I would take his reward? But being jealous isn&rsquo;t really Laplace&rsquo;s style&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman hasn&rsquo;t been over-confident with his ability.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Right now, he&rsquo;s gained an additional set of ego to boost himself with, having controlled over Demon Lord Milim. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt19" id="cmnt_ref19">[s]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why he said those words to his most trusted friend, Laplace. That&rsquo;s also why Clayman thought Laplace was jealous of himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">While feeling somewhat disappointed towards his friend, Clayman took another sip of his red wine. It tastes bitter and lacks the </span><span class="c4">smooth sweetness</span><sup><a href="#cmnt20" id="cmnt_ref20">[t]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt21" id="cmnt_ref21">[u]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;just now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">&mdash;&mdash;Annoying!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He suddenly throws the glass in his hand towards the wall. Due to a feeling he himself can&rsquo;t describe, he just wants to express his anger using whatever objects happened to be near him. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The classy wine bottle that was placed on the table is shattered into pieces now. Even so, Clayman doesn&rsquo;t really mind. He decides to take something out of his pocket in order to calm himself down.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a piece of mask.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A mask with a smiling face engraved on.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t worry, Laplace. I&rsquo;ll awaken successfully. Then, I will dominate this world . No, Laplace. I won&rsquo;t lose anything else! This time, we will be together. We will live our life together&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;In an empty room with only himself, Clayman mumbles his deepest desires that has been buried in his heart</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He caresses the mask lightly as if it&rsquo;s an important piece of treasure&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We need to defeat Demon Lord Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That objective is now settled.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That bastard is still hiding somewhere in the dark, we&rsquo;ve got to take care of him sooner or later.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I am to become a Demon Lord, it would be unavoidable to involve other Demon Lords in that process. With that being the case, Clayman would be the best candidate for my flesh sacrifice.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now I&rsquo;ve got no idea why Milim provoked Karion, and there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a way to persuade her. I guess I&rsquo;ll brag about my power in order to avoid future grievances.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, Clayman has crossed the line this time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Karma will bite back&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c5 c4">I&rsquo;ll make him pay for his evil deeds.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">About our future plans.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Youmu has gained massive popularity in the Kingdom of Falmas with the title of the champion. I&rsquo;ve decided to exploit that and release our captive, the Falmas King to engage in post-war negotiation. This would facilitate us in gaining control of Falmas.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We also need to respond to the Western Saints Church, and declare our nation&rsquo;s stance to every country we&rsquo;ve encountered.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That would be a lot of business to discuss.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;ll likely be a rather busy meeting after this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But let&rsquo;s hear Souei&rsquo;s report first.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It looks like Clayman has been on the move lately, I need to listen to it in detail again and hold a post-war conference. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve brought my subordinates from the Tempest Federation alongside the three Beastketeers to the big conference room. However&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My &#12300;Universal Perception&#12301;has detected a party of around fifty people approaching our town.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm... That would probably be the head of the Brumund branch of the Freedom Association, Fuze.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It didn&rsquo;t take long before Fuze was escorted to me by the guards. He was quite dramatic in trying to break through the soldiers&rsquo; defense line to talk to me about something.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Long time no see, Rimuru-san. I&rsquo;m glad I made it in time. According to the security pacts between Kingdom of Brumund and Tempest Federation, I&rsquo;ve come to your aid. I was terrified that we would arrive too late.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze smiles as he finishes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, he seems rather nervous, and the soldiers following him seem to be nervous as well. Everyone&rsquo;s eyes show the resolve to sacrifice themselves.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing how they all are armed to the teeth, I can tell that they&rsquo;re prepared for war.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What&rsquo;s wrong? The head of Freedom Association branch himself comes to me, what do you guys plan to d&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Haha, now now. I&rsquo;ve left the duties to Higis. And about the merchants&mdash;&mdash;especially Myourmiles, has informed me about the situation in the town. I heard you guys&rsquo; have been fighting against Kingdom of Falmas so&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Hmm? Hmmhmmhmm?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that I think about it, it&rsquo;s been ten days since I sent back the guests from Kingdom of Brumund.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So did the head of the Branch hear the report and decide to come to assist us in battle?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case I appreciate it, but&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Even if it&rsquo;s too late to start deploying the defense line, we should deploy soldiers around the town to fortify our defenses. It seems that the main force of Falmas Military has yet to arrive, we also have no idea when the advanced forces would arrive. After all, we&rsquo;ve long exceeded the deadline they declared&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze tries his hardest to explain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, with what I suspect is the firm look of someone that is ready to embrace death, he finishes his words in a go.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">There&rsquo;s no </span><span class="c4">suspicion</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;anymore, he really has made up his mind. And he mentioned he has left all his duties to Higis, it seems that he truly wants to defend this town.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, about that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">The war has ended already.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Fuze&rsquo;s expressing his views all enthusiastically, I couldn&rsquo;t really say that at his face right now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Do you intend to breach through their frontline? That would be hard though. According to our intel, the enemy has roughly twenty thousand soldiers. You definitely can&rsquo;t win by going head to head with them. However, I contacted some of my old friends and arranged to have three hundred adventurers on hold. These men may be small in number, but we will fight with everything we&rsquo;ve got. We&rsquo;ve prepared to fight a protracted war and will even conduct guerrilla warfare using the forest&rsquo;s landscape&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is it really alright to come and assist us like this? That would be unnecessary to ask considering how much Fuze indeed cares for us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;and being able to fight alongside the beastmen has really reassured me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze continues to throw out his art of war by himself. Now I am in a difficult spot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of the my subordinates look shocked whereas the Beastketeers also have no idea how to respond.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That can&rsquo;t be helped, though. Since everyone here knows the war is over.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, I honestly didn&rsquo;t think he would come to our aid.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though we&rsquo;ve made a pact that aimed to avoid aiding us with military, he still came as fast as he could with as many soldiers he could gather.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That does please me a little bit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, we&rsquo;ll put that aside for now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;This town is amazing. The street looks beautiful, accompanied by well constructed houses. You&rsquo;ve got stone-paved roads and though I don&rsquo;t want to admit, this is much more majestic than Brumund. I know you don&rsquo;t want to lead it into a battlefield, but right now we must endure and wait for the reinforcements! The Brumund King has already decided to dispatch the Knight order, all we need is a little more time to prepare&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;AH&mdash;&mdash;Fuze-kun. Let&rsquo;s pause right there.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I decided to interrupt him there.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m really sorry for these circumstances, but I won&rsquo;t be able to improve the situation if I don&rsquo;t interrupt him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What&rsquo;s wrong Rimuru-san? Have you come up with a battle plan?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, hmm. N-not really a battle plan&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Do you mind sharing it with us? In your defense, I know it&rsquo;s normal for you to suspect us, but right now I really hope you can trust&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;NO, NOT LIKE THAT FUZE-KUN! I&rsquo;m glad you are worried, but the war has already ended!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh? Ended? Wha? What do you mean?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm&mdash;&mdash;how should I put it&hellip;&hellip; In summary, I just eliminated them all.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;EHHHH? What did you eliminate? Eliminate</span><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;What do you mean by that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze couldn&rsquo;t process what he just heard and begins to question me back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t really blame him for having this sort of reaction.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, I mean-I mean the army of Falmas, I&rsquo;ve defeated them all!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh...EHHHHHH&mdash;&mdash;!?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He utters a weird noise and freezes on the spot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Youmu begins to pat on Fuze&rsquo;s shoulder while Cabal comes forth to comfort him. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Elen and Kido who stood by them starts to tell him along the line of&#12300;This whole thing is indeed quite unbelievable.&#12301;,&#12300;It&rsquo;s really </span><span class="c4">exaggerating</span><sup><a href="#cmnt22" id="cmnt_ref22">[v]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt23" id="cmnt_ref23">[w]</a></sup><span class="c4">&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since it has been less than two weeks before the enemy has declared war on us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His prediction was&mdash;&mdash;It will take roughly a week for the main force to arrive. So they will spend two to three days to clear out the enemies in the surrounding area of the battlefield to buy time and deploy a defense perimeter around the city and brace for the worst.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In his view the war has already broken out, and our lack of defense seems to have confused Fuze.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that he ran into everyone all gathered in the same place, he thought we were going to launch an attack altogether.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To think that the battle has already ended instead of the Falmas army arriving late&mdash;&mdash;Having been told something like that, anyone would have a hard time accepting it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve sent my humble son Rigur as messenger to Brumund a few days ago. It would seem you have missed him. It&rsquo;s just as what Rimuru-sama said, the war is over.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rigurdo comes forth to clarify with Cabal and Elen supplementing the details. Then Fuze finally accepted the fact.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he still continues to mumble &#12300;How is that possible&hellip;.&#12301;, it would take some time for him to digest the information.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fifty soldiers who came along him are also dumbfounded, so I told my guards to have them rest at our inn since they all seem extremely tired, even to the point where they could faint any second now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, they must have relaxed, having just been told the war is already over. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to avoid the army of Falmas, they chose to march through the forests instead of the main roads. Marching with a full set of armour and gear in the forest is surely a hard job.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The soldiers expressed their gratitudes and were escorted away by my guards.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The only one left is Fuze, who now has a rather tired expression on his face.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Fuze, how about you go get some rest as well?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah&hellip;. You are right. I&rsquo;m still confused at the moment, I should probably get some rest&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze nods in response and decides to head towards the inn&hellip;&hellip;. Yet the timing was unfortunate, as some new visitors just arrived.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, more visitors, and they are&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;More visitors? What about them?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze stops out of curiosity at my words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is due to him stopping that he&rsquo;s lost his chance to rest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the Dwarf King himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel Dwargo.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I just discovered something. My skill &#12300;Magic Perception&#12301;has evolved to &#12300;Universal Perception&#12301;. The radius of my detection has largely increased, and it has boosted the accuracy as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was able to detect the Legion of Pegasuses that&rsquo;s still quite some distance away from the town.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Announcement. Thirty pegasus knights have been detected closing in on the perimeter. Confirmed Leading individual: Gazel Dwargo. &#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My ultimate skill &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301;reports to me nonchalantly. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem due to the boost it received in accuracy, it can identify individuals I encountered in the past.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s a convenient skill indeed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that being said...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is a bit too much information apart from the activities within the town.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Honestly&mdash;&mdash;I was going to complain about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">For that reason, I hope you could simplify the content of the report, &#12300;Great Sage&#12301;..... No, I should call it Raphael-san.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be more specific, you can report whoever intends to approach me in a harmful way.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;.....Understood&mdash;&mdash;&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems to want to say something. But it&rsquo;s fine, I just need to pass on all the trouble to it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have faith in it. That&rsquo;s how Raphael-san works.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I compressed my skill to minimum capacity and waited quietly for the guests to arrive.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since they&rsquo;ve already been identified by my skill, whoever has arrived can&rsquo;t be imposters. They must be the real deal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t have time to inform Fuze before the Pegasus knights landed before us. Immediately after, Gazel got off the back of his pegasus, and says to me with a laugh:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Long time no see, Rimuru. I heard rumours that you&rsquo;ve become a Demon Lord, am I right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No wonder that the king himself came here. Of course he is here to talk about that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I suppose, Gazel. A lot happened, so I decided to become a Demon Lord. It is quite complicated, but I&rsquo;ll be drafting a series of plans.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I greet him with such words, giving him a wry smile and informing him of our meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Perfect timing. Then I&rsquo;ll join in the conference too.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel proclaims rather naturally.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze still looks all battered up, but his expression suddenly changes as he closes in on me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Demon Lord&hellip;..? What in the world is going on?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He happened to be around to hear our conversation. He probably thought this type of thing just can&rsquo;t be ignored and questioned me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that to him...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now it would only make things messier, but if I remain silent now, Fuze won&rsquo;t give up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-san, I can&rsquo;t just unhear what you just said! I did hear you say something about how you&rsquo;ve become a Demon Lord, right&hellip;&hellip;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze shivers as he says so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is he holding his pee? Go ahead and do it, don&rsquo;t be so polite with me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Do you need to pee? If so, our town&rsquo;s public toilet is&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;NO! Who said that I want to go to the toilet!? It&rsquo;s not about that, it&rsquo;s about you becoming a Demon Lord&hellip;. What in the world is going on&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I intended to use the toilet as an excuse, but failed to get it through to Fuze.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze also is no longer acting all respectfully to me and is showing his true colours.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, Oh, you mean the thing about the Demon Lord? I am one, yeah,&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I answer casually and pretend it&rsquo;s not a big deal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s clear he won&rsquo;t let me off the hook so easily though.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hahaha, that&rsquo;s such a bad joke. I do hope you can answer this seriously.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Eh&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c5 c4">Annoying. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does he wish me to tell him from the start? Do we have to do it from the start? Well, King Gazel also seems intrigued to learn about it...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But talking while standing isn&rsquo;t really convenient, so I should just make an explanation real quick.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I roughly recite the story to them. As a result, Fuze starts to talk to the air. It seems he&rsquo;s trying to escape reality by going catatonic. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh well, At least it&rsquo;s better than having him chanting doubts about my story all day.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I decide to leave Fuze alone and talk to King Gazel again.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;By the way, Gazel, is it really alright if a king of a nation just departs </span><span class="c4">it like this</span><sup><a href="#cmnt24" id="cmnt_ref24">[x]</a></sup><span class="c0">.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That actually does concern me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am equally guilty of the same crime, but King Gazel seems way too liberal with how he visits other countries.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dwarven Kingdom&mdash;&mdash;The Armed Nation Dwargon is a powerful nation. Its national savings alone would be dozens times more than my country&rsquo;s. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Would it really be okay if the King just moved out like this?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh, no problem. I&rsquo;ve got a body double!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eh? You seem to be using your body double in the wrong place&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, or is it?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Something doesn&#39;t feel right, but I suppose that&rsquo;s how it is.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Pegasus commander Deruf-san as well as the companions of the hero king have all arrived. That&rsquo;s one strong group of people to bring.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s not important, Rimuru, is it true what Vesta reported to me three days ago?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel switches his eyes to those unique to a nation&rsquo;s ruler and questions me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s true, those twenty thousand&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hold on a second, Rimuru. I&rsquo;ve heard that the Falmas army has vanished for no reason. Do you know anything about this?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, vanished?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm? What is this now?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Vesta reported to </span><span class="c4">b</span><span class="c0">e that the army of twenty thousand men closing in on this town suddenly disappeared. What actually happened?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel slowly says that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A pair of eyes have been staring at Vesta in the corner, exerting unseen pressure on him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I look towards Vesta and see him shaking his head in panic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Vesta, I was there during your report as well. You did mention that the Falmas army suddenly vanished. We were curious and thus decided to come investigate. Did you find the reason for that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pan is the highest commander in chief of the Dwargon army as well as King Gazel&rsquo;s close ally. He also uses a pressing tone to question Vesta.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, I get what&rsquo;s going on.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel is trying to cover up the fact that I massacred the twenty thousand men army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Well, about that, we couldn&rsquo;t get to the bottom of it...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vesta also seems to understand what they mean and answered carefully. He&rsquo;s been looking at Gazel and the rest&rsquo;s expressions and cleverly coordinated the conversation alongside them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">I suppose that&rsquo;s how smart people do things. Vesta&rsquo;s reflexes are super fast. Now the mess I left has been successfully covered up.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt25" id="cmnt_ref25">[y]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel instead lowers his voice and whispers to me: &#12300;Idiot! If you tell the truth now, you are making yourself an enemy of the humans!&#12301; and similarly as such along the lines of &#12302;don&rsquo;t bother yourself to make an enemy with the humans even though they will definitely fear you.&#12303;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It does make sense when I think about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Someone powerful enough to single-handedly wipe out army of more than ten-thousand people. That&rsquo;s more deadly and horrifying than nuclear weapons.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The less people who know the truth, the better. There really isn&rsquo;t any need for unrelated countries and citizens to be informed about this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The army of Falmas Kingdom attempted to invade the </span><span class="c4">Monster Kingdom</span><span class="c0">, yet encountered an unknown accident, leading to their disappearance as a whole&mdash;&mdash;We will package this as the truth and inform the rest of the countries of it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I see that Sasuga-King Gazel possesses the ability to deal with crises, a skill that I lack</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So the only problem remaining is just what I&rsquo;ve said.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be too late to hide it from the people in the town. But the truth doesn&rsquo;t really matter to them. Everyone probably knows about it but no one would go around and run their mouth about the news.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze happens to be the center of my concern.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I glance towards him. He has regained consciousness and our eyes happen to meet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, ah&mdash;&mdash;Fuze-kun.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-san&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right, what should I do now?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just now I broke the breaking news to him that the entire Falmas army has been killed by my hands.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Should I tell him that all of this is just nonsense?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">While I was still worrying, Fuze takes in a breath and sighs.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he raises both of his hands and respond:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything. Of course, my men are all resting at the inn now, and they definitely won&rsquo;t remember when they wake up tomorrow morning. We are so tired that they probably hallucinated and forgot everything.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem he decided to pretend he hasn&rsquo;t heard anything.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze seems to have suddenly aged a lot, to the point that his entire body seems to be devoid of strength. There is a certain tragedy to this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, he was being so nice to have resorted to this in order to resolve the issue.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Gufufufufu, if that&rsquo;s the case, just to be cautious, allow me to confirm it.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man who&rsquo;s interrupted suddenly out of nowhere is Diablo, who now stands behind me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">This Diablo is an amazing guy, too. He&rsquo;s like Doraemon,</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and answers to your every need.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He also seems interested in doing chores.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I also recall hearing him whisper that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;good at rewriting memory&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll pretend I never heard that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze still seems troubled, but he gave in at last. He won&rsquo;t intervene as long as his subordinates are kept safe and uninformed of the knowledge. He must have also agreed to King Gazel&rsquo;s view that the less people who know this, the better.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as national interest is involved, he may dispose of whoever leaks out the information in the worst case scenario. That&rsquo;s why he believes it is better to just let things slide this time with an eye closed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I won&rsquo;t look further in about your subordinate, but do include me in the meeting. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze also suggests his own view, and says there&#39;s no negotiation with his term.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He probably thinks whatever is in the meeting cannot be simply ignored. You can tell from the determination in his eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright then. But I hope you all will trust me as well. I don&rsquo;t have any intention to antagonize humanity. So I won&rsquo;t stop you from attending the meeting.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I shrug after finishing the sentence and agreed to let Fuze join the meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rigurdo escorts Fuze to the lounge.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Gazel&rsquo;s party also wishes to join the meeting, we have to tide up the meeting hall. Because of that, I want to have Fuze rest for now as much as possible.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing all this, Gazel questions me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh, are you sure that man is trustworthy, Rimuru?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;He is, it&rsquo;s all good here.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze is indeed a trustworthy man. I answer with confidence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm. If that&rsquo;s the case, those people would be the only issue now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said, Gazel gazes menacingly behind us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eh, are there people there?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turn my back in surprise and discover a group of strangers in front of me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A gentleman in expensive clothings who is quite handsome. He must have been really popular in his prime.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man has a rather unique pair of long and narrow eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are five other people who look like highly ranked military general that stand by the two sides of this gentleman. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can tell they have received good trainings.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I didn&rsquo;t even notice with them being so close&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could this be, my &#12300;Universal Perception&#12301;didn&rsquo;t react at all&mdash;&mdash;!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m rather panicked when this thought raises over me. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer. There is no hostility detected from this group of people.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raphael-sama rather unpleasantly informs me. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, right, I see.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;.Ugh, this one is really on me. Just now I was complaining about receiving too much information.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, my rather vague request of letting Raphael distinguish those who wish harm on me was quite unreasonable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t blame&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301;for being mad.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sorry! In the future I hope you&rsquo;ll just report everything as it is&mdash;&mdash;I apologize from the bottom of my heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is rather embarrassing to apologize to my own skill, but it is the intent that matters.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not noticing what I&rsquo;ve been doing, Gazel continued to converse with the mysterious group.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Where did you all come from?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What a coincidence! Aren&rsquo;t you the king that likes to hide and live underground? What a surprise. I never expected chicken like you would come in aid of a &#12302;Demon Lord&#12303;....&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">That man is rather at ease with his attitude even with Gazel&rsquo;s imposing </span><span class="c4">haki</span><sup><a href="#cmnt26" id="cmnt_ref26">[z]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s clearly trying to provoke Gazel, and the generals around him also look quite irritating as if they are saying &#12300;I really can&rsquo;t stand this.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;The coward would be you. You idiot elven offspring who likes to stay on high ground. Have you finally decided to visit the mortal realm from the City of God tree? &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel seems to have seen through the act and hence disarmed his alert. Instead, he laughed smugly and teased the man back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the looks of it, Gazel and the man knew each other.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Raphael&rsquo;s reaction was right in that he holds no hostility. Maybe it&rsquo;s just that Gazel and the man can&rsquo;t get along with each other. However, that may be too much considering the two just seem like friends who love bad-mouthing each other.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama, they seem to be the messengers from Sorcery Dynasty Sarion.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The one who reported to me is Souei&rsquo;s subordinate Souka. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I heard he is responsible for leading these guests here. After that guy found out Gazel was present here too, he then decided to come and spice things up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You just never change, Elalude.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two both give one another an awkward look and greet each other.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That seems to be their special way of greeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, so who is this young lady&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, nice to meet you, I am the leader of this forest, Rimuru. I look forward to our future encounter. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This narrow eye man&mdash;&mdash;Elalude has laid his eyes on me, so I decided to greet him a bit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I should have welcomed him in a more proper ceremonial way considering he&rsquo;s a messenger from Sorcery Dynasty Sarion. Despite that, I&rsquo;ve got no clue about the customs and elegancy of the such a ceremony.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though I&rsquo;ve become a Demon Lord, I still can&rsquo;t find experts in that field.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I guess it&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;ll just have to find an expert to enlighten me another time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">As I greet him, Elalude suddenly became </span><span class="c4">fidgety</span><sup><a href="#cmnt27" id="cmnt_ref27">[aa]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He started to shout with his eyes opened wide.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So it is you! You are the Demon Lord that kidnapped my daughter! I hope you&rsquo;ve prepared yourself for what&rsquo;s coming!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">As soon as he finished, he began to conjure a </span><span class="c4">Greater Explosive Flame spell</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and starts the chanting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oi oi, could you be any less reckless, mister?! </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to my knowledge, Special Greater Explosive Flame spell is one of the most difficult type of magic to conjure.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Fire is one of elemental-based magic and its spells range from Fireball all the way to Giant Magic Fireball. It becomes more difficult to control as the spell becomes more powerful. There are then more powerful spells such as Giant Magic Flame Barrier or Giant Magic Flame Storm that are very difficult to conjure. All in all, the difficulty of casting increases naturally with the power and scale of the spell.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, let&rsquo;s just analyze the name of spell casted by this Mister Elalude&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Special Greater Explosive Flame spell, to put it simply, is a synthesized magic spell.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It contains Fire spell that can burn and the Explosive spell that could blow away the target&mdash;&mdash;By combining the two branches of spell, one can sublimate the two into a higher level of Explosive Flame Magic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of that, it happens to be the type of magic wielded by Shizu-san.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The difference is that Shizu-san relied also on the power of Ifrit. It&rsquo;s quite difficult to control a spirit if you aren&rsquo;t a conjuring expert such as Shizu-san. But, as long as you establish a trusting relationship with the spirit, it will help out in times of need and hence help control the power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So in contrast, when we talk about Special Greater Explosive Flame&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a very dangerous spell when one relies on himself to control the magic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, this type of magic is not limited by the magic system itself, so there is a lot of freedom in its usage.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The casting speed, accuracy, power, scale, area of effect, duration of effect; one can freely distribute the spell&rsquo;s magnitude in all of these major elements. If he chooses to pursue purely power, it would be a piece of cake for him to cause havoc on the town.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But of course, this also increases the risks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Conjuring spells require magicules, as well as sufficient concentration of mental abilities in order to gather the required amount. If the conjurer is incapable of doing that, the magic would not be cast. In addition, once the casting failed, the remained magicules could go out of control and turn the nearby area to a wasteland.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So it makes sense that why very few people actively practice such dangerous spells. Usually, only those who&rsquo;s obtained a rank higher than a magician could use these high level spells for military purpose.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">And you </span><span class="c4 c8">definitely </span><span class="c0">shouldn&rsquo;t cast it in a town like this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet that&rsquo;s exactly what Elalude is planning to do.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What the hell is he doing. Acting like this out of nowhere.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He accused me of kidnapping his daughter, but what in the world is that suppose to mean?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although I still haven&rsquo;t been able to react, there isn&rsquo;t much need to be nervous.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">There is a loud tearing sound that goes </span><span class="c4 c8">Siiiii</span><span class="c4">&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c0">on the scene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">What came at the same time was Elen&rsquo;s </span><span class="c4">shouts</span><sup><a href="#cmnt28" id="cmnt_ref28">[ab]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Waiiit, Dad! What are you doing here!?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She came here angrily and realized the situation immediately. She then gave Elalude a chop on the head without saying a thing to him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elen&rsquo;s arrival finally got Elalude&rsquo;s senses back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it would seem this Elalude is actually Elen&rsquo;s father. He is finally settling down after he got scolded by an angry Elen.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These type of people sure are troublesome for having such short temper. The image of a reasonable gentleman he built when he was talking to Gazel was completely toppled with his later actions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehh&mdash;&mdash;Ahaha. Sorry, someone told me my daughter has been kidnapped by a Demon Lord. So I kinda panicked just now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He says so while laughing out delightfully.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But you can&rsquo;t just cast an Special Greater Explosive Flame spell on the town just like that! You are one daddy-gone-berserk.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, sir. I&rsquo;ve told you the facts as they are. It was your own misunderstanding.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Of course! It&rsquo;s all dad&rsquo;s fault!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A secretary-looking person corrects Elalude calmly and Elen thus continues to blame him harshly, causing him look horrible.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He does look rather pitiful like that but I can&rsquo;t sympathize with him. It&rsquo;s his own doing. I hope Elen will blame him more so he can reflect a little bit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;You still spoil your daughter like always, Elalude.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel comments at Elalude as the situation got slightly calmer.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Elalude doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any regrets and argues back:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;m not spoiling her. It&rsquo;s all because Elen-chan is too cute and I can&rsquo;t help myself&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That is the dictionary definition of spoiling&hellip;&hellip;..Never mind, it won&rsquo;t help even if I say anything.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel is dumbfounded. It seems that&rsquo;s how Elalude acted before.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s probably no cure for him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing that Gazel and Elalude have finished their conversation, Elen decided to slip in and greet Gazel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Long time no see, King Gazel.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elen said as such. She seems to give off the attitude of a noble despite her adventurer outfit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is it really Elen-chan? I didn&rsquo;t recognize you at first. Hope you are doing fine. It&rsquo;s really been a long time, you&rsquo;ve become prettier.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel greeted back, then Elalude starts to get all noisy and complains: &#12300;Are you a pedophile? You better watch your back, Gazel!&#12301;Thankfully, Elen immediately gave him a savage chop on the head, accompanied by the secretary-looking guy shutting his mouth up with hand in order to prevent him from further bad mouthing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel seemed rather used to it and simply shrugged it off without any comment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This guy seems to get very heated in the head whenever the topic was related to Elen. He usually acts gentle and cultured, but has a large dichotomy at times. I&rsquo;ll note that for precaution.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-san, this here is my father, Duke of Sorcery Dynasty Sarion, Elalude Grimwald.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Leader of Jura Great Forest, ruler of </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">, my daughter Elen has introduced us. My name is Elalude Grimwald. Please call me Elalude.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that, Elen introduced her father Elalude to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t expect this man to be the head of the Sarion Duke&rsquo;s family. It seems the messenger from Sarion is not an insignificant man. I&rsquo;ve heard rumors that he is a relative of the Emperor, and is in fact, the emperor&rsquo;s uncle. No wonder he got to chat with Gazel so casually, since he is indeed qualified. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be perfectly clear, he is one of the top three most powerful persons in the Sorcery Dynasty Sarion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That gave me quite the shock.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">T-then Elen would be a super prominent daughter of a noble.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve heard of her noble origin, but such prominent origin is really something else&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">It won&rsquo;t be too much to address her as Mademoiselle</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c0">. A noble with such prominence deciding to become an adventurer&hellip; she may have been too liberal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I shouldn&#39;t be the only one thinking so, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps there are people secretly protecting her. She seemed to already know when she told me about the Demon Lord awakening that her leaking that information would have been exposed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cabal and Kido, these two followers must have a hard time accompanying her. I have to find a chance to compensate them&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, right now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#12300;So, did you come here just for Elen-san?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s probably not that simple.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought to myself and looked towards Elalude.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehehe, of course not. I came here to discuss diplomatic relations with your country, as well as to confirm things with my own eyes. To check out who the mythical Slime really is and why my daughter took such a liking to you. It&rsquo;s quite unbelievable to witness your menacing aura as a leader despite the fact that you are actually a slime. But still, I wanted to test your ability. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude gives off an evil smile after saying so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why he casted that spell, to intentionally test us as it would seem.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru, Shuna and Shion are all on hold next to me. My officers all did not fringe while facing off the danger. But that is only natural as they&rsquo;ve all predicted that he won&rsquo;t cast the spell. They&rsquo;ve grown a lot since they would likely have lost their temper if it was the old them. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve analyzed the spell you were going to cast, but it was obvious that your magicule count did not meet the basic requirement.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna says so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems his bluff has been seen through, Elalude also throws a wry smile to tease.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;My my, now I&rsquo;ve been exposed of my incompetency.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, it&rsquo;s really something how you&rsquo;ve controlled the speed of your casting to mislead others in believing the magic is going to be casted. It&rsquo;s very admirable how you are able to utilize that homunculus body of yours so thoroughly. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing Elalude mocking himself, Shuna responds gently. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh? That&rsquo;s surprising. Have you found out that this body is artificial?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes. It would seem you&rsquo;ve inserted your astral body into it. The famous technology of the Sorcerer Dynasty Sarion surely lives up to its fame as the nation with endeavour of magic. Very impressive.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing Shuna&rsquo;s wods, I also try to run an &#12300;Appraisal&#12301;. Indeed, out of the entire group, only Elalude is using a homunculus body. It would seem that it is part of the effort to protect such a famous noble.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I thought he didn&rsquo;t bring enough guards when he came to meet someone who claims to be Demon Lord. If I think that way, dwarf king Gazel is the exception.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But anyway, the homunculus is so skillfully crafted that it looks realistic enough to be indistinguishable from real people.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once we&rsquo;ve settled our business here, I need to ask him to teach me the techniques.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude mentioned that his intent is to assess the diplomacy between our countries. But that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the only thing on his mind. I suppose we will figure out later, there&rsquo;s no need to rush out for an answer.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps I should invite Elalude to the meeting as well for him to make further judgements.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I also wish to hear what&rsquo;s his opinion on the future policies our country may adapt, it will be a great opportunity. But it depends on the result of the meeting. It is possible that even Sarion may become hostile to us. However, if things really go down that path, I&rsquo;ll have to deal with it then.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobuta came to inform us that the preparations for the meeting are completed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was planning to discuss things with my own subordinates but I don&rsquo;t seem to have the opportunity right now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only so, we are heading straight to the official meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was planning to prepare information on the countries beforehand to better inquire them. That&rsquo;s how a diplomat would often do to engage first, observe each others&rsquo; interests and conflicts so as to reach a common ground.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since we&rsquo;ve not done any rehearsal beforehand, everyone will just have to express their genuine views.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our future would be dependent on this meeting. If we fail to reach an agreement, it is no exaggeration that it will lead to war.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I boost my own spirit and head towards the meeting room.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, the essential meeting that would decide the future of the Jura-Tempest Federation now begins.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&mdash;&mdash;This meeting would be bestowed with a legendary status, and historically known as the Meeting between Human and </span><span class="c4">Monster</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I enter the meeting room and see everyone standing, awaiting my arrival.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are the three Beastketeers, Fuze, King Gazel and Duke Elalude. The VIPs of each country are directed to their special seats and are seated.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After they sat, I walked towards the most inner seat &nbsp;while everyone sat down rather unanimously. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The meeting is commenced in a solemn environment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">First off, we need to introduce all the participants of the meeting. After all, there are many members here who came from strong nations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of us know them, but in order to avoid any disrespect, it&rsquo;s best to introduce everyone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, we begin to introduce the guests</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Well then, we shall introduce the guests.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Following my look, Shuna understood my order and begins to announce the names.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beast Kingdom Yuurazania. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The spokespersons consisted of the three Beastketeers who represent the Beast King&rsquo;s army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thinking about it, Phobio and Suphia are rather&mdash;&mdash;let&rsquo;s just say&mdash;&mdash;single-minded. So we should probably prioritize Alvis&rsquo; opinions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dwarven Kingdom&mdash;&mdash;The Armed Nation of Dwargon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spokesperson is the King himself&mdash;&mdash;Gazel Dwargo.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was just trying to hide the fact that I wiped out a twenty thousand-men sized army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He may be planning something else though. So I&rsquo;d better factor that in to accommodate his op.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s may be doing me a lot of favor this time as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kingdom of Brumund.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, this nation did not send an official representative. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Fuze is the head of the Freedom Association Branch in Brumund, plus he&rsquo;s closely related to Baron Bayette who is a minister of Brumund Kingdom, he should have the same rank of authority to him. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s undoubtedly the best representative they can choose. I should really listen to his precious opinions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next one is Sorcery Dynasty Sarion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They suddenly came to participate, yet the head of the group is the famous noble Duke Elalude.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude is the dumb father who spoils his daughter, but who nonetheless possesses the cruel outlook of a noble.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The goal of their trip is to assess my country. He probably wouldn&rsquo;t make any misjudgement and do anything stupid due to the love he has for his daughter .</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That guy is something else, and I definitely can&rsquo;t overlook him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from that&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sorcery Dynasty Sarion has the national power to stand against the council states by itself, and it&rsquo;s a superpower rivalling the Armed Nation of Dwargon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If everything goes smoothly, we may even get to forge an alliance with them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One shouldn&rsquo;t be too greedy, that&rsquo;s how the saying goes. That&rsquo;s why I need to treat it carefully.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glancing at the surrounding guests, everyone is a prominent character.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it is only me that is holding the meeting, I may not be able to think sufficiently objectively. Considering that point, it is truly lucky for me to have the human members participating in the meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">What follows is the introduction of the members of the M</span><span class="c4">onster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Nation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are some familiar figures, but I should still do an introduction for the officers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I look at Rigurdo and the Goblin elders. Nowadays, they all look the part with luxurious clothings that can compete against any other nations&rsquo; representative.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They even look more imposed than me, it makes me feel like I&rsquo;m able to depend on them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ministers of different department greets everyone. The moderator of the forest, Dryad Treyni-san, also came to greet them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude looks rather surprised at the presence of the highest ranking species to show up here, but he still pretends to be calm and greets back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel&rsquo;s initial reaction to the scene was also interesting, they were all quite surprised by that before. Anyway, I shouldn&rsquo;t be going around and exposing them like this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At last I introduce the relevant personell from the Falmas Kingdom.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Especially Youmu&rsquo;s party, alongside Myuran and Grucius. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was planning to let these people to build up a new nation there.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, I don&rsquo;t know whether they will accept if I raise the proposals during the meeting...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This proposal may be the determining factor to the success of the meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nod to notify Shion and Diablo who were waiting for orders behind me. Thus, I was able to roughly conclude the round of self-introduction from our side.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, right, I almost forgot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shuna, what&rsquo;s the progress on Veldora&rsquo;s clothes?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes, Veldora-sama is&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna couldn&rsquo;t even finish before the delightful laughter of &#12300;GA&mdash;&mdash;HAHAHA&#12301;arrives. I was worried that his original outfit would seem unfit for such occasion so I requested Shuna to help him make a random set of clothings. It would seem I was able to catch up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the meeting room door is opened, Veldora enters the meeting room as if he&rsquo;s visiting a tourist place. I rise up to introduce Veldora and direct him to rest of the participants.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hope this one can go smoothly, I pray to myself&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Allow me to introduce him to my fellow guests. Some of you may have heard of his name, so please remain calm&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I decide to make a forecast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My subordinates are all now aware of his identity, and they all looks nervous while gulping in tension. The legendary evil dragon is right before them, and even they are afraid.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I found that the atmosphere has changed, there was a sudden silence at the scene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And next&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;This is my ally Veldora.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;m Veldora! Some people seem to call me&#12300;Storm Dragon&#12301;. Hmm, not a lot of people get to talk to me in equal term so count yourselves lucky. And you should feel honored!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as I called his name, Veldora immediately proceeded with this introduction. He&rsquo;s still arrogant as always, but it does suit him</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought I told him to stay quietly during the meeting&hellip; He probably got bored immediately and came to stir things up&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I hope you can act as the consultant of our meeting today. I&rsquo;ll be happy if you just stand aside and play nice. So could you leave now?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Gahahaha, Rimuru, you are so ruthless! Stop bullying me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Listen now, we are talking business here, so could you stop causing a scene here, okay? &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Trust me! How could I cause a scene now?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora gave me his word, so I&rsquo;ll have to comply&hellip; If that doesn&rsquo;t work I&rsquo;ll then give him his bible (manga). I must prevent him from giving me any trouble.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Up until now, the room is completely silent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone is frozen.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And&hellip;..Eh?!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4">Pong-dong</span><sup><a href="#cmnt29" id="cmnt_ref29">[ac]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rdquo;! Fuze, Elen and a couple few others just fainted on the spot while Gazel starts shouting:&#12300;Pause, pause! I need to talk to you NOW, Rimuru!&#12301; </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rigurdo and the rest decide to start kneeling and bowing their heads like last time&mdash;&mdash;The situation has gone wild beyond repair.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You could figure out why the meeting has been interrupted with your knees.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;...Or rather, the meeting hasn&rsquo;t even started yet. But it&rsquo;s no use saying that now&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The meeting room is in a mess.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The chaos was greater than I expected. It&rsquo;s armageddon in here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora sure is a mean character.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">People are are truly afraid of this&#12300;Storm Dragon&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, that is to be expected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The sudden appearance of the Catastrophe rank </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would undoubtedly cause such a commotion. To the world, he is more horrifying than Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thankfully, not everyone thinks that way.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since there will inevitably be chaos, it&rsquo;s best if I just introduce him to everyone first.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem I need to take Veldora into consideration for my future planning.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The guests from each nations looks ill with their strength all gone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though Veldora has already suppressed his aura, it may still have affected the crowds.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">My companions such as Benimaru or Shion would usually contain their aura, while the weaker </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and humans who visit this town have also gotten used to it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The new addition to the crew, Diablo, has the ability to suppress his aura even better than me. He is very talented in that aspect and should be considered as a model for everyone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The issue lies with Veldora, who is supposed to have special training session with me to learn about the techniques to control his aura.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he said in all confidence that this was nothing. I think it&rsquo;s likely due to his evolved Ultimate Skill &#12300;Investigation King Faust&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I thought everything would be fine&hellip;.. was I being too naive?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">After all, his aura was still leaking out even with the seal applied, preventing </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;below Rank B from approaching.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be safe, I tried to use &#12300;Appraisal&#12301; to determine the magicules in the room, but I found nothing out of place.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, the reason would be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru, I&rsquo;ve got something to talk to you about. Let&rsquo;s pause the meeting and so I can borrow some of your time.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel pats my shoulder and proposes, with a charming smile on his face.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was just shouting &hellip; he must be really serious. My instinct tells me to not resist him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tell everyone that the meeting would be put on hold for a moment and start to move out from my seat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one seems to object.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s no wonder, since someone has already fainted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After leaving the rest of the matters to the others, we head towards the reception room.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I followed Gazel&rsquo;s order to get Veldora away from the rest of the meeting so that shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue any longer.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Including the three Beastketeers, a lot of people wish to learn about Veldora&rsquo;s current status. That may buy us some time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ones entered in the room are Gazel and Elalude.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I requested that Shuna go make tea for the rest of the people at the meeting and told Benimaru and Shion to take care of the meeting room.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Just to be clear, his majesty the Emperor has granted me full authority on this issue. So I will speak of my stance in the name of the Sorcery Dynasty Sarion. Now that you are informed of that, please explain the situation. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude is the first to talk.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is no longer a dumb father at the moment, but a politician, the prominent nobleman of Sorcery Dynasty Sarion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is very imposing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does Sarion want to sit and watch quietly how this event unfolds?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They don&rsquo;t seem to hold any hostility, and by what he proposed, they would be observing my every move before determining their relationship with our country.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Elalude would probably still need to clean up the mess that Elen did...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At least I know they are not enemies, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem to look to them for help.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I understand. Then I&rsquo;ll swear to tell you the whole truth.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the other side has laid out their cards, I also need to be more serious about the issue.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With our agreement made, a secret meeting is thus unfolded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s hear what Gazel has to say first.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright, what do you wish to talk about?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Spare me the act. What the hell is it with the revival of the &#12302;Storm Dragon&#12303;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even man like Gazel couldn&rsquo;t conceal his surprise. His shout sounds rather agitated.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a rare sight for someone as calm as Gazel. He must have really been shocked.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could have figured out a way to play dumb, but it would be meaningless.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I decide to roughly explain the entire story.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said however, I only mentioned about meeting Veldora in the cave and assisting him in breaking the seal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as I finished the short account, Gazel begins to have headache and starts to groan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I could not have anticipated things to turn out like this. It&rsquo;s already a mess now that you&rsquo;ve become a Demon Lord, but you&rsquo;ve made an even bigger mess&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">Ehh, no need to praise me like that</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;I wanted to say that to ease the mood but chose not to. It may be my misjudgement but I think it would piss Gazel off.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So, Rimuru-dono. That lord is really&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Elalude asked, I nod towards him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora could actually properly conceal his aura like that, which is rather hard for him to believe in such short time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;I suppose it&rsquo;s true, it must have been the real deal. No man or </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would be stupid enough to try and &nbsp;fool people with the name of that evil dragon.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It actually makes a lot of sense with how he phrases it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s probably why Elen and Fuze believed the case immediately after hearing it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Not only </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">, who are aware of the importance of names, but even humans know they stand to gain no benefit by pretending to be the evil dragon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Essentially, Gazel has not doubted his identity from the start. I asked him why afterward and only got the response that &#12300;I couldn&rsquo;t see him through.&#12301;. In other words, Gazel has indirectly admitted that he can read minds. That&rsquo;s really impressive! But that really isn&rsquo;t the focus of the issue.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But, what should we do&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, I&rsquo;m already in a terrible spot trying to clean up the mess left by my daughter&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel and Elalude look at each other.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two seem to be unable to get along, but they are probably very close friends.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;The real issue would be whether to go public with this, or to conceal it.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It should be fine to do so in the western nations. As for Sorcery Dynasty Sarion, I&rsquo;ll just tell the Emperor what I&rsquo;ve heard. The problem is&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s Western Saints Church, right? You can never fool them. Among all the &#12302;True Dragons:&#12303;, the Church hates the &#12302;Storm Dragon&#12303; the most. They would definitely be on to him as soon as he had been revived.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;If we are to hide the truth, we have to act together as if we have no clue. But that likely won&rsquo;t work and render us all &#12302;Nemesis of God&#12303;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that, the two exchanged their opinions and attempted to figure a solution for my situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What about me? My job is simple. I just need to nod and say &ldquo;Hmm hmm&rdquo; to them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Are you even listening, Rimuru?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, your problem is causing us two headaches. If you don&rsquo;t take it seriously, we would really be troubled!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eh, I got scolded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I suppose I should give in and reflect, and then talk about my own views.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Since there is no way we can keep hiding about Veldora, I&rsquo;ve planned to make it public. There&rsquo;s no way around Western Saints Church but whatever, so we would eventually need find a solution.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, since you&rsquo;ve decided, I have no objection.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazal agreed without any argument.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;A alliance between Demon Lord and True Dragon is no joking matter. Honestly, the problem at hand is surprisingly difficult to deal with. But on second thought, I&rsquo;m lucky to be here. Since right now I get to participate in this meeting and was fortunate enough to gain such useful information to determine my nation&rsquo;s stance&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude smirks and expresses his view from a powerful nation&rsquo;s point of view. That is&mdash;&mdash;If both the Disaster-Rank Demon Lord and the Catastrophe-Rank True Dragon somehow coexists in the same nation, it would be foolish to try and mess with them. Gazel agrees to his view as he nods heavily.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In terms of scale, Tempest Federation is far from more powerful nations such as Dwargon and Sarion. But if it&rsquo;s only in terms of military, not only would these two nations be on the same playfield as ours, they may even be unable to surpass us. They say so because this has been acknowledged by both Gazel and Elalude in private.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;If according to your words, you will both stand on the same frontline with us if we become an enemy with the Western Saints Church, am I on the right track?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as I ask, Gazel replies dismally:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Do you have to ask this? Rimuru, you&rsquo;ve got to practice on how to maintain your composure&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he shows an annoyed look and says &#12300;Thank god this is a private meeting&hellip;.&#12301;and begins to explain to me in details.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They both have no need to antagonize my nation but at the same time, they can&rsquo;t let their own nations be in danger. Plus, they won&rsquo;t be responsible for dealing with the Western Saints Church.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel promises that he will maintain a neutral relationship while forging a diplomatic tie.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, there&rsquo;s only Elalude left&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We basically don&rsquo;t even have any diplomatic tie with Sorcery Dynasty Sarion. Even under such condition, this man still decide to greatly back us up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ll be reassured with Gazel&rsquo;s help. And speaking of which, Elalude-san&mdash;&mdash;sama, why have you been so proactive&hellip;..?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I ask, Elalude responds with an annoyed look and answers:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;There&rsquo;s no need for &ldquo;san&rdquo; or &ldquo;sama&rdquo; when you talk to me. But Rimuru-dono, please remember to refer to others with their appropriate titles and occupations in public. You are, after all, a king, so you shouldn&rsquo;t act all groveling towards foreign guests in public. If you wished to be vassalized (bring into a condition of subordination), that would be a different matter. Anyhow, allow me to answer your question&mdash;&mdash; &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He gave me a special instruction in fear of me embarrassing myself, I suppose he has a empathetic side too.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This thought made me express my appreciation, before I find Elalude is staring at me with long sighs. Then he switches up his mood and explain his reasons.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It all started with his daughter Elen.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was rumored that Elen has been held responsible due to her sharing of the Demon Lord awakening information to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, she was an accomplice in catalysing the birth of a new Demon Lord. That&rsquo;s why there is no way the nation would leave it like this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, Grand Duke Elalude was able to show his ways during this time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was able to cover up the inquisition and made it so that the emperor was the only one aware of the situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Afterward he spent the time predicting his future moves and wait for the right opportunity to strike.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magical surveillance seems to be a difficult task to execute, yet through it, Elalude was able to find out about my evolution to Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He can just pretend he knows nothing had I not become one, but there would be no way around but to intervene if the transformation was successful. When he came to visit me, he has already planned for the worst and recognized there may even be a need to dispatch invasive forces.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Based on all these reasons, I went out myself in hope of less people finding out about this.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude concludes like that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, if he was to confirms I am an evil individual, he would destroy everything as soon as possible to cover up the truth.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then, what would be your judgement?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;As I&rsquo;ve said, I don&rsquo;t plan to become your enemy, rather we should build up a friendly relationship.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see, he has accepted me. I&rsquo;m quite happy that I&rsquo;ve been judged as someone who&rsquo;s not evil.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, that would be the natural choice.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Of course. Our country practices freedom of religion, which includes more than just the Ruminas sect. Rather dying for one religion, I&rsquo;d put our national interests in the priority.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh. I thought that I couldn&rsquo;t see you eye to eye, but somehow we&rsquo;ve reached some common ground now. Elalude, my nation is also not in line with the ideology of Western Saints Church. I&rsquo;ve planned to support building ties with the Tempest Federation from the start.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon saying so, Gazel and Elalude smiles at each other.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, there are still too many questions left. Regarding the Falmas army eliminated by Rimuru-dono, even if we spread out the claim that they&rsquo;ve all died from the war, the death count is still too high. And with just that point, my daughter has suggested&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude looks rather confused while saying so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Could this be his real intent?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t the focus whether I am evil or not, he is afraid of the real casualty numbers of the war being spread in the Western Nations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no way anyone would think otherwise that a Demon Lord who murdered twenty-thousand people is not evil. The Western Saints Church definitely would have a more justified testimony, and I would be treated as a&#12300;Nemesis of God&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right, having diplomatic tie with such an evil person&mdash;&mdash;me, would indeed implicate badly on these nations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What to do then? Ehh&mdash;&mdash;I began to worry.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as I was thinking, Gazel gives off a grin and says:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ve got a solution.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, no way!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If according to what Gazel just said, the king of Falmas suddenly vanished from the world!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;All of the corpses have disappeared without trace. Wouldn&#39;t they suspect that there was no survivor?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;If that&rsquo;s the case, then you get to alter the story however you want&#12301;&mdash;Gazel smiles and respond.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;The truth matters very little to the people and the other countries. As long as the story is pleasant to the ear, it would suffice the crowds.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh&mdash;&mdash;That is a wonderful idea. Gazel, surely you would want me to co-write the script with you, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude also switches to his politician eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They probably arrange narrative in their interests to maintain their innocence. For Elalude it is probably for both national interest and for Elen&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then I should make my resolve as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, I decided to save everyone at the cost of massacring twenty-thousand people. My faith won&rsquo;t shake even if I had to bear more sin than that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It seems you&rsquo;ve decided to walk the grey area, Rimuru. That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s how it should be. It&rsquo;s not easy being a king. &nbsp;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no use regretting things now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a necessary process.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve long made up my mind. Then, how do you plan to explain to the world, Gazel?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehe, let&rsquo;s see now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel&rsquo;s gaze became a bit more gentle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Afterward we spent an hour to discuss and layout the plan carefully.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we returned to the meeting room, peace has been restored.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were finally able to get back to the peaceful atmosphere before and took care of the ones fainted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The unexpected reaction plunged the meeting in chaos, but it really couldn&rsquo;t be helped.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s just let the past stay in the past and focus on dealing with the future. Thankfully I was able to discuss a solution with Gazel and Elalude. Now that I think back carefully, that period of time was really precious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze, Elen and some others are still exhausted and collapsed in the chair.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Are you guys alright? How do you feel now?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I ask out of care. But instead they all look at me with resentment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;...........Even I&rsquo;ve not heard of it. Such an IMPORTANT THING&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Are you kidding me, you big meanie! You even kept me out of the scene&hellip;.. His name is Veldora&hellip;.-san? And he is your good friend?! Have you even mentioned that to me?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And all sorts of complaint flew straight at me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Would it really help by complaining about it to me?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s been swallowed by me into my&#12300;Stomach&#12301;&mdash;&mdash;How could I even say something like that. Plus, would anyone even believe that?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehh? I didn&rsquo;t mention? Did I now&hellip;&hellip;? Never mind, let&rsquo;s just forget about the past, pretty please (&#12291;&acute;&forall;&#65344;)? There&rsquo;s more important things to do, so let&rsquo;s have a meeting now! (&acute;&forall;`)&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I responded with a delightful smile, but it obviously didn&rsquo;t work.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;DON&rsquo;T PLAY DUMB&mdash;&mdash;!!!&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They all shouted at me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ha&hellip;.hahaha~ yes-yes&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I try to calm everyone day with a laugh.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s really because these people are too carefree. After all, they didn&rsquo;t change their attitudes at all, even after I became a Demon Lord...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t mind them being so casual to me, and I&rsquo;m even happy for that&hellip;&hellip;..But I do hope they can be more polite&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Are you even listening? Gosh, I hope you would genuinely reflect yourself!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Please stop doing this, master.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m getting heart failure from it&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they don&rsquo;t seem to follow basic courtesy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;s how Elen and her party act.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze is also the same.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, but&mdash;&mdash;I need to report this to my superior&hellip;.. Eh, but I am the head of the branch!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s how he acts, always so carefree. He has accepted the reality of the situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His reaction before of fearing Veldora seems to be fake. &nbsp;But if I hadn&rsquo;t told him to visit the restroom, he would probably have already pissed himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nice save! I pat his shoulder and got stared at &nbsp;instead.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You now, don&rsquo;t act like it&rsquo;s none of your business&hellip;...I&rsquo;m gonna have to report this to my superior first. I&rsquo;ll come back later to take the compensation for my mental damage. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My advice saved him and I&rsquo;d expected him to thank me. But somehow he argued back and scolded me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Never mind, I will be the bigger man here. I was joking with him anyway. And Fuze got back on his normal feet quick enough.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s how everyone accepted Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is an hour later by the time the meeting restart</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now the meeting can be officially commenced.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We will discuss Clayman&rsquo;s declaration of war later.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei has briefed me on this and he hasn&rsquo;t been able to find their base yet. I, on the other hand, was more concerned about whether Clayman was on the move. So I had Souei keep an eye on that as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since you can&rsquo;t exactly rush this, I&rsquo;ve decided to finish the meeting with the heads of each nation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it&rsquo;s rather troublesome, let us revisit the story once more.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were many things that took place in between, so I decided to spare everyone the details. In order to get everyone on the same page, I started to explain the situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It started from my encounter with Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I also told them my identity as a &#12300;Otherworlder&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since there&rsquo;s no need to keeping hiding it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since all of my subordinates know of my story, it would make little difference to inform Gazel and Elalude. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So what that a Demon Lord was once a &#12300;Otherworlder&#12301;? Demon Lord Leon was also a &#12300;Otherworlder&#12301;......</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I also briefly explained my battle against the Orc Lord as well the construction of the town here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is very important to share the information with others.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Given their interpretation from a different point of view, they may have a different reaction than mine.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">There were more things that happened after the construction of the town..... And I proceeded to talk about my journey to Ingracia Kingdom to fulfill </span><span class="c4">Shizu</span><span class="c4">-san</span><span class="c4">&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;will.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I did skip the details of the life at the town and Yuuki&rsquo;s request, but I also mentioned about my duel with Hinata</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was really strong.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If her opponent wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve been me, they would have been killed already.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not even Benimaru plus Souei would survive that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She may have been as strong as Hakurou, perhaps even stronger. She was also able to cast many unknown magics.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Especially &#12300;Holy Purification Barrier&#12301;, that one is extremely dangerous.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There may even be a mini-scale one for battle against single enemy. I share my memories and knowledge to everyone using &#12300;Telepathy Net&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although I&rsquo;m unsure whether we would be able to deal with it, we are better off knowing our opponents&rsquo; abilities when we encounter them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I need to try my best to let everyone realize how terrifying Hinata really is.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At least it will give them a better chance to escape.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hinata Sakaguchi, right? That woman does look very cruel and gives off the impression of a ruthless murderer. But according to our intel, the reality does not check out. For instance, she will give aid to whoever seek help from her as well as those who are willing to accept her aid. But if the people are not willing to listen to her, she would just stop helping. A very rational woman&mdash;&mdash; &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does Fuze secretly know Hinata? He&rsquo;s been defending her all the time during my explanation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t want to be hostile against Hinata either, but she simply won&rsquo;t listen to me&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It does sound like something she would do to exclude those who refuses to listen to her from the aid list.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all there are probably a lot of people seeking refuge, you can&rsquo;t blame her for letting go of those idiots.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A true rationalist.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yuuki did mention that Hinata is a realist, so Fuze&rsquo;s report was not wrong.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that said, Fuze&rsquo;s source is surprisingly accurate.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel also nods along as my thought continues to this point.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, as expected of the Brunmund branch head, you are good at manipulating the information network. The precision of the intelligences you&rsquo;ve collected can match up against those obtained by our nation&#39;s&rsquo; secret service. I can vouch for the accuracy of the intelligences. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel speaks as if he&rsquo;s playing along with Fuze.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Hinata won&rsquo;t even hear my explanation&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But that woman won&rsquo;t even give me a chance to explain.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, she has treated me as an eyesore from the start. But it seemed that she had been fed with the wrong information, but the part of not listening to reason is just&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Well, that may be because of the doctrine of Ruminas sect &ldquo;No negotiation with </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s&rdquo;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elaldu surprisingly answered my confusion. Hinata seems to be rather famous even in Sorcery Dynasty Sarion. You can tell then her reputation is widely spread, which surprises me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;No, perhaps it is the natural things from a nation&rsquo;s perspective to gather intelligence on the strongest knight in the Western Saints Church.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe she became a celebrity because of her beauty&mdash;&mdash;Such a though flew over me a couple of times, but I should probably not say it out loud.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After hearing the explanation by Fuze and the rest, I now begin to understand who Hinata really is.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is known for her cruelty in actions and words, and it&rsquo;s said to have never broken the doctrines of her religion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is the most ideal model for the Knights.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, Hinata is the guardian of law and order.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if that&rsquo;s the case, why hasn&rsquo;t she stopped the summoning ritual by all the nations?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a simple summoning ritual and would usually summon children. No matter how you look at it, these all seem to be reckless actions of individual countries.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Regarding that, there is no way we could know whether she has interfered with the summoning ritual of the nations, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze speaks up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I suppose that&rsquo;s right as well&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;The summoning magic that would bring &#12302;Otherworlder&#12303; are not knowledge to the public and are secret techniques strictly prohibited by the laws of the Western Council States. So, these nations won&rsquo;t easily admit their actions. No investigation can be led as long as they insist they&rsquo;ve not used the summoinig magic. The Western Saints Church may have access to a wide range of authorities, but they can&rsquo;t interfere with domestic policies. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">For instance, the Falmas Kingdom has been using &#12300;Otherworlder&#12301; as weapons. They would probably argue that these are just &#12300;Otherworlder&#12301; they discovered and took in by chance in order to avoid regulations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this way, there&rsquo;s indeed no definitive evidence to support any claims. The Western Saints Church wouldn&rsquo;t be able to intervene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s true, it would be unfair to blame Hinata for not being more proactive on the issue.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right, Yuuki also said something else about her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;He said &#12300;I can&rsquo;t figure her out.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps Hinata has acted in her own way in order to stop the summoning rituals.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if it is, it won&rsquo;t solve anything by worrying myself with this any longer.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Anyway, Hinata is probably gonna be hard to deal with. If she is willing to listen, I may find a chance to talk to her and resolve our misunderstanding......&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if the Western Saints Church consider us the &#12300;Nemesis of God&#12301;, our confrontation with Hinata would then be inevitable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wouldn&rsquo;t want to fight her if possible, but we&rsquo;ll see how things develop.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Kufufufufu. Should I personally set out to end her life for you? Shouldn&#39;t we get rid of the dangerous individuals to prevent further grievances?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing my own mumblings, Diablo, who&rsquo;s been waiting for order behind me, makes such proposal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This guy is surprisingly confident. He&rsquo;s a newbie, so he seems to be very eager towards every possible opportunity.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi oi, even I lost to Hinata&mdash;&mdash;no, even I fought to a draw with her! How could you be so confident in handling her?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seriously, please go through your brain before you speak, okay?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right, Diablo. Instead of sending cheap shot like you, I shall go kill that woman. So Rimuru-sama, please give me the order now! &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see. Now Diablo&rsquo;s nonsense has drawn out Shion as well!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ho ho, so it&rsquo;s Shion-san. I am grateful that you&rsquo;ve taught me the techniques of being a secretary so I&rsquo;ll put it lightly&hellip;.. It&rsquo;s a shame that you are no match for Hinata. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh? So according to what you just said, do you think you are stronger than me? Interesting, how about we find out about that right here right now&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;SILENCE!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I shout out to stop the sudden confrontation between Diablo and Shion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 553.00px; height: 828.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image21.png" style="width: 553.00px; height: 828.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">I didn&rsquo;t expect him to be so aggressive despite his calm look. He&rsquo;s so polite to me yet has no respect for his seniors. How arrogant is he for a newbie</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c0">?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Getting into conflict by provoking the opponent without themselves noticing, these type of people have such a straightforward personality like Shion&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Gahahahaha! Does that mean you wish to send me out? Very well, I shall return triumph in no time&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You don&rsquo;t have to go! Unless they decide to take the initiative in offense, we don&rsquo;t have to be the aggressor. I&rsquo;ll say this again, I don&rsquo;t want to antagonize the Western Saints Church.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Having been excited by the two, Veldora who&rsquo;s been sitting next to me suddenly decides to stand up. I give off a long sigh after stopping him immediately after.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Horrible, these three are all maladjusted children.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No no no, everyone still has space to grow. I just have to focus on educating them in the future.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that I think about it carefully, Benimaru and Souei are a lot more composed. Geld is still very trustworthy since he&rsquo;s always been sensible. Gabiru could get cocky at times, but he has learned to watch the mood, so it&rsquo;s a lot of weight off my shoulders.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga instead is still staying quietly as a listener in my shadow, and he&rsquo;s more lovable than the rest of the crew.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problem lies on these three, Shion, Diablo and Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The situation is always dangerous with these three around. I feel like I&rsquo;m getting more and more mental stress.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve got to be more cautious dealing with them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Anyhow, the topic regarding Hinata and the Western Saints Church ends here. We&rsquo;ll see how they react and act based on that. Since this may lead to a war, we will have to observe carefully every step.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I proclaim so and concluded the whole thing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, there&rsquo;s one more thing I shouldn&rsquo;t forget. There are people secretly maneuvering behind the scene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hinata knew of me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She said someone snitched to her, but luckily I can count on two hands the people who knew about me killing Shizu-san.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It won&rsquo;t be easy to find the culprit, but the ones who know me are the most suspicious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is the trio of Cabal, Elen and Kido, alongside Fuze and a couple more people from Brumund Kingdom. Then it is Yuuki. The rest would be my own people from the town.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; has filtered out the list of the suspects.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, this is about right.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But with that being said, it may have also been to the involvement of unknown parties&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t want to act on a single instinct or suspect other people without evidence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll just have to remember to keep reminding myself to be extra cautious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why would the person want me to confront Hinata?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does he wish me to take out Hinata?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To prevent me from returning home perhaps?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or perhaps to draw out Hinata?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;&mdash;&mdash;Perhaps all of the above.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No way, that&rsquo;s way too greedy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have no idea of the opponent&rsquo;s intent. But I&rsquo;ve got to endure even though it feels bad getting manipulated like this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, I&rsquo;ll stand by on this matter.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I continue to recount the events.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I told them that I discovered that our town has been attacked after I returned to the nation from the fight against Hinata.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were &#12300;Otherworlder&#12301; sent by Falmas Kingdom.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to save those who sacrificed themselves during this invasion, I decided to walk the path of Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But before I could inform them of what followed, Elen decide to break some news herself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shouldn&rsquo;t daddy know about that already? Aren&rsquo;t you here because of that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looks up to Elalude and asks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Honestly, doing this kind of thing is just cheating. Too cute.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, her poor dumb dad Elalude would probably be charmed instantly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Elen&hellip;..It&rsquo;s alright if I know about it, but you don&rsquo;t need to tell that to the rest of the country representatives&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude sighs helplessly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I understand how you feel completely.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elen does not care for the overall situation and that&rsquo;s her fault. But luckily, Elalude seemed to have predicted how things would be.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;My daughter Elen would definitely announce that she taught other people to become Demon Lords. I&rsquo;ll have to force her to come back home. But if I do so, just to have her dislike me in the end, it would be the worst strategy.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, he said a bunch of things that makes one question whether he is a genius or an idiot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As it turns out his prediction was on point, so I suppose he&rsquo;s a genius then&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have been feeling something to be amiss, so I exchange looks with Gazel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I found him nodding in agreement, so we decide to move on according to the plan we just settled.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;And that&rsquo;s how it was. I used the army of Falmas Kingdom as sacrifice and became a Demon Lord.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that, I proclaim the truth of my evolution to Demon Lord to everyone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alright, so that concluded the explanation. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now we will get to the main topic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s it. Everything I just said was true, but we will have to modify its narrative when we go public with it.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My words baffled everyone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Going public means we would be telling &nbsp;the story to the outside world&mdash;&mdash;To Majins, who consider power to be everything, such an act seems to be meaningless. No wonder why everyone seems confused.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, deception and disguise are important elements in politics.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then, what reasons would you find and how would you modify it?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru asks for the crowds. I condensed the content of our secret meeting into simple terms before explaining to everyone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I would proclaim to have become Demon Lord, but will hide the fact that I&rsquo;ve awakened.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is based on the the fact that the nations are oblivious of the full story.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because none of them sent anyone to investigate.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since all the witnesses have been killed, the only who know the truth are us the and the remaining three survivors.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Falmas King is known to be a greedy man in nature, so our defense would be justified.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s because to the people, the saying that the army lost in a war is more acceptable than the army has been wiped out by a single Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Furthermore, the large amount of corpses also unlocked the most evil seal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, the large amount of flesh blood sinked into this land and awakened the slumbering evil dragon&mdash;&mdash;It led to the revival of &#12300;Storm Dragon&#12301; Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The champion Youmu and the leader of Jura Great Forest (me), who wanted to become a Demon Lord, came to aid and convinced Veldora through the sacrifice of many </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s. In this way we were able to quench the anger of Veldora and starts to worship him as a guardian.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we are to alter the truth like this, my ascension to Demon Lord would make sense. Not only that, we are able to be justified as the victims while blaming everything else on the Falmas Kingdom. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Everyone, think about it. Humans always fear that which they don&rsquo;t understand, and they are often </span><span class="c4">to</span><span class="c0">o ignorant to admit it. When someone who can single-handedly wipe out an army of twenty thousand men emerges, even if he shows signs of peace, the humans would still not believe him.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These words come from Gazel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze and Youmu ponder out loud and expressed their agreements.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since even the ones close to me have made such reaction, I am sure that those who don&rsquo;t know me would just make the same reaction described by Gazel. If I don&rsquo;t handle it well, I may become an enemy of the western nations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;However, if we blame the disappearance of the army onto the &#12302;Storm Dragon&#12303;, people would be much likely to accept it. Since the &#12302;Storm Dragon&#12303; has already been deemed as a &#12302;Catastrophe&#12303; (&#22825;&#28797; Tensai) &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone understands once Gazel made such conclusion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Except for Veldora who seemed to have got the wrong idea, he begins to say delightfully:&#12300;Gahahaha, this man has good eyes (man of culture) to have called me a genius (&#22825;&#25165; Tensai)&#12301;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I agree to that change too. My daughter slipped off and said that she helped Rimuru-sama become a Demon Lord. Rather than suffer the hatred and fear of men, we should change it so Rimuru-sama became a Demon Lord to create an opportunity to negotiate with the &#12302;Storm Dragon&#12303; and allow the people to celebrate the emergence of a new power.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no need to balance that now, is there? Elalude finishes his words with a small smile. He stares down viciously at the surrounding crowd to see if anyone dares to oppose the proposition.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This man would do anything for his daughter Elen.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Daddy&hellip;&hellip; As expected from the sly and cunning nobleman, so cunning&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elen expresses her opinions that seem to be both praise and criticism&hellip;.. Anyhow, I feel pity for Elalude.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The room fell quiet again before we continue our explanation:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Additionally, it would benefit me in other ways as well. It is, of course, important to avoid causing panic among the humans, but it may also mislead the Demon Lords who have been </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">on guard against me that the only threat here is Veldora.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In that way, my operations would no longer be restrained.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I achieved complete victory against Falmas Kingdom, Demon Lord Clayman must have raised high alert against me. Once I&rsquo;ve released the news that states all of those things were works of Veldora, Clayman&rsquo;s guard against me would definitely lower.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel also hopes to build the image of my nation as a friendly kingdom.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I, on the other hand, wish to give a good impression to the Western Nations. In addition, I hope to lower the guard of whoever stands to antagonize us by letting them underestimate our abilities.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now our conclusion is to have others, rather than raise their guard, it&rsquo;s better to make them look down on me. It will only work in our favour.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Moreover, once we&rsquo;ve released the rumor that we&rsquo;ve established ties with Veldora, the number of counties who would dare mess with us would also decrease. Even if the Western Saints Church came out to say something about it, the other countries would unlikely to follow through their order.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is probably the biggest benefit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I don&rsquo;t accept Gazel&rsquo;s proposal now, there will eventually be a day that we make public of Veldora&rsquo;s existence. Since it&rsquo;s going to happen one way or the other, we&rsquo;d rather go public with it at the best timing possible.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We plan to deal with Clayman next, so we wouldn&rsquo;t be stupid enough to actively make an enemy of the Western Saints Church.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would also distract our own attention if we split our forces into two, so we must avoid it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have to try to lower outsiders&rsquo; guard against me as low as possible while having them raise it high against the Tempest Federation itself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the perfect draft of plan made by &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; on the basis of Gazel&rsquo;s rough sketch.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel, Elalude and me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a situation that unite us three with common interests and that which can be utilized in the future.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sasuga &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301;sama!, its strategizing skill also seems to have improved after evolving to an Ultimate Skill.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I see. That would mean you found a reasonable explanation for taking care of me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora looks all satisfied while nodding his head towards me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oi oi, this guy only seems to interprets things in terms of benefiting himself&hellip;..(Hypocrisy?)</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t exactly mean that, but never mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, he&rsquo;s assisting us in this act.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Putting Veldora aside, my subordinates also give some positive responses.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That makes a lot of sense. In that way, we may continue to communicate with others just like before.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rigurdo nods hard and speaks as if he&rsquo;s reassured. He&#39;s very worried about the economy of the country being affected in the future, and now he looks relieved. It would seem he would be focusing on development of economy for the future of the Tempest Federation. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Sasuga Rimuru-sama! That is such a unique way of thinking!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, it was King Gazel who started it. I only contributed some ideas.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I took Shion&rsquo;s praise lightly and responded. As long as they are willing to accept my proposal, I would be satisfied.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Thanks for the help, King Gazel. If we do things in that direction, we can start operating soon using Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s reinforcements.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia gives off her brave smile and gives her thanks to Gazel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio and Alvis also agree. It seems the three Beastketeers have approved the proposal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehehe, I see. That means we would be able to focus everything we&rsquo;ve got on Clayman. If I still can&rsquo;t win, even with all this,, it would be because of my incompetence.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru laughs, the future military confrontation with Clayman is supplying him with a lot of fighting spirit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What a reliable lad, hopefully he will get his stage on the battlefield soon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei and Geld also express the same sentiments of wanting to begin the attack right now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hope they could wait just a little longer. As soon as we finish the meeting, you guys can go ahead and ravage the place.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I respond in my heart while looking at my subordinates with an ardent look. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The statements for going public has been approved.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now we will plan on the future policies based on the second trade meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">First, I mention that both the King of Falmas and the Archbishop of the Western Saints Church are in our hand. We&rsquo;ll discuss about what to do about them in the future, as well as initiating our plan to support Youmu as the new king and found a new kingdom.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze begins to ponder after hearing my plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He remains silent. He is compiling his thoughts in his heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel is also not making a sound and he has his eyes closed. His companions, however, are in midst of a intense argument regarding the topic. But they are in a stalemate, with no one having reached a conclusion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude won&rsquo;t say a thing either. He&rsquo;s probably calmly calculating what&rsquo;s best for Sorcery Dynasty Sarion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I glance around to see everyone&rsquo;s reaction as I continue explaining.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">First, we will release the current king to have him to compensate for the invasion of our nation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that is only in name, our real goal is to lead Falmas Kingdom into civil war through the issue of compensation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the King attempts to reunite the nobles to rebel, we can take his life then. After all, he&rsquo;s the king of that country and I don&rsquo;t intend to let him go free.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he decides to pay the reparations obediently, we won&rsquo;t have &nbsp;to support Youmu in getting the throne . However, &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; doesn&rsquo;t think he would go for the compensation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It will still be very difficult to execute even if he wishes to compensate.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Falmas Kingdom has lost twenty thousand men&rsquo;s worth of labor. In order to restore his nation&rsquo;s power, money would be a necessity. That would require taxation from the nobles, whose greedy nobility would never give it up without a fight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would probably find a bunch of excuses to try to sneak his way through the issue of reparations. By that time, Youmu would start the protest and lead an armed revolution.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The King may also force the nobles to give in, but once he does that, there most definitely will be civil unrest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whoever survives a failed war would naturally be held responsible. By the time the surviving King decides that he won&rsquo;t carry out the his responsibilities and forces the nobles to give in&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The King would lose his reputation completely.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The issue of reparations is the key. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That way, the relationship between King and Nobles would break down.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One the King loses his influence, his factions would most definitely split as well. I&rsquo;ve heard that all of King&rsquo;s heirs are underage, which makes it easy to imagine them being manipulated by the nobles. By that time, there will be a struggle for the throne.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Youmu could try to rise up during their in-fight, and the people who are tired of the politics would definitely stand by the champion&rsquo;s side.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;At the end of the day, the demise of the Falmas Kingdom is inevitable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naturally, the Tempest Federation would support the Champion Youmu, who has been on good terms with Tempest for some time..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Youmu announces the founding of a new kingdom, we would send forth our acknowledgement and form an official diplomatic tie with them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The nobles, who would then become the power holders, would probably unite and vote against this new rising regime. But we&rsquo;ve predicted that as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ll retain the people who supported us from the start and exile the rest. If they intend to continue their disruption, unfortunately, we will have to &ldquo;assist&rdquo; them in disappearing. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We will be the force that contains the nobles&rsquo; influence in order to prevent a direct confrontation between the two parties. During this process, we will determine who is friend, or foe.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The plan is as followed&mdash;&mdash;It will take sometime before passing of policies that are trusted by the citizens, so Youmu&rsquo;s party should attempt to take down the opposition when their popularity is still high.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It will be impossible to restore the nation in such a short term.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At least two to three years are needed to buffer it out of the effects past events.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The only difference being that Youmu would get to shine earlier if the King decides to take the wrong move.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The outline of our plan is as such.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The time to support Youmu to the crown would have to depend on the situation. But he&rsquo;s most likely gonna become the next king.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I don&rsquo;t plan to torture the people of Falmas Kingdom. But since they&rsquo;ve let their rulers do whatever they&rsquo;ve desired, I don&rsquo;t exactly see them as innocent either. So I will weaken them to a certain extent before restoring their nation.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I finish the explanation for my plan with these words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone&rsquo;s been silently pondering, while King Gazel is the first to respond.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Pretty good. I don&rsquo;t object this plan. But Rimuru, it&rsquo;s another thing to have this man&mdash;&mdash;Youmu&mdash;&mdash; crowned.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel stands up as he finishes and begins to observe Youmu more closely.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What an overwhelming pressure! I could even sense that at some distance. I&rsquo;ve taken that skill head-on before, so I understand how Youmu may feel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Wuuuu!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Youmu bites his teeth hard and groans, but he continues to look back at Gazel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh, he&rsquo;s got quite the spine. But what about his nature? Does he love his people and has he prepared himself with the resolve to carry his people&rsquo;s burdens?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That line made the room quiet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmph, how the hell should I know? It&rsquo;s not as if I wanted to become king. But, since I&rsquo;ve been given a task from someone I trust, I won&rsquo;t be worthy to be called a man if I just turn it down!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ho?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I just don&rsquo;t want to come to the conclusion that I think I&rsquo;m incompetent and want to give up before even trying. Also, I&rsquo;ve got to play cool before the woman I love, so I have to give it everything I&rsquo;ve got.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Youmu replies without any hesitation. It sounds pretty moronic but it&rsquo;s surprisingly convincing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Baka...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Myuran made a noise.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That sure sounds like Youmu. Dwarf King, I would personally vouch for him. This guy may be an idiot, but he&rsquo;s not an irresponsible idiot. He will see his job to the end once he takes it. I, Grucius, swear to look over him well.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beastman Grucius responds with a wry smile. Myuran also nods to him after hearing and stands by Youmu. The three stand shoulder to shoulder while facing Gazel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Is that so? Alright then. If you run into anything bad, just come find me for help.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel then begins to nod his head dramatically and takes back his imposing attitude.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems Youmu has passed Gazel&rsquo;s trial and now they&rsquo;ve got the powerful Armed Nation of Dwargon to back them up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And after that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazal laughs and says: &#12300;Now I&rsquo;ve encountered another interesting man&#12301;; &#12300;He wants to be King for his woman, hahaha&mdash;&mdash;&#12301; Elalude laughs on his stomach. What followed was &#12300;You&rsquo;ve got some balls Grucious! You dare to say those things before us? Are you betraying Karion-sama? &#12301;as teased by Phobio to Grucius.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a rather entertaining commotion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After some laugh, Gazel begins to tell Youmu in a serious tone:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Youmu, I hope your country would produce more agricultural products. I won&rsquo;t talk too much before this turns into an interference to your national policies but hear me out. Countries like Falmas gets plenty of profit from just importing goods from Dwargon, but it has been proven to be unsustainable&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Indeed, Falmas Kingdom has very high tariffs for imported goods before retailing in order to rip off the middleman countries. These are not the ideal types of customers for Dwargon.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nowadays there are people innovating and forming new trade routes, making Falmas less advantageous in their exploits.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If things turn out like this, the country must develop new types of specialized industries in order to survive. They should avoid competing with other countries&rsquo; trade industry and instead explore the undeveloped lands near its domain in order to better coexist with other nations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve heard that there is a issue with the low supply of food in Dwargon so I understand his intent. We are in fact in the same situation, we hope to not rely on the goods from the forest, but instead import more grain from other venues.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel&rsquo;s proposal seems logical.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I want to request that as well. Importing grain should be an important subject of discussion.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t forget to push my luck as well to get a cut out of it for myself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Master, you sure are impressive&hellip;. Please leave it to me! Falmas Kingdom has been developing its agriculture, so hopefully we can meet the demands from both of you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now Gazel and I have a common interest. Youmu also promises us both that he will be assisting us in terms of agriculture by the time he becomes the king.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna begins to serve tea and dessert to everyone for a change of pace.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We switch up the mood and continue the meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Youmu is recognized and everyone has approved the plan to establishing a new nation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the biggest challenge of the meeting, now we can address the rest of the meeting more casually.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then, I shall speak while representing the Brumund Kingdom. After hearing Gazel-sama and Rimuru-san&rsquo;s proposals, I think we may be able to assist the plan. Falmas nobles Marquis M&uuml;ller and Earl Hermann have very close ties to our nation. If we were to negotiate and convince them in joining us, won&rsquo;t it bring much convenience? When Youmu-san revolts, I plan to have them to back up the revolution.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze expresses his opinion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But isn&rsquo;t he just a head of the Branch? Does he really have that much authority? Fuze gives off a wry smile, seemingly sensing my doubts and explain:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;As I&rsquo;ve said, I am the representative of Brumund Kingdom. So please consider me as an appointed personnel by the nation. Those speech I just made was not delivered as the head of the Freedom Association branch, but as a civil servant of Brumund.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After getting to know more, I found out that the Brumund Kingdom has already left a seat in the intelligences department for Fuze. Not just as a simple intelligences personnel, but an assistant to the allocation and deployment of all the intelligence units.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even if that&rsquo;s the case, the important decision you just casually made&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was going to speak up my mind, but instead Fuze explained some unexpected facts.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we were doing the secret meeting, he has already reported back directly to the King of Brumund and requested a letter of appointment with complete authority over the issue. Smaller countries are able to issue those fast, and Fuze is a trustworthy guy to many.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to himself, he knows several secrets that would ruin the Brumund Kingdom if leaked.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How about I just threaten this guy and take these intelligence&hellip;.. I&rsquo;d better not mention the thought that just popped into my head.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze seems to be able to actively utilize his circumstances and collect all sorts of information.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has extracted all possible information before we had announced any of our plans.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This man is very smart and extremely capable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for having Marquis M&uuml;ller and Earl Hermann, they seem to be backed by the King of Brumund.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marquis M&uuml;ller is a prominent noble from Falmas Kingdom, and while he seems distant from the King of Brumund, the two are very close in terms of their private friendship. In fact, he is the distant relative of the King of Brumund. The two have very good relationship. Earl Hermann is in great debt to Marquis M&uuml;ller, so it is unlikely for Earl Hermann to betray him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi oi, is it okay to break this type of news?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hahah, no problem. Even if I don&rsquo;t, Gazel-tonosama already knows as well. The secret service of Armed Nation Dwargon could easily rival the Brumund Ministry of Intelligences.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At least they would be able to keep track of intelligences from neighbouring countries&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s what Fuze said.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel didn&rsquo;t give much reaction, but he did give off a wink however. The one reacting is not Gazel, but the beauty behind him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s the head of the secret service Alieda. She&rsquo;s a powerhouse that even Souei would approve of, so she&rsquo;s indeed got a few tricks up her sleeve..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehehe, you are being too modest. Brumund Kingdom is very good in intelligence collection. Your country specializes in the trade of intelligences, and as a vital constituent, the Ministry of Intelligences must have more capable men than us.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But no matter how it seems, that doesn&rsquo;t look at what her face is trying to say.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alieda is being polite.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Haha, that&rsquo;s sharp. Our combat capabilities are far from your secret agents. But, we are no small fries if we are talking about intelligence gathering alone.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze wouldn&rsquo;t back down easily either.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Brumund is a small nation, it tries its best to collect intelligence on all the nations. These are the most favourable weapons to protect their own nation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since according to what Fuze said, the intelligence can&rsquo;t be fake. We shall pull those two guys into our camp.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Youmu, did you catch all that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yep, leave the rest to me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Youmu&rsquo;s packaging plan is thus complete.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would put on a magnificent show as a champion returning home with glory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The details of the matter couldn&rsquo;t be decided within the time of the meeting, so I&rsquo;ll leave the rest of the matter to Youmu. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moving on to the next topic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right! So we will do that with hero Youmu&rsquo;s kingdom occupation plan.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that said, everyone nods in agreement. Youmu alone is trying to hide his face in embarrassment, but I&rsquo;ll just pretend to have seen nothing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being settled, the next topic would be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we are just about to enter the next topic of discussion, Elalude who&rsquo;s been listening to our conversation begins to laugh hysterically. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Fu-FUHAHAHAHA! Interesting! You guys are so straightforward. All these people with their national interests on the line gather around here, yet they speak so openly, without any suspicion&hellip;&hellip;. It would seem that I&rsquo;ve been looking like a fool for having kept my guards up all the way through.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He laughed and says &#12300;How stupid am I?&#12301;, yet his eyes are giving off sharp glows.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s not the dumb dad Elalude, but the real-deal nobleman. The one that can&rsquo;t speak his heart in front of others, Grand Duke of Sorcery Dynasty Sarion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He suddenly changes his attitudes and caused immense stress to the crowds.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Switching his mood like flipping pages of a book and it caused everyone to quiet down.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude seems to want to say something, and everyone also eagerly awaits his words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;The wide meeting room fell in silent with only the noise of pages turning &nbsp;from Veldora reading his manga,.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eh, Oi! What are you doing, mister? I didn&rsquo;t give it to you, so where did you get it from&hellip;...?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;.Never mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought that he wouldn&rsquo;t comply in the first place.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as he agrees to remain quiet, I&rsquo;m fine with it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora helped me to relieve some of my nervousness, so now I just need to wait for Elalude&rsquo;s speech with a more relaxed mood.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude clears his throat to get everyone&rsquo;s attention back onto him and begins to speak very seriously. This man sure becomes braver the more frustrated he gets.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to ask a question. You there, Fuze right? Rimuru is a </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">, do you really trust him?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What&hellip;..do you mean?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;What&rsquo;s with this whole ordeal of </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s founding a country by themselves, shouldn&rsquo;t they at least get an official recognition? Besides, shouldn&rsquo;t you refrain from forming diplomatic ties with them? Considering your position, you should have been much more careful.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehhh, about that&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude&rsquo;s intent isn&rsquo;t to point out his flaws, but it&rsquo;s simply asking questions. In that way, Fuze became speechless, not knowing how to answer.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;In other words, my dear friend here, if I am you, I would only trade with them, meanwhile observe the reaction from the Western Saints Church. I&rsquo;ll also inform the church secretly to supply them with full authority to run an investigation on the nature of this country. I would enjoy the benefits of it and try to avoid future conflicts. Never would I stand up for them. Isn&rsquo;t that how a small country should operate diplomatically?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude&rsquo;s words are sharper than swords, and it hit home with Fuze.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from that, not only Elalude, Fuze finds that everyone else is staring at him too. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Damnit, why do you have to pick me&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He mumbled to himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Afterward&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright, I get it! If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll just be open with you!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With some resolve, Fuze scratches his head and shouts.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s become the usual arrogant Fuze. He&rsquo;s not even speaking like a politician even if the opponent is Grand Duke Elalude.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Duke Elalude, I hold the same view as you. I&rsquo;ve also tried to persuade my superiors, as well as the nobles I know, but they all rejected that&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, he begins to explain his exchange with his superiors.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s what Fuze said.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It sounds like what he told his superior is about the same as what Elalude just said, but the other side responded:&#12300;What would happen if there is a war between Brumund Kingdom and Tempest Federation?&#12301;, then rejected his opinion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This happened before I visited Brumund Kingdom, around the time we finished the battle against Charybdis.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With several Greater Majins&rsquo; aid, our country was able to defeat the Orc Lord and Charybdis. The superior believed that if they were to fight a country like this, their demise would be imminent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brumund Kingdom doesn&rsquo;t believe in the Ruminas sect, so the Western Saints Church won&rsquo;t possibly come in the aid of them. In other words, if the relationship is not handled carefully, their country may be destroyed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In conclusion, there is no use trying to resist us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alright, then what&rsquo;s next?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;We must obtain the trust of the </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c4">s. We need build up a trusting relationship and have common interests and merits. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ll do whatever we can to assist them&mdash;&mdash;this was the conclusion of my nation&rsquo;s higher-ups. Since both your country and Dwargon are powerful nations, there is no room for choice&hellip;&hellip; If my country is to make one misstep, it may be our end. We gambled our future by not begging for help from the Western Saints Church since we have faith in the </span><span class="c4">Monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;leader. That is how it is in general.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze sighs while saying so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man is really pitiful, having his inner thoughts being exposed by others. It is like saying Brumund is such a weak country that it doesn&rsquo;t have the right to choose in circumstance such as this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, that is a reality to be honest&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whether it is good or bad, right or wrong&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It doesn&rsquo;t matter. They made their grand gambit to bet on everything by choosing to trust me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;No, that&rsquo;s not right.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brumund Kingdom came to this conclusion, and there is no other way to go once they miscalculated and caused their kingdom&rsquo;s destruction.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon pondering on it, it&rsquo;s only natural that I&rsquo;m considered a threat by people since I took care of a large army just by myself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s better off allying with me than to antagonize me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perfectly reasonable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The small nation holds information and lives under the shadow of big nations That is the strategy they use.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why they believed it was the right choice and went on with all they had.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s really reckless, but it might be an effective policy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Very effective to me at least.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because I now believe that Brumund Kingdom can be trusted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude seemed to have reached the same conclusion as me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;By the way, your resolve is indeed quite firm. Just another thing, you seemed to have come here in Rimuru&rsquo;s aid. Is that also your superior&rsquo;s command?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are right. He ordered me to follow through the promise of the security pact. But, even if my nation decides to break the promise one-sidedly, I would still come anyway. That&rsquo;s because I am also a member of the Freedom Association. As part of the Association, I do not belong to any country, yet I ended up becoming the head of branch at such as place. It&rsquo;s honestly quite funny. Anyway, Brumund Kingdom has left its seat in the intelligence department for me, so I guess my luck is running out&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">Why did I take on this mess</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Fuze starts to complain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are way too honest, but that reminder is too late.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The King of Brumund seems to be more reasonable than I expected. He even followed through with the pact to stand with us against Falmas Kingdom&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought that the pact has no benefit for us, but it&rsquo;s quite an honor to have witnessed such generosity from them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrying out the promise of a pact should be common knowledge for socializing, and it should be the same for countries breaking of promise&mdash;&mdash;Just like how people who can&rsquo;t follow through with a promise cannot be trusted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This event happens to prove that Brumund Kingdom is worthy of trusting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They seemed to have believed in our side&rsquo;s victory and betted the nation&rsquo;s prospect on us. But-&mdash;&mdash;They probably didn&rsquo;t expect I would eliminate all the enemies single-handedly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What a gambler, could the superior you mentioned be referring to this person?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Indeed. It is the King, his majesty of our nation.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I asked while Fuze nodded in response, looking rather awkward.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a matter of fact, their king may seem like a yes man, but he&rsquo;s instead a tough guy in his heart, through and through. Those are the decisions you have to force yourself to make as a king of a nation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;That is rough how the story went, we did make the right choice. We didn&rsquo;t expect Rimuru-sama to have wiped out the Falmas army alone. In addition, with the revival of &#12302;Storm Dragon&#12303;, our confidence in you is no longer </span><span class="c4">relevant</span><sup><a href="#cmnt30" id="cmnt_ref30">[ad]</a></sup><span class="c0">. Because of that, the speed of approval from my superior for my letter of appointment has broken the record&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze says so looking exhausted. After all, he&rsquo;s been forced to decide on the fate of his nation, so I suppose we&rsquo;ll let him complain a bit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;I see, so that&rsquo;s how things went. I apologize, Fuze-san. But thanks to you, I got to get in the mind of the King of Brumund.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude took a step back and apologize to Fuze with his head lowered while saying so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing Elalude doing so, Gazel speaks up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are still as cunning as ever, Elalude. You don&rsquo;t have to go to that extent to probe other nations. Shouldn&#39;t you be alright knowing that I alone has faith in Rimuru?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;You are right, but Gazel, it&rsquo;s no easy decision to make when it comes to creating diplomatic ties with a country full of </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s. But now, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of respect for the King of Brumund.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh, drop the act. You guys have already made the decision before they sent you out, right? So, what&rsquo;s your conclusion, counselor Elalude?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel&rsquo;s comeback is rather imposing, but Elalude simply went through it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not due to Elalude having no concern for personal safety for his homunculus body, but because Elalude is bold enough.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I suppose. But I&rsquo;ve also come to my own conclusion. Before I would answer, could I ask another question?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time Elalude directed the question to me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Come on, Dad! Stop beating around the bush and answer!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hold on, missy! You shouldn&rsquo;t say that!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right! Duke-sama wants to play cool before his daughter. He&rsquo;s trying you know!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now the nervous atmosphere is completely thrown out of the window by the Elen trio.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;The image of the wise counselor is completely decimated&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s how Gazel describes it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feel a bit pity for Elalude, so I decide to be a little more serious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Meaning&mdash;&mdash;Releasing my&#12300;Demon Lord Haki&#12301;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Go ahead and ask, Elalude.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My subordinates started a commotion seeing this with sounds like &#12300;OHOH!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel and his companions instead are surprised at the sight and begin to groan with sounds like &#12300;Wuu!&#12301;. Moreover, Youmu&rsquo;s party, Fuze and even the three Beasteekeers begin to have cold sweat, surprised at the scene..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve suppressed its intensity to the lowest level, yet it is still surprisingly effective.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s because &#12300;Demon Lord Haki&#12301; has many other skills woven in it, such as &#12300;Menace&#12301; and &#12300;Magic Aura&#12301;. It can be used as an attack, so misusing would lead to public hazards.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said, I believe my acting skill as a king has improved.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remaining emotionless while talking is my secret technique.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hiding my emotion and talking lightly alone would intimidate my opponent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition with Shizu-san&rsquo;s beautiful appearance and my shining cells of slime, I give off a rather mysterious aura.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And along with &#12300;Demon Lord Haki&#12301;, it is almost perfect.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No need to show anymore. In fact, as soon as I show any emotions from my real self, the mysterious style would be downgraded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is probably a standard for me who was once human to uphold such a manner in doing things.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that, Elalude also got tricked by me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Ehh, impressive. So&mdash;&mdash;Demon Lord Rimuru, I shall ask you. As a Demon Lord, how do you plan to use your power?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eh, so it is about this after all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Simple question.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wish to create a new world according to my heart and allow everyone to have a meaningful life.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I could, I wish to create a prosperous world where people&rsquo;s days are filled with joyful laughter.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I truly hope so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I express my true feeling to Elalude without hesitation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s about it. But, no way things would always be so smooth-sailing, facing failure would be inevitable.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Th-that type of spectacle utopia, do you really wish to make it a reality?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, he really got spooked by it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A prominent nobleman who doesn&rsquo;t show emotion, now I&rsquo;ve got him panicked,</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, this power is gained for that purpose. There is no use talking about ideals when you don&rsquo;t have power, and won&rsquo;t you feel empty to only have power but no ideal? I&rsquo;m a rather greedy individual, but I&rsquo;m not interested in something along the line of a one-way pursuit of power.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tried to paraphrase some quotes I remembered before and used them as my message.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, shouldn&rsquo;t it be natural to think this way?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You work hard when you have a goal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s human nature, to my understanding.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ha, hahaha, HAHAHAHA! Nice, very nice, Demon Lord Rimuru! What a greedy Demon Lord! Now I finally understand why you&rsquo;ve awakened!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude begins to laugh out loud. I waited until he finished.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After he finishes laughing, Elalude kneels before me as a messenger.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Many apologies if i offended you. Demon Lord Rimuru, I, as the messenger of Sorcery Dynasty Sarion, wish to form a diplomatic tie with your nation&mdash;&mdash;the Jura-Tempest Federation. Do grant me the honor&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The scene falls silent once more.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Except for noise of book flipping.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll lose if I care. If I turn my head around now it may ruin the atmosphere.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Certain loser of a man (Veldora) is lying down on the resting bench, drinking some iced red tea that god know when he requested while reading his bible (manga). It will only ruin my pace to have him in my sight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;I wish to build a friendly relation with you as well. Do form a diplomatic tie with us.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">WOOHOO&mdash;&mdash;! There is a lot celebration at the scene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone gets up from their seat to celebrate this newfound relationship.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, there is a new nation that is willing to accept us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The third human country&mdash;&mdash;Sorcery Dynasty Sarion, has formed an official diplomatic tie with us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fall of Falmas kingdom is imminent, and new a new country shall rise under Youmu&rsquo;s leadership.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The map of this continent shall be reprinted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">But things would escalate sooner than I expected.</span></p>

		<p class="c11 c10"><span class="c4 c21">A message from Ramiris</span></p>
		<hr>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Near the end of the meeting, I was about to conclude everything.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When suddenly, there was &nbsp;a &ldquo;PONG!&rdquo; sound.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The door flung opened with someone intruding in.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Afterwards&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Heed my words! This country is going to perish!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">said the intruder.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 562.00px; height: 793.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image15.png" style="width: 562.00px; height: 793.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That someone is a tiny little fairy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her appearance may be deceiving, but she is in fact one of the Ten Great Demon Lords, &#12300;Fairy of Labyrinth&#12301; Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s one thing that she suddenly flew in here, and now she&rsquo;s spilling this nonsense.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">W-what did you just say&mdash;&mdash;! How I respond to this?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris flies straight towards me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The door is wide open and Beretta, who followed her, carefully closes it on the way in.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feel like he must have a lot on his mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, it&rsquo;s probably very tiring for him. I could almost see the way &nbsp;he gets toyed around by Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just in front of Ramiris, a person wearing a classy butler suit stops her. It&rsquo;s Diablo.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s been quietly observing the conference and awaiting orders behind me.. Looks like he won&rsquo;t allow the intruder to just do whatever they want.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How should I put it, Ramiris is immediately apprehended.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like a dragonfly being squeezed by someone&rsquo;s hand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She struggles while flapping her wings and shouts: &#12300;Wa-wait a second? What are you doing&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What an interesting fairy. It&rsquo;s very funny seeing her prestige as a Demon Lord being completely tarnished.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama, I&rsquo;ve caught the suspicious intruder. What should I do with her? She&rsquo;s been spouting nonsense about the destruction of our town, what do you wish for me to do with her? &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo returns before me and inquires with much respect.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I instead look at Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s struggling frantically trying to escape from Diablo&rsquo;s grip.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;EHHH&mdash;&mdash;! Why I can&rsquo;t escape with even all of my magic? A-are you some big shot as well? AHH, why are you doing this!? I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This fairy is still as noisy as ever.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But to be honest, Diablo does posses magicules rivaling those of Ramiris, so escaping his grip should be pretty hard for her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet she is a somehow still a Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If anyone thinks that Demon Lords are not all that strong then it would all be entirely thanks to this fairy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama, do you know this fairy?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze asks me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, the meeting got interrupted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The only thing left for us to do is to confirm the procedures (of the previous plan)&hellip;. I really wish this bugger could have just arrived a little later&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;d be equally as stupid.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Well, she&rsquo;s a fairy called Ramiris and an old friend. Despite her appearances, she&rsquo;s still actually a Demon Lord!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi! What&rsquo;s with that attitude? Don&rsquo;t judge me based on my appearances, I am known as the most terrifying and strongest among the Ten Great Demon Lords!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris still raises her chest proudly despite &nbsp;Diablo&rsquo;s restraint, and with a smug look too. She hasn&rsquo;t realized herself that there is no prestige to how she looks at all right now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh? Demon Lord&hellip;.?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hah!this thing is what now?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And words along the those lines start to be heard from the surrounding. The participants don&rsquo;t seem to be surprised about it either.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Hmm? Eheheh&mdash;&mdash;? Why? You guys should act more surprised! I am a Demon Lord you know! I am &#12302;Fairy of Labyrinth&#12303;, you know? Why is everyone&rsquo;s so calm?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No no no, even though you claim to be a demon lord, you are currently being restrained.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I guess, everyone is probably baffled right now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I considered them kind for not voicing such thoughts.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No actually&hellip;&hellip;.Since Rimuru-sama is Demon Lord as well, it&rsquo;s reasonable to expect them to know other Demon Lords&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Or perhaps I&rsquo;ve gotten over the shock of the &#12302;Storm Dragon&#12303;&rsquo;s revival, so I don&rsquo;t really get shocked many other things&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">People started talking and nodding to each other.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see, it makes more sense with the way said it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And looking back to Ramiris, she seems rather annoyed by everyone&rsquo;s reaction.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh? &#12302;Storm Dragon&#12303;.... You mean, has Veldora revived? Ha, you&rsquo;ve all been tricked! I&rsquo;ve blown away Veldora with one punch! That guy isn&rsquo;t even worth mentioning. Anyway, his reign should have ended already. So if you&rsquo;re all afraid of me, you should start worshipping me from now on!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She begins to laugh loudly as she went on a tangent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Please stop making a fool of yourself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I, taking Ramiris from Diablo, bought her over to Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Sorry, Veldora, could you spend some time with this kid? She&rsquo;s a Demon Lord after all, so maybe she can make friend with you?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh? I&rsquo;m busy solving a big mystery here.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora doesn&rsquo;t want the be troubled and planned to turn me down. But I won&rsquo;t compromise like that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Oh, about that, the criminal is XXXX.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Alright, mystery solved? I&rsquo;ll leave the rest to you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I ruthlessly revealed the criminal&rsquo;s identity and go back to my seat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, Veldora opens his eyes wide like he&rsquo;s been deeply traumatized by it as if to say &#12300;Ehhhhh? Spoiler alert??&#12301;. It&rsquo;s a bit mean of me to do that, but we are in a meeting here. Also I meant that for him to reflect on himself, so I couldn&rsquo;t let the opportunity go.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As far Ramiris goes, she has since fainted upon seeing Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, the two maladjusted children have settled down so I used the chance to restart the meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">First I need to confirm some unattended business.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Benimaru, the enemy is Clayman. We will crush him!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for that order&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru shows an unrestrained smile and gives off a devious glow from his eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only the Kijins, all of my subordinates look very delighted. Unknowingly, everyone has become warmongers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of that, everyone currently in attendance was all part of this whole mess (Falmas battle) last time&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Never mind, high morale is a good thing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then Regarding the Beastketeers and the Beastmen soldiers&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No need to continue. We will obey every order by Rimuru-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Same here&mdash;&mdash;Alvis also gives &nbsp;an devious and charming smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Same for Phobio and Suphia, so there&rsquo;s no need for more words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru, do you stand a winning chance with just these people?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We are gonna win this. That guy has really pissed me off.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, I&rsquo;ll trust you then.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel gives off an worrying smile as he muttered with his even lower voice and says: &#12300;You are supposed to be my junior yet you&rsquo;ve grown so fast&hellip;.&#12301;. I think everyone else except me must have not heard that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But this Clayman, he&rsquo;s no Demon Lord you can afford to underestimate! It&rsquo;s said that he has many Majins under his rule, and it&rsquo;s rumored that he even has connections with the Eastern Empire&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude cautiously adds, however&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t worry. War is not about quantity, but quality.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I expressed such unexpected opinion with much pride and shut him up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, I think I can hear the sound of my common sense collapsing &nbsp;in my head&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though Elalude responds in shock, he still looks rather interested in our power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even I feel my statement&rsquo;s rather illogical but I&rsquo;m definitely right.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Generally in war, the larger the size of the army &nbsp;is the more advantageous side, but this does not work in this world. The battle against the Orc Lord would be a good example, as soon as we took down the enemy generals, we all could reach a conclusion based only on the battle between the most elite of both forces. &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additionally, our number are looking quite compelling this time around as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei has gone to investigate Clayman&rsquo;s movements. And since the meeting will be going on for some time, I decide to hear his report first.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s still investigating their specific number currently. As of right now they are known to be staying in Milim&rsquo;s territory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei&rsquo;s &#12300;Clone&#12301; should be returning anytime now, so I&rsquo;ll be able to make the judgement about that soon. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s still more to discuss regarding our war tactics. But first I need to confirm our plans for Falmas Kingdom.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After releasing the King, we would be looking for Marquis M&uuml;ller and Earl Hermann to hold &nbsp;the king responsible.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ll see how they react and then eventually have Youmu start the revolution, however&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then, the issue with the war is our problem. So I hope you all can have faith in us to handle this matter. I hope everyone would be willing to lend a helping hand by the time Youmu becomes the King of the new age. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said, the guests all nod in agreement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;d rather have them handle the issues with human society, that would probably eliminate a lot of mistakes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I do hope that they will help us with it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;First off it&rsquo;s Fuze-kun, please help us contact Marquis M&uuml;ller and Earl Hermann in secret.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright, leave it to me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At my request, Fuze accepted with confidence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ll discuss more about the moderation of the plan on another day, but right now we&rsquo;ve finished outlining the plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ll pretend that Youmu has rescued the King and have Marquis M&uuml;ller take the King in under his protection, so he can acts as Youmu&rsquo;s back-up. We will release the three prisoners at a later point in time, which means&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, &nbsp;Shion, are the interrogations of the three captives going well? Have they revealed any useful information?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since she can do whatever she want to these people, I&rsquo;ve sorta forgotten about them after leaving them in Shion&rsquo;s care.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehehe, of course, Rimuru-sama!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh ho, Shion&rsquo;s quite confident.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve got an itchy dangerous feeling from her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Youmu and Myuran also accompanied the investigation, I turned my gaze towards them both but they seem like they are avoiding my eyes out of embarrassment. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still diverting their gaze, they begin to report.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;About that, Master. Investigation? Interrogation? Basically, the captives did reveal some information.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, they did&hellip;&hellip;. But that wasn&rsquo;t really an investigation, and calling it an interrogation it&rsquo;s even further from the truth&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You guys can stop here now, I really don&rsquo;t want to hear the rest of it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion must have outdone herself. But since it was me who appointed her to the job, I shouldn&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t plan on being the one complaining about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Either way, they wouldn&rsquo;t have any way of stopping the deranged Shion anyway. Since I was in the cave that whole time, it didn&rsquo;t seem like they&rsquo;d be able to contact me either.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If someone were to be held responsible, I should be the one as I failed to find the right person for the job. In other words, let&rsquo;s pretend I never found out about this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sorry, my friends from Farmas, but after all, it&rsquo;s you guys who are at fault for making the first move.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hope you will all understand that just surviving in and of itself is quite lucky.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I took the three captives alive.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Shion&rsquo;s interrogation&mdash;&mdash;I mean investigation (torture), they&rsquo;ve revealed plenty of information.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;First off, we have Ed&hellip;.Ednew? Eddie?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t it King Edmalis?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing Shion&rsquo;s struggle, Shuna whispers into Shion&rsquo;s ear and gave her the answer she was struggling to come up with. How reliable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Conversely, is shion really okay? it seems like she&rsquo;s incapable of even spelling the name of a King&hellip;.. Well, his name is pretty weird so, whatever.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It would seem that some Merchants had approached King Edmalis in the past and presented the silk product from our country. That led the King to act on his greed. Apart from that, they were afraid that our nation would become an important trading hub in the future, which is what led to the incident this time&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion continues to explain her findings which are all inline my prediction. If we have to get specific here, I&rsquo;ve would have suspected that this merchant instigated Edmalis into committing these treacheries.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Did you find out the identity of this merchant? Could he be an appointed merchant?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;About that&hellip;. I&rsquo;m very sorry.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Shion looks frustrated like a</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;leaking balloon</span><sup><a href="#cmnt31" id="cmnt_ref31">[ae]</a></sup><span class="c0">. I immediately began to comfort her. That was just a question I happen to think up, so it&rsquo;s not really that important to me honest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That doesn&rsquo;t really matter, what about the Church?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I decide to pursue something else; lets see what type of information Archbishop Rayhim has.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes! I&rsquo;ve obtained information about the mastermind. His name is&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She paused again for some time, could she have forgotten again&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;The mastermind was Nicolas Spertus.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon receiving Shion&rsquo;s eyes that seek help, Myuran announces the name in her stead.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&rsquo;s interrogation was going rather well at first, yet it got derailed near the end. She&rsquo;s not very good at memorizing jargon. Next time I should avoid having her doing these type of jobs.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thankfully Myuran is here today to save the day. Not even Youmu is as reliable as her, a truly a competent assistant.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apparently our nation is an enemy to their god, hence they plan on deploying &nbsp;their army&mdash;&mdash;It is said that this was Nicolas&rsquo; stance.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Plan on deploying their army&mdash;&mdash;That means they are still in the planning phase.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I see. So Archbishop Rayhim decided to preemptively attack the enemy of god in order to take the glory and receive commemoration from their headquarter.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze mumbles his realization, and everyone seems to agree with his conclusion as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Anyhow, there&rsquo;s still some room for diplomacy. The Western Saints Church hasn&rsquo;t made its final decision yet. If that&rsquo;s the case, we may be able to avoid the confrontation.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then, allow me to negotiate.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze decides to volunteer.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wants to drag the Council States down into this as well &nbsp;with the goal of prompting the Council States to announce the Jura-Tempest Federation as a nation and advocate that they should stand together against the Western Saints Church.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Through promotion of the Western Council States, Tempest Federation would begin to gain recognition around the world and become a new hub for trading.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The only problem is that all of the residents are </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s, but they speak the human language and treat everyone kindly. With that alone we should be able to blend in with the humans. In fact that has already been proven here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Or rather, their evolutions are very unexpected. To be frank, the goal is to have the humans &nbsp;treat our </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as demi-human like they do with Dwarves or Elves who are similar to humans.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to support Fuze&rsquo;s plan, King Gazel would also take action.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would actively increase the trading activities with our nation to raise the reputation of Tempest Federation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The doctrines of Western Saints Church strictly points out that </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s are the enemies of humans, so they would likely find it hard to accept us. However, both the Armed Nation of Dwargon and Brumund Kingdom have already started a diplomatic tie with the Tempest Federation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Even if the Western Saints Church executed on their authority, it can&rsquo;t wipe away these layered relationships. Furthermore, kingdom of </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;having a friendly relationship with human countries would most definitely draw the interest of &nbsp;other countries.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And during this time, the Sorcery Dynasty of Sarion suddenly announces a formal diplomatic tie with Tempest Federation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We will use this to continue our pursuit for success.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s rather disrespectful for me to say this, but forming ties with Tempest Federation is a double-edged sword. As such those who do should act cautiously if they don&rsquo;t want to be bitten back by it. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no doubt that this is uttered by Fuze. He is right, Brumund kingdom has the most difficult stance among them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Armed Nation of Dwargon and Sorcery Dynasty Sarion both are both &nbsp;uninfluenced by the Western Saints Church and have the power to potentially rival the Western Nations by themselves. In comparison, the Brumund Kingdom is a small kingdom that can be greatly swayed by the pressures exerted by its neighbouring countries.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;But, those are topics for another day.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehe, you are Fuze right? Don&rsquo;t worry, through Tempest Federation, your country can communicate with us,Dwargon. As long as we back up your nation&rsquo;s stance, the Council States won&rsquo;t underestimate you. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel is right.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Armed Nation of Dawrgon and Sorcery Dynasty Sarion both have very different cultural background and technologies. With the addition of the exchange with Tempest Federation, this town would see surprisingly great speed of development.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A new era of culture would soon be upon us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, the Magic-fueled Science Sarion is so proud of and Spirit Industrialization developed by Dwargon are two different branch technology. With the two combine&mdash;&mdash;It will no doubt invoke to a fantasy like Industrial revolution.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Brumund Kingdom gets to taste the cherry on top.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The profits to be gained, compared to the loss, definitely won&rsquo;t be small.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for the changes of Falmas Kingdom to come at Youmu&rsquo;s hands, they can become an agricultural nation. We can satisfy &nbsp;our region&rsquo;s hunger and inspire new food culture.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to prevent competition with the specialties among each other, we must share our opportunities for profits properly&mdash;&mdash;In regards to that I&rsquo;ve been planning something behind the scene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Ultimate Skill &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; has the processing power to outcompute a quantum computer easily. It is more economic and precise than the supercomputer &#12300;World Simulator&#12301;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c0">, so it&rsquo;s a piece of cake to compute complex calculations with precision.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feel like an member of the Illuminati, manipulating the events &nbsp;of the world&hellip; But it&rsquo;s okay since I am a Demon Lord after all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I also understand where Fuze&rsquo;s worry is coming from.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brumund Kingdom is small and is afraid of being exploited by bigger countries.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To break off from the States&rsquo; Council which recognizes the rights of smaller counties is a difficult decision. And this is the source of Fuze&rsquo;s worries</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No wonder why he would feel anxious with the plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, there may even be short-term benefits in continuing their interactions with the Council. If all of the intelligence forces from Brumund are utilized, it may not even be a problem to have catalyzed a total war between Western Saints Church and us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I had caused them to contact the Church from the moment we met, we might have already suffered a crusade.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the people of Brumund didn&rsquo;t choose that path.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They instead chose to believe me and fight alongside with us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This so called result was the product of their free will after all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brumund Kingdom has chosen to align with us, then it wouldn&rsquo;t be wrong of me to give them some advice back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;After all, coexistence is my dream.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Fuze, could you help me convey a message to the King of Brumund. I have something that requires his assistance.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Assistance? Is it something troublesome again?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rude much! It would take too long to explain it now, in addition it&rsquo;s something hard to comprehend, so I plan on explaining it directly to him myself next time I visit.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Aren&rsquo;t you the rude one Rimuru-sama! Are you suggesting that my head isn&rsquo;t good enough?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, I didn&rsquo;t mean that. Since, could you have happened to be an expert of economics? &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehhhhh&hellip;.. Alright. I&rsquo;ll deliver the message to the King and arrange for your meeting.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, I responded with nodding, and ending the conversation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The mission of Brumund Kingdom is to grasp the quantity of transactions in trades. To investigate the exports and imports of each country and deliver the right goods to the right place. In short, they will become the first trading company to be established in this world.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If this operation is successful, the small country would no longer be small. It would gather immense influence and give birth to the concept of international industries.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the Brumund Kingdom and where they are geographically positioned, I hope they would one day become a trading hub.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the details of these will have to wait before our attack plan is settled.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We need to take down Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Youmu also needs to build up a new kingdom.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for Fuze and Brumund Kingdom, they will utilize their expertise in intelligence gatherings and manipulation to stall the advances of Western Council and the Western Saints Church, at least till our side has achieved our victory in the upcoming war.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To us, the Western Saints Church is a huge threat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though they may not take any immediate action, stalling them is still necessary.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The Western Saints Church will not recognize a kingdom of </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s, and neither will the Holy Empire Ruberios.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I want to try my best in reducing and delaying possible conflicts, and prove to the outside world that we are able to help everyone and live peacefully with humans.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it ever comes to a war, I hope I would be able to settle things peacefully, but&hellip;&hellip; judging from Hinata&rsquo;s reaction, it won&rsquo;t be easy...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">None of the problems have a simple solution.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything will depend on our actions from here on out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the next thing on our list, let&rsquo;s have the three captives&mdash;&mdash;Hmm?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have King Edmalis, Archbishop Rayhim, and who&rsquo;s the other guy?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh yeah! It&rsquo;s the one I didn&rsquo;t beat to death.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is it really okay to let these kind of people walk free again?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shion, aren&rsquo;t there three captives in total? The one who survived my attack, has he been a nuisance to you?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh? Ah, yes. You mean the man who&rsquo;s still in shock, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still in shock? I see he&rsquo;s barely surviving as well. So he wasn&rsquo;t a big deal then.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, you are talking about that man who survived. It sounds like Knight Commander Fayken, is he?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel seems to have heard of this guy, does that mean he&rsquo;s considered a strong general? Hmm&mdash;&mdash;If that&rsquo;s the case, wouldn&#39;t it be dangerous to release him like this?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turn to Diablo and ask:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What do you think of him? Shouldn&rsquo;t he be quite strong? Is it okay to let him go?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Diablo responds with a smile still on his face no less.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, Rimuru-sama. He&rsquo;s just a nobody (to me). However, in terms of human standards, he seems to be quite talented in conjuring magic.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A mage? If that&rsquo;s the case, it can&rsquo;t be the Knight Commander named Fayken.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shion, do you know his name?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion responds naturally as I ask.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes! His name is Ramen!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, so he&rsquo;s called Ramen.Eh, speaking of that, I haven&rsquo;t eaten ramen for years.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The instant ramen I ate during night shifts tasted really good.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The nostalgia&mdash; I should try recreating it next time. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I begin to recall things before my reincarnation&hellip;....</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ramen? Is there someone called that name in Falmas?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I can&rsquo;t recall one. And a magician? Magic? Speaking of magic, there&rsquo;s a Majin called Larzen from Falmas&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;The </span><span class="c4">Hero</span><sup><a href="#cmnt32" id="cmnt_ref32">[af]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Larzen? That man is quite the character. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze, Elalude and Gazel claims so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only these though,</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Hero</span><sup><a href="#cmnt33" id="cmnt_ref33">[ag]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Larzen.. I&rsquo;ve heard of him. His name proceeds even to the Beast Kingdom. That man is the guardian of the great Falmas Kingdom, so called &#12302;The Wise Mage&#12303;. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve heard about it too. He is a human, but his magical ability could easily surpass any mages. I&rsquo;ve wanted to have a fight with him.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But, we will probably have the upper hand in close quarter combat. Nonetheless, this human cannot be underestimated.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a surprise that even the Beastketeers knew him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t imagine someone like that would stay in Falmas Kingdom&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man called Ramen isn&rsquo;t important, but instead we should be cautious against this Larzen guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shion, are you sure that guy is called Ramen?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes, lemme think, probably yeah&hellip;. But, he&rsquo;s super young! He&rsquo;s one of the people who attacked the town, and definitely not the magician everyone is talking about!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She did not sound sure about the first part, but seems very certain about the second half.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eh, but, isn&rsquo;t this a bit strange?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo also mentioned that he&rsquo;s a mage&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It got me kind of worried, so I decide to inquire from not only Diablo and Shion, but everyone else.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The one in captivity is a young man who once attacked this town. There is no doubt he is an &#12300;Otherworld Traveller&#12301;. It would seem it also matches up to everyone&rsquo;s testimony.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Diablo, could it be that you are lying to get praises from Rimuru-sama?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion starts to provoke him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What a surprising proposition. He&rsquo;s just some cheap shot that got beaten by me. Only an idiot would hold him in such high regard. I was simply completing my task in order to have Rimuru-sama grant me the rights to serve him.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh yeah, Diablo did once say he wanted to serve me. But he didn&rsquo;t mention that his opponent was that strong, and he doesn&rsquo;t seem that bothered about it at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This would mean&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Speaking of this, about that &#12302;Otherworld Traveller&#12303;. When Geld and I cornered him to a desperate spot, there was a quite powerful mage who intervened. That man is indeed called Larzen. It would seem that he has come prepared with Nuclear Strike magic ready to be unleashed at any time. I thought it would have caused much damage to our side, so I decided to let him go&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hakurou recalls and reports to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So it&rsquo;s not Ramen, but Larzen?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Report. By casting a secret technique under the Spirit Magic series, one can replace his body. &#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, so that is what it is.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;If that&rsquo;s the case, could it be that this mage called Larzen has transferred his consciousness into the young man?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehh!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With me pointing out the possibility, Shion begins to panic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My guess is probably right that she was uncertain about the captives&rsquo; names.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Kufufufufu. Whatever his name is, we should be able to find out soon.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo cuts off shion with that line, causing tears to accumulate around her eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the end, that man is indeed Larzen.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no Ramen guy, get it? So you can stop blaming Shion now. It can&rsquo;t be helped after all, Shion is Shion. Basically, it would be a mistake to assign any task involving brain work to Shion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;But, to be able to beat the crap out of that Larzen!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;I really can&rsquo;t believe it, he&rsquo;s been the </span><span class="c4">Hero</span><sup><a href="#cmnt34" id="cmnt_ref34">[ah]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;that Falmas relied on for hundreds of years....&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;His power as a mage could even rival with mine, and may even surpass mine, such rare prodigy has been&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone is astonished at this revelation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The one who they are astonished by is Diablo.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thinking back now, Diablo is indeed a mysterious individual.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why does he want to serve me? Although since he doesn&rsquo;t mind providing free service, I don&rsquo;t have any reason to refuse.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he talks so lightly of the man that everyone thinks we should be extra cautious towards. It would seem he is really strong indeed, and that&rsquo;s before I named him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now he&rsquo;s even showing off his strength in front of Shion. But it&rsquo;s due to her own actions, that&rsquo;s why she can only bite her teeth regretfully.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, all is well. There shouldn&rsquo;t be any problems moving forward as long as Shion hasn&rsquo;t considered Diablo to be her arch nemesis. old butler vs Elite butler, this type of relationship is probably the breeding ground for jealousy.. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right, I&rsquo;ve decided!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Youmu, the mission that initially involved you bringing the three captives, take Diablo with you too.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said, it&rsquo;s Diablo this time who&rsquo;s looking at me in panic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although I can see Shion&rsquo;s smirk, I didn&rsquo;t give that order for her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is my judgement after much thought..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are waging war against Clayman soon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora will be taking the duty of protecting this town, and I happen to be worried about who to put in place to assist Youmu&rsquo;s party.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This individual must have clear head and the abilities to play to adapt to various situation. In addition to that, this person needs to be able to travel fast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei is the most suitable candidate, but I wish to see how he performs on the battlefield.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru is the leading general of the army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion is a no go.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hakurou can&rsquo;t use &#12300;Shadow Step&#12301; and &#12300;Dimension Transportation&#12301;, making transportation more time-consuming.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for Geld and Gabiru, their appearances are too eye-catching in human society. And considering their personalities, they definitely aren&rsquo;t the most qualified strategists here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In lieu of all this, Diablo is the only person able to fulfill all these conditions. He once said he is willing to take down Falmas Kingdom himself, so he shouldn&rsquo;t be objecting to it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I also want someone to watch over that troubling guy Larzen, surely Diablo should be able to handle it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ll be counting on you, Diablo!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes, I understand, Rimuru-sama!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Having been requested by me, Diablo gives out a joy-filled smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Something&rsquo;s amiss about this, but since he&rsquo;s agreed to it, it&rsquo;s no problem. I can picture Diablo right now as the strongest here after Veldora and me. He should be able to act accordingly no matter what happens.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It might take a few years, so you&rsquo;ve got to keep your composure. Whatever happens, you can contact me whenever you wish using &#12300;Telepathy Net&#12301;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No problem. It won&rsquo;t take that long, I will quickly resolve the issue.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such a confident response, we&rsquo;re talking about eliminating an entire country here. But it is precisely because of that, I am able to reasuridly task him with this mission. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that we have one less problem to deal with. We can now fully focus on waging total war against Demon Lord Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, the our time of making confirmations for the arrangements has come to an end. So the meeting with the heads of nations is concluded for now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the very end I want to confirm whether there is any other issue anyone wishes to address. And it turns out someone did raise their hand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s Elalude. He looks at me as if &nbsp;wanting to say something.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What&rsquo;s wrong?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing this, Elalude begins to talk without hesitation</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;My nation Sorcery Dynasty Sarion is also quite a ways off from here&mdash;&mdash;That is the Tempest Federation. There are very annoying forests and mountains in between our nations. If there was a direct path between our nations, it would greatly reduce the time spent in travelling. If we are able to open a road in between us, it would be highly convenient for our exchanges&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He winks at me as he finishes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm huh&mdash;&mdash;I know where he is getting at.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since we&rsquo;ve established ties with the Sorcery Dynasty Sarion, it would be much more convenient to have a direct road constructed to each other. Of course I would undertake such construction.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The benefit is being able to directly transport goods &nbsp;instead of of taking the previously longer detour, that is why I&rsquo;ve considered it as part of my plan from the start.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the construction would require a mass-reform of the land, for instance, deforestation, digging of tunnels as well as paving operations on the roads. It will expend a massive national budget in order to execute all of the above operations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Sorcery Dynasty Sarion may be strong, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it can easily provide a budget at the scale of this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude, by his careful consideration from the standpoint of a Duke, he would likely push all the work on to us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Elalude, you are being real scummy here. How could Rimuru agree so easily to such a substantial request.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel decides to defend me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But hold on a second, didn&rsquo;t we take up the responsibility for the entire project of constructing the direct roads to Dwargon?!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Surely you jest, Gazel! It&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable for Rimuru-dono to reject me, you of all people should know that you don&rsquo;t have a say in this!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, so Elalude knows about that as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Could we have avoided this had we rejected Gazel&rsquo;s request?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be honest, it&rsquo;s alright if we are to take full responsibility. Constructing roads are just a small investment compared to having more human recognition.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But with that being said, if I just agree to it like this, it may entice other countries to take advantage of us in our future diplomatic relationships. Just like how I was taken advantage of during my trip by Brumund Kingdom. Humans are truly cunning creatures.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I&rsquo;ve got to knock him down from his high horse right now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I understand what Duke Elalude meant. I believe is fine for us to handle the construction of the road, however&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;However?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude gulps as he looks towards me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&rsquo;t be so nervous, I don&rsquo;t plan on doing anything outrageous.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;However, we would also be the ones responsible for the security and hotel business on the road. And of course, the cost of construction would eventually be transferred to the road users via a carefully considered amount of toll.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These rebuttal are what came out of my mouth.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In simpler terms, we will create a charging mechanism like those on highway. Travelers will be charged a certain amount of fee every some distance away at a alarm outpost. This will turn into long-term profits. Despite how it seems to be unprofitable in the short terms, it would gradually transition to profitability as time goes on. This is the so called conscienceless national income.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additionally, we get to do another country a favour by taking the job of constructing a road.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;I understand now, that&rsquo;s a great idea. And it sounds very reasonable. But, regarding the toll you mentioned. I hope we get to renegotiate it every couple of years.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh? Elalude is not so simple-minded after all. I see that he has guessed my thought immediately.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No problem, we will have to build this type of things on the basis of consensus. There is no point in pricing the toll too high, hence I will accept his suggestion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Okay, we should do just that!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So casual!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze shouts out in surprise, but I don&rsquo;t really mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diplomacy is all about judgement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Geld! You&rsquo;ve got more work to schedule!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Understood! Much Obliged. We&rsquo;ve learnt much about labor coordination from all the projects we undertook so far, and some even gained the skill of supply and manipulate earth from transporting resources. Whatever work Rimuru-sama give us will be the best field for military training! &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">EH! Ah, so&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s how they feel about their work.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I thought Geld is a sensible man, but as it turns out he&rsquo;s quite the aggressive war-monger too. What a surprise, it caused me to be speechless for the moment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah-Okay then. If that&rsquo;s the case, we&rsquo;ve got to end the battle quickly and start working early.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed. Do come around to check on the results of our daily training!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld seems very motivated.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would definitely be very active during the battle against Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No other person seems to have much else to say.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all the twists and turns, our meeting has finally concluded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">All the nations involved in the meeting all have their own agendas, in an effort to create a world where Human and </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;coexist, they exchange their views.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">This meeting that took place without prior scheduling&mdash;&mdash;The future generations call it the Meeting of Man and M</span><span class="c4">onster</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;It&rsquo;s considered a significance historical turning point. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;A big step forward again towards our ideal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that the meeting with the nation leaders has concluded for some time now, we can finally conduct the military meeting regarding the war against Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve had everyone to be ready and hope they would all listen to Souei&rsquo;s report together with me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feel as though I&rsquo;ve forgotten about something&hellip;.. With the thought flowing through my head, I realize.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right, Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What was that annoying fairy actually trying to say?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Come to think of it, is she still fainted?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am starting to worry about her so I decide to see to Veldora and check on her condition&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t believe this is happening.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris is over there intently focused on reading manga.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And here I thought I would make her cry if I don&rsquo;t go spend some time with her. That concern is clearly unnecessary.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Oi, you there, what in the world are you doing?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had to ask.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hush! I&rsquo;m just getting to the good part, talk to you later.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris won&rsquo;t even raise her head, and instead making this comment to try and sneak out of the conversation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What is she doing here anyway?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Currently she&rsquo;s got all her attention on manga, but didn&rsquo;t she have something important to say?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps it went down like this&mdash;&mdash;Ramiris who awakened from her coma and was about to cause a scene but discovered the scattered manga on the bench. Then she was drawn to the manga so much that she immersed herself in its world, not even realizing that the meeting has ended.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She seems awfully similar to Veldora. It&rsquo;s almost as if her fainting was an act. The two now are so close that both are requesting services from Beretta.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m speechless.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My look turns to Beretta.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I should congratulate you for your evolution to Demon Lord. I&rsquo;ve wanted to express my gratitude since I&rsquo;ve also evolved thanks to your evolution. With your blessing, I have evolved from &#12302;Arc Doll&#12303; to &#12302;Chaos Doll&#12303;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he finishes, he bows to me respectfully.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta seems to have evolved into a Chaos Doll, which possess the opposing elements of Holy and Demonic at the same time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">It may have resulted because of his unique skill &#12300;Amanojaku&#12301;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c4">(Heavenly Evil Spirit)</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This skill would automatically obtain the opposite attributes for whatever attributes Beretta gains. In other words, take Beretta for instance, his birthright as Demon race can be reversed to give him powers of Angel race as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The new &#12300;Spirit Core&#12301; generated in Beretta&rsquo;s body combined with the old &#12300;Demonic Core&#12301; ended up giving birth to &#12300;Chaos Core&#12301;. It is said that when he utilizes the power of this Chaos Core, Beretta could even mitigate his past weakness, the Holy elements.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s just way too crafty&mdash;&mdash;I believe I am not the only one with that thought.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With his body built from tight magisteel, most physical and magical attack won&rsquo;t be able to harm him. And on top of that, even his weakness got patched up, this is definitely one of the strongest evolutions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Him learning the unique skill &#12300;Amanojaku&#12301; also seems to be related to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think it&rsquo;s probably my anxiety back then that granted him such strong emotion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I was trapped by the &#12300;Holy Purification Barrier&#12301;, my magicule was sealed and I felt as though I was nothing. Perhaps that sensation led him to obtain such power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Arc Doll&#12301; operates on magicules and he knew if he is in the same place, he would be rendered unable to move. That&rsquo;s why, his evolution is a solution to that concern.</span></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whether it is the unique skill &#12300;Amanojaku&#12301; or his &#12300;Chaos Core&#12301;, these are all very intriguing research materials for me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Report. Unique skill &#12300;Amanojaku&#12301; has been compiled by ultimate skill &#12300;Covenant King Uriel&#12301;. This skill can now be replicated through the all-attribute-viable skill&#12300;Law Manipulation&#12301;. In addition, the production of &#12300;Chaos Core&#12301; would require the presence of the following ingredient under the conditions of&mdash;&mdash;&#12299;</span></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nani!</span></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; begins to report as if it&rsquo;s nothing again, what a genius!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh yeah, I have &#12300;Food Chain&#12301;!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The skill &#12300;Food Chain&#12301; is part of my ultimate skill &#12300;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&#12301; that allows me to acquire the prototype of skills from my subordinates.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta seems to be part of that as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Afterward, I had a little chat with Beretta.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seems rather happy, not much complaints so far.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he was conducting all sorts of experiments in the labyrinth. He only discovered my evolution after he himself evolved during the incident.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Anyway, it&rsquo;s reassuring to hear that you&rsquo;ve been doing well. Let&rsquo;s talk more when the business at hand is resolved. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Haha, thank you for your care. I will be looking forward to that.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, it&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;ve got the abilities to accommodate Ramiris&rsquo; whimsy now. Anyway, just follow her orders unless it&rsquo;s something unreasonable and things should turn out fine.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Leave it to me. I will definitely meet your expectations!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, good luck. By the way, why did you guys come here?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I ask Beretta and look towards Ramiris who&rsquo;s still wholeheartedly devoted to her manga.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;A-about that&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta seems to recall the intent of their journey and begins approaching Ramiris and persuade her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ramiris-sama, now it&rsquo;s not the time for this. You should tell Rimuru-sama about that thing fast&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You&rsquo;re super annoying! I&rsquo;m busy right now!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Please state the intention of your visit.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I-HAVE-TOLD-YOU! This is my destined encounter! In this great reading material called manga, which boy would the heroen choose&mdash;&mdash; &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris speaks as if she&rsquo;s justified.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta sure has it hard.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta seems too pitiful like this, but it can&rsquo;t be helped.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have a vague idea of the type of manga she is reading. With a sigh, I went over to threaten her. If I don&rsquo;t, I may have to wait until she finishes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;By the way, that manga is a forty-volumes long mega piece. Even if everyone says I am as kind and tolerant as a Buddha, there are things that even I can&rsquo;t bear.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi, Ramiris. If you don&rsquo;t want me to spoil who the heroen will fall in love with, state your business here immediately!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My prediction was right that my intimidation would work.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;YES!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She jumps up with both hands while trying to recall the intention of her visit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing how casual she looks, surely she has some mundae news to report on. It must have only been her own exaggerations before.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other guests from different nations who were chatting and packing up in preparation to return home also seem to recall that there is this Ramiris here. They all paused their actions and probably also want to hear what she has to say before leaving.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris seems rather pleased with the situation and raises her flat chest. She crosses her arms and begins nodding as if she has something on her mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I will say this one more time! This country is going to perish!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That line came right out of her mouth.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;W-what did you say&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I responded with flat tone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Ramiris begins to follow up insatiably, as if she has granted me a great favour.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh huh! Eh, I didn&rsquo;t want to see that happening either, that&rsquo;s why I came to inform you, so be thankful!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would probably take too long for me to deal with her seriously, so I&rsquo;d just have to casually respond.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So, why will our country perish?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;About that, before I could tell you the reason&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris paused and switches to a more serious look. First she glances around at all the important individuals from each country, and with a slight consideration she continues with nods.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright, this may still be relevant to the humans. Very well, you guys should hear it too. Demon Lord Clayman has proposed to initiate the Walpurgis Banquet!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Walpurgis Banquet?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes, Walpurgis Banquet. The special meeting where Demon Lords across the world sit under one roof.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What in the world, when she said &ldquo;initiated&rdquo;, I thought it is some sort of grand magic. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be worrying if he took the initiative in attacking when we are in the midst of planning an attack ourselves?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After further inquiry with Ramiris, I discover that Walpurgis Banquet seems to mean having all the Demon Lord gathered at one place.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to initiate Walpurgis Banquet, it requires approval from at least three Demon Lords. Once initiated, all Demon Lords have a high level of obligation to attend. It is one of the few agreements among the Demon Lords to force Demon Lords, who are acting as they desire, into order.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is said also that some more casual individuals who won&rsquo;t attend the meeting themselves, but instead they would appoint their subordinates to attend in their stead.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;If that&rsquo;s the case, there are records which states that there will be a great war after each meeting among Demon Lords. That&rsquo;s why the Western Saints Church decided to name that day the Walpurgis Banquet.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to Elalude, it is a document from about a thousand years ago that recorded the event. It is said that the Great War has led to great catastrophe with heavy casualties.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Due to the Western Saints Church naming the event &nbsp;Walpurgis Banquet, the people all think it means &#12300;The Demon Lords&rsquo; feast that will destroy world and plunge it into the chaos.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The so called great war is probably referring to the great world war that has happened countless times.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or is it really true that when the Demon Lords gather, there will be a great war? Or could it be that they were preparing to provide support to someone for a great war?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Does that mean that the great war was caused by the Demon Lords?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No way! I don&rsquo;t have that kind of free time, isn&rsquo;t waging war super complicated? No one wants to do that!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris instantly dismissed my doubts.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how you look at her, she looks like she&rsquo;s got all the spare time in the world&hellip;&hellip; No, nevermind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that I think about it, she is one of the Demon Lord too. And she seems to have lived for quite long, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be strange if she had attended the meeting thousand years ago.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, Elalude nods at Ramiris and proceed to say:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Demon Lord Ramiris&rsquo; words are probably true. The great war has the official name &#12302;Tenma Great War&#12303; (Great War between Angels and Demons), where all major forces are competing for control. With that being said&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to Elalude, the great war takes place every five hundred years.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason for that, it is said that the angelic force from heaven would attack the earth.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The army from heaven&mdash;&mdash;meaning the angel race.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The angels are like the </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;s natural nemesis , but they attack indiscriminately.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or rather, for some reason, they always pick the most advanced cities to attack first. The reason is unknown, but, that is just a rumour.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s the reason why we&rsquo;ve stayed underground and refuse to come out.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Says Gazel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The development of Dwargon is going well and surely to be eye-catching, so this decision is most definitely the right one.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s the same case for the Sorcery Dynasty Sarion which has its cities built inside the giant caverns of the God Tree. I recall Gazel mentioning the &#12300;City embraced by the God Tree&#12301; to Elalude. It must have been a reference to this fact.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two powerful nations both took the necessary precautions in defending their nations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, the Western Nations&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The Council&mdash;&mdash;It was made up of Western Nations in order to defend against the </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s. And the other reason is to survive the Great War.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The countries in the council pledge to helps each other out, while Dawrgon and Sarion are both able to hold their own ground. The enemy here is the angel race alone&mdash;&mdash;But it&rsquo;s not the entire story.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">When the angel race attacks , the </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c4">s also become more active. The </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s in question are ones that possess intelligence, aka the Majins.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some Demon Lords would take advantage of the great war to invade human nations. It was the case a thousand years ago and tales depict it to be a brutal scene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, the humans themselves aren&rsquo;t enemies to be underestimated either.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The current hypothetical enemy, Easter Empire&mdash;&mdash;Sovereign Alliance of the Nasca Namrium Ulmeria Empire, could be onto something. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The hegemonism</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the Eastern Empire doesn&#39;t care for time or location. They could very well march against the Western Nations as soon as they discover their weakness.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">In conclusion, this is the great war mixed with Angels, </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s and Humans&mdash;&mdash;so called &#12300;Tenma Great War&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, it would be a false accusation to blame the Demon Lords as the cause of the Great War.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I myself also wouldn&rsquo;t want to start a war either.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of that, if the angels would attack the more advanced nations first...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was hoping to develop this town and outrank other cities in prosperity. But, this can wait I suppose.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be wise to at least hold off on that for now and we prioritize the development and fortification of essential infrastructure for defense.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that would come later, I need to take note of that mentally.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">First we have to deal with the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;If that&rsquo;s the case, what is the point of Walpurgis Banquet? Why are all the Demon Lords gathering?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it&rsquo;s not related to the great war, there must be other goals&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, could that be it? Milim did said that the Demon Lords would judge individuals who self proclaim to be Demon Lord. Could they be holding a meeting to decide on sending someone to deal with me?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;About that&mdash;&mdash;First of, you seem to have misunderstood, so allow me to explain.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right after which, Ramiris speaks of something that&rsquo;s the furthest from what I could imagination.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We actually hold the Banquet quite oftenly. It only needs three or more Demon Lords&rsquo; approval to initiate, so it&rsquo;s not hard to initiate. In it&rsquo;s past, it&rsquo;s the equivalent to me, Guy and Milim, us three having a little tea party&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris tells us and continues:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;In other words the Walpurgis Banquet is just the Demon Lords gathering together to update each other on each others&rsquo; status while discussing trending topics. It&rsquo;s just that the humans certainly wouldn&rsquo;t know about that, but it&rsquo;s really nothing dramatic. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She breaks the huge news.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I always thought that this fairy is too simple minded and probably has a horrifyingly large gap in perception compared to the rest of the Demon Lords. So I can&rsquo;t exactly take her words seriously, or it may really lead to something tragic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve got to scold her for it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Idiot! If it&rsquo;s just a small tea party, why would you say our nation is doomed?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s really done it this time getting someone as gentle as me angry.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This annoying brat sure is stupid.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, no! The problem isn&rsquo;t the Banquet itself, it&rsquo;s the subject-matter!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris corrects herself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The subject-matter? So the Demon Lords have indeed gathered to exterminate me&hellip;.?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to what Ramiris just said, there are two other people supporting Clayman&rsquo;s initiation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are Demon Lord Frey and Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Due to the three Demon Lords&rsquo; motion, including that of Clayman, the proposal is approved.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from that, the subject of discussion is&mdash;&mdash;&#12300;The rise of the new force in the Great Jura Forest and the Leader of Forest Alliance dares to self-proclaim as a Demon Lord.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It must be talking about me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I mean did you&hellip;.. Did you proclaim yourself a Demon Lord?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t regret it, nor do I intend to reflect on it!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I replied honestly since Ramris asked.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm&mdash;&mdash;I am not surprised it&rsquo;s you. You should be fine as long as you stay tenacious, even though there may be a lot of trouble on the way.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Says Ramiris sounding quite relaxed and delighted, as if it&rsquo;s none of her business. No, it&rsquo;s indeed none of her business.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve already prepared myself mentally, so anything goes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So, are they going to punish me?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve indeed planned on punishing me&mdash;&mdash;Or so I thought, but things seem different from what I will hear from Ramiris soon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That is the case in name, but whether you get punished is not the point, it&rsquo;s simply a unwritten rule in our industry. Clayman initiated the Banquet because he claimed Demon Lord Karion has betrayed everyone. Not only that, Clayman is also going to press the issue that his subordinate Myuran was murdered.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is being Demon Lord considered a job? What industry are you talking about? I teased so but got ignored.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that Clayman is claiming someone has murdered Myuran and would probably say the criminal is &#12300;The new-comer named Rimuru who dares to self-proclaim as a Demon Lord&#12301;. His goal is likely&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Report. Presumably he is planning to take over territory of Demon Lord Karion and subjugate the Great Jura Forest.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Probably. I think so as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is that why Clayman&rsquo;s army has taken action?Clayman wants to take the initiative before we could act.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demon Lord Clayman is better than expected&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You! How come you are so calm in face of such an important issue! According to my source, Karion seems to have been beaten by Milim. Majins under Clayman also seemed to be commenced military operation. In other word, you are no longer being judged, this is already war ! Clayman has found the excuse to attack you all out!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even under these circumstances Ramiris, looking surprisingly serious and went on a tangent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her words caused panic in the crowd.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To some bigger nations, it&rsquo;s a tremendous deal when a Demon Lord is getting attacked.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s to be expected, after all, it may break the balance of power between the Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was expecting it myself, but it was very big surprising for the rest of the guests. This seems to be a serious topic for discussion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How dare you say that Karion-sama is a traitor! How rude&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Clayman cannot be forgiven. Nice idea of his, but I&rsquo;ll crush his ambition.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Even without Karion-sama, our army is still around. We won&rsquo;t allow Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates to just do what they want!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ones who reacted the most are no doubt the three Beastketeers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is to be expected. Since Clayman has by himself declared their master a traitor.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And according to what Ramiris said, Clayman also seems interested in taking over Karion&rsquo;s territory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are a step behind. I can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s taking action so fast&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But you can&rsquo;t expect him to be acting with good intention, so we have to clean this mess up soon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Calm down, Ramiris. I did proclaim myself to be a Demon Lord, but I didn&rsquo;t kill Myuran.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What do you mean by that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Nothing in particular, those are lies by Clayman. I&rsquo;ve expected that he would come looking to punish me by accusing me of killing Myuran.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;H-hold on a second? Do you have a single fact to back that up?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well about that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Pardon me, Demon Lord Ramiris-sama. Please allow me to speak. The rumoured to be dead Myuran who&rsquo;s Clayman&rsquo;s Majin subordinate is actually me&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I plan on thoroughly destroying Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I intended to have him misjudge the situation of Myuran&rsquo;s death, hence why I&rsquo;ve expected Clayman to make a move.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not me who got baited, instead it&rsquo;s Clayman fell for my trap.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This has nothing to do with the other Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris is astonished upon hearing Myuran&rsquo;s name, but she regained her composure shortly after.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah? Eh? That would mean&hellip;&hellip; I get it! The real criminal is Demon Lord Clayman!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think anyone can see that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris begins to brag about her deduction.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But sadly, it is an easy deduction anyone could make.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, I agree to your view, but I&rsquo;ve got something to ask too.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feel rather piteous towards her, so I played along a little.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additionally, I have some concerns with regards to some of her claims so I decide to ask.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, what&rsquo;s the matter? Why don&rsquo;t you just ask me, the famed detective Ramiris?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh shoot, I was just playing along and now she&rsquo;s gotten all cocky.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And where did this famed detective come from?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Could it be that she also had a peek at Veldora&rsquo;s manga too? No, that&rsquo;s not my concern right now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I need to ask my questions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What would the other Demon Lords do in circumstance such as this?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t hold much expectation towards her, but I&rsquo;ll ask away anyway.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, she&rsquo;s probably a good reference source since she&rsquo;s been a Demon Lord for such a long time. I asked this question based on all these considerations&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The assembly quiets down awaiting Ramiris&rsquo; answer. The others are also interested in finding out the answer to my question.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris however doesn&rsquo;t seem to care.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Uhh? How am I supposed to know. I&rsquo;ve only been told about the Banquet initiation and was told to participate!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She answered without a care.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, it&rsquo;s a waste giving her any expectation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s a little kid after all. I&rsquo;m lucky enough that she even bothered to come and report this to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Next question,</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then Ramiris, let me ask you, when will the Walpurgis Banquet be held? Do you know a specific date?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to create a plan to defeat Clayman, I need to take that into consideration.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, didn&rsquo;t I tell you? Lemme think, I think it&rsquo;s three days from now, the night of the new moon.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Three days from today, it seems earlier than I expected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be pretty difficult to try and take down Clayman in three days.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm&mdash;&mdash;How about this&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We will make a final stand with him after the Walpurgis Banquet?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I&rsquo;ve got to discuss this with everyone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, I&rsquo;ve asked Ramiris all the things I wanted. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Considering that seems to be the only thing Ramiris came here to do, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get more information out of her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And suddenly another thought hit me, so I decide to ask another question.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, so why did you come here to inform us?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm? Well, honestly, if you got killed, I don&rsquo;t know what would happen to my Beretta. That&rsquo;s why I decided to make the trip to help you. That&rsquo;s all it is. it&rsquo;s why I also plan to build an entrance to the labyrinth here, it&rsquo;s fine right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You&rsquo;d better be! Eh, how did we end up on that topic? And an entrance to labyrinth, what the heck are you trying to build here?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m glad that you came to inform me but this seems to be a completely different matter.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eheh&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! It&rsquo;s really nothing, so don&rsquo;t mind this type of small favour now!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s not even listening to me with her own speech. That attitude seems to suggest the deal is already settled.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seriously, this fairy sure is laid back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I mind it a lot, and you&rsquo;d better be cautious with your words! Also, please stop treating Beretta like some personal object you own!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&rsquo;d better not try and make any decision on your own&mdash;&mdash;I&rsquo;ll reject it without any hesitation. If you create an entrance to your labyrinth here, it will definitely lead to more trouble. And about the issue regarding Beretta, it&rsquo;s not just about me. Beretta&rsquo;s opinions matters in this too, so how could you &ldquo;decide&rdquo; just like that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The concerns that I had just sent the conversation on a pretty unexpected path.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We got into a heated debate that amounted to nothing. I can&rsquo;t really stand that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In any case, we parted on the spot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m a currently quite busy &nbsp;too, so I have no time to spare hanging around with Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Ramiris has also completed her mission, she went back to read her manga.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve also made promises with the guests from the other nations to check back with them on other information. They&rsquo;ve also accepted. Aftward, the participants of the meeting left.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuze decides to stay in the inn for the night before returning.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Now that your nation has caught the ire of the Demon Lords, do prepare yourself. Demon Lords are dangerous existences, Even though I know, Rimuru-san, that you&rsquo;re pretty powerful as well&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Says Fuze out of his worries for me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I understand him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the worst case scenario, I might make foes out of several Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Within the Ten Great Demon Lords right now, who could we expect to become our enemies?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demon Lord Karion is still missing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris seems to suggest she would be on my side, so she can be excluded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for Milim&hellip;&hellip; I&rsquo;m worrying about her the most. She must have been tricked by someone, so I&rsquo;ve got to plan for the worst.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we end up in a stalemate for real, I may end up becoming enemies with the eight other Demon Lords. Despite that, even if we are to become enemy with just Milim, we&rsquo;d better run as far as we can.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t worry, when there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s a way.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said trying to reassure Fuze.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude is also being scummy and wants to stay here for a few days, saying that he hasn&rsquo;t had the chance to chat with Elen for far too long, </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We didn&rsquo;t take him to a inn but, instead, to our luxury hotel. This facility is the pride of our nation and if we want to impress him, we will definitely have our hotel welcome the Grand Duke if we get to impress him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of Elalude, his professional and private personas are so different to see. He&rsquo;s so attached to his daughter while Elen instead only wishes to stay away from him. I do pray that he won&rsquo;t further anger Elen.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gazel also decides to spend the night so we arranged for him to stay at the hotel where Elalude is staying. I could tell from their conversation that they&rsquo;ve known each other for a long time. It is rumoured that they&rsquo;ve even fought alongside each other once, and Elalude also seems to be a very powerful mage.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is quite surprising for sure, but since they would also be communicating with our nation in the future as well, it&rsquo;s a good thing to have their friendship strengthened.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, the guests at the meeting are all important figures.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the future, these heads of nations would make an incredible impact on the way of life in the human nations. In retrospect, we are already equal in status.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though our meeting &nbsp;turned into a wild goose chase after that stubborn fairy showed up, &nbsp;it was still a fruitful meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, the meeting was dismissed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Afterward, we didn&#39;t get a chance to rest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We still have to draft our plans in case we attract the wrath of the Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After we all had a chance to have our meals, we gather at the meeting room once again.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time the only guests are the Beastketeers and Myuran.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Youmu, Grucius are preparing for their journey to come. Grucius wanted to participate too but got rejected by the Beastketeers. The two of them hold a lot of responsibility with their coming mission, so Phobio hopes they could try their best.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were planning to have Myuran preparing for it as well, but she&rsquo;s the only one here who&rsquo;s familiar with Clayman. So we decided to let her assist us and attend the meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The strange thing is that even Diablo decided to join.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Kufufufufu, I don&rsquo;t need to do any preparation.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since he&rsquo;s so adamant, I kind of have to accept his proposition. But his participation won&rsquo;t matter too much even if he joins so I&rsquo;ll just let him be.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris, for some reason, also joined in the meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, it&rsquo;s you! What&rsquo;s this all about? What is going on?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as I entered the meeting room, Ramiris flew up to me and complains.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What&rsquo;s what now?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I ask, as she begins to complain with a blush on her face.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here&rsquo;s what she had to say.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">During the break time, she was brought to the canteen.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I completely forgot about her, but there are people who came to spend time with her</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, those people are the Dryads such as Treyni-san.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They all once served under Ramiris when she was the Queen of Spirits and recognized Ramiris instantly. Then Ramiris received a warm welcome from them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That sounds great.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah! It&rsquo;s superb! That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m staying here too, Rimuru!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems Ramiris has taking a liking to this town. This Demon Lord who&rsquo;s been alone and without subordinate gets all cocky once she receives some admirations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, Ramiris was touring the town accompanied by others.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was mesmerized by all the sights and decided to stay here from now on.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I told you to not make any wild decision on your own! Besides, Treyni-san and the other Dryads are the moderators of the Great Jura Forest. They live in a different place than us, so they can&rsquo;t spend their every day accompanying you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three Dryads sisters were looking really delighted while waiting behind Ramiris during the conversation. I glance towards them and continue to lecture Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Ramiris won&rsquo;t listen.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You meanie&mdash;&mdash;! Isn&rsquo;t it great, no matter what happens, you get to enjoy assistance from me, the strongest, world dominating, Ramiris-sama&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I ever need your help, it would probably&mdash;&mdash;No, I shouldn&rsquo;t say it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I tell her my honest opinion it would probably make Ramiris cry.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama, we will take care of Ramiris-sama, please think of it in a positive light.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;Please consider it!&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only Ramiris, even Treyni-san and her sisters begins asking me for this favour.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, no matter how you look at it, all she seems to be is a troublemaker. If Ramiris ends up just casually running around here while we get more communication with humans in the future, she will definitely become an eyesore.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm&mdash;&mdash;I&rsquo;ll need to think on this request some more.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I understand, I&rsquo;ll take it into consideration&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Really! Sasuga Rimuru, such a doll!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll figure out what type of situations we may run into when Ramiris comes to this town later.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now I&rsquo;ve got other issues to deal with at hand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Ramiris quieting down, we can finally commence our military meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Well then, I know everyone must be exhausted from the long meetings, but I hope you will all endure it for a just bit more. Right now we have two subjects to discuss. First being the&#12302;Battle against Clayman&#12303; and the other is the&#12302;Walpurgis Banquet&#12303;. Thanks to the information provided by Ramiris-chan here, I know we&rsquo;ve been targeted. Let&rsquo;s first hear Souei&rsquo;s report and draft an attack plan. Souei, please tell us about Clayman&rsquo;s army. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes sir!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After my opening speech, Souei begins the report.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as we were having the meeting, Clayman&rsquo;s army seemed to be on the move.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve been resting in MIlim&rsquo;s territory and entering combat formation. Apart from that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;The one leading the army doesn&rsquo;t seem to be Clayman himself. The commander has brought several Majins with unusual amount of magicules, but they are about to be one the same level as the Beastketeers. It is too weak to be Demon Lord Clayman.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei concludes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, that guy&rsquo;s sure arrogant&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;If we are talking about Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates that can rival the Beastketeers, there are three that come to my mind&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So many! I see no matter how despicable he is, he is still a Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are &#12300;Middle Finger&#12301; Yamza, &#12300;Index finger&#12301; Adalman, and&#12300;The thumb&#12301; The Nine-headed Beast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These three seem to be the members of Clayman&rsquo;s proud organization known as the&#12300;Five-Fingers&#12301;. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">B</span><span class="c4">y the way, Myuran apparently was the &#12300;Ring Finger&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additionally, there is &#12300;Pinkie Finger&#12301;Piorra. That guy seems to rarely show up given his role as an intelligence collector.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m more concerned about the Moderate Jester Association, but Myuran claims to know nothing about them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Clayman is the type of Demon Lords that won&rsquo;t even trust his subordinates. I won&rsquo;t be surprised if he has ordered someone else to overlook the operation.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is he like the audience watching a puppet show?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It may end up like the Orc Lord incident where people are operating even without the knowledge of Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates&rsquo; involvement. We need to be cautious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;About that, Myuran, who is the commander?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei saw a slim Majin and reported that he&rsquo;s the commanding general. &#12300;Telepathy Net&#12301; sure is convenient for sharing information with everyone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;He is Yamza. The Magic Frost Swordsman Yamza. He is a despicable and cruel scumbag, but nonetheless a powerful individual. I didn&rsquo;t get along well with him given the fact that he voluntarily pledged his loyalty towards Clayman.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the commander is Yamza.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From Myuran&rsquo;s description, he seems to be the strongest Majin within the Five-Fingers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Clayman gave him a priceless magic sword possessing the power of </span><span class="c4">freezing</span><sup><a href="#cmnt35" id="cmnt_ref35">[ai]</a></sup><span class="c0">, and the title of Magic Frost Swordsman which is a title that spread extensively across the land.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, his capabilities are still unknown.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for Clayman&rsquo;s army, it consist of thirty thousand Majins led by Yamza.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Each and every one of which possesses a different ability.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From Souei&rsquo;s observation, eighty percents of them are of Rank B. The remainings ones are almost all A-. Some of the higher ranked officers may even reach Rank A or on par with Gelmud in terms of power. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although they are a lot more powerful in comparison to the Falmas Army I eliminated, there is still little to fear.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problem lies with the commander Yamza or rather, it disappoints me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Aren&rsquo;t they a little too weak?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From our standpoint, there are more than twenty thousand people who have taken refuge here from Beast Kingdom Yuurazania. Half of them are capable of combat, making up roughly ten thousand people. They are already Rank B under normal circumstances, they would even evolve to A- after their beastilization, which makes them an incredible force to be reckoned with.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the Knight Order from Falmas Kingdom averaged out to Rank B with their magic fortification. It just goes to show how strong the Beast Kingdom warriors are.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not to mention the a huge gap between the basic abilities between Human and Beastmen.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just these people alone can form a huge combat force, besides, there are other available combatants spread around. After they retreated from the capital, they reunited with Beastmen members from the nearby tribes scattered over the land. The veterans from Beast King Army took command of these individuals and rearranged them into capable force hiding near the area. With these forces combined, there will be an additional ten thousand soldiers. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That makes around twenty-thousand Ranked A- warriors. That indeed is an impressive amount of combat prowess, as expected from a Demon Lord who dominates his land.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;This is indeed strange. No matter how strong this Majin Yamza is, us Beastketeers will not lose to him. And even if we have less men in our army as compared to them, we still have an overwhelming advantage in terms of combat abilities of our warriors.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right. We are quite confident with leading soldiers to the war!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Do they think can look down on us because Karion-sama has passed away? No way, Clayman isn&rsquo;t be that stupid&hellip;.. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis agrees with my views.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio and Suphia also followed up to express their views, believing that the Clayman&rsquo;s army won&rsquo;t much of a threat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">If that&rsquo;s the case</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this moment, Benimaru mumbles:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wait a second? Could it be that Clayman never intended to target this town?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, we may have been misled.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This town has constantly been a target, and with Ramiris telling us that we&rsquo;ve become a target of Clayman&rsquo;s, we might have been misled into believing that &nbsp;this town is his target.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was planning to initiate a pincer-attack on Clayman&rsquo;s army when he passes through Yuurazania in order to beat him&hellip;.. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But things aren&rsquo;t as simple as I expected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Does he want to attack the Beast Kingdom? There are only refugees plus the ten thousand warriors in the area. Even if it has higher quality of warriors compared to the enemies, they still can&rsquo;t handle the immense difference in numbers.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It does make sense.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to Souei, his army is staying in Milim&rsquo;s territory for now, but his army has already began reorganization. Tomorrow, if not the day after, he would likely march on to the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is unlikely they would take any action tonight, but I have to consider that as a possibility as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;This might mean that clayman doesn&rsquo;t know about us given we&rsquo;ve been extra cautious of him&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld calmly states, but I won&rsquo;t to put too much expectation on it. We must plan for the worst-case scenario in order to remain adaptable to various situations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;If he is indeed heading to this town, Clayman won&rsquo;t ignore the many dangers lying behind him. So he would likely only commence that operation after getting rid of all the threats.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Myuran concludes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, that&rsquo;s exactly how I would go about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is that the case, eh, getting rid of threats?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi, do you mean then&hellip;&hellip;. that Clayman plans to kill all of the remaining Beast Kingdom warriors?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It may be passable if he&rsquo;s only killing the warriors but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer. Prediction towards Demon Lord Clayman has updated. The chances of his goal being to awaken as&#12300;True Demon Lord&#12301; is one hundred percent. Prediction: He would not include this town in his plan. But his method is sloppy and in addition with incorrect deductions, it is most certain that he would decimate all life forces within the borders of the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania&mdash;&mdash;&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is that so? Of course, he is planning on killing everyone without mercy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I may sound rather hypocritical saying this, but, his ruthless method really appalls me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is very cautious with his actions, he may even have eyes on this town as part of his extended road map. In other words, any reinforcement I send would likely be discovered by him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And even without considering that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Clayman has very strong intelligence gathering capabilities. That&rsquo;s why he must have already known that the Beastketeers and Karion&rsquo;s army has evacuated to this town. Besides, it will take at least two days to move from here to the Beast Kingdom&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are at a complete disadvantage here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Alvis said, Clayman has seen through everything.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We won&rsquo;t make it in time even if we deploy the Rank B equivalent warriors&rsquo; regiments and move out without any sleep or rest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I want to have all of my subordinates take part in this fight, but by the time we arrive at the battlefield, the people from Beast Kingdom would likely have already been slaughtered&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Would Clayman awaken if everyone is massacred?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer. Despite the lack of efficiency, it will grant him a large amount of souls. Clayman&rsquo;s rate of success in awakening&mdash;&mdash;Seventy-eight percent. Additionally, his chances of success would increase if he has obtained the required amount of soul within a shorter time-span.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is becoming a really difficult situation, I must stop him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not even for the citizens of the Beast Kingdom whom I&rsquo;ve never met, but for myself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve never met those citizens, yet they were willing to forge a friendship between our nations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Trust is more valuable than gold, and kindness should be repaid with kindness. That&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t go easy on my interventions here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Benimaru, go and stop them.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I assigned him an extremely challenging task, yet he only responds with a smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Aye, I&rsquo;ll do just that&mdash;&mdash;No, it would be my pleasure to carry out your orders!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru, he is pretty obedient by heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He often goes back to his original tone of voice whenever he gets excited.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he believes that there is a difference between his professional and private life, so he is always very respectful to me in front of others&hellip;&hellip;..but you don&rsquo;t have to treat our current meeting as that important.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s indeed unpleasant to be looked down upon, and I understand you are doing so to prevent that from happening, but&hellip;.. In this country, I doubt there is anyone who looks down on me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s like, performing better than your senior would probably result in a awkward relationship.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">People realize this type of things when they enter the society.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I decide to steel my heart and give Benimaru the order as his superior.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm. As such, the defence battle of Beast Kingdom Yuurazania is officially commencing. Let&rsquo;s talk about how to win the battle with Benimaru acting as the key player.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;Understood!&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone bows unanimously. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the three Beastketeer also joined in, it seems I did sound quite imposing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Clayman is far more cunning than I expected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps the Walpurgis Banquet on the night of three days later is also part of his plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is probably planning to slaughter the people of the Beast Kingdom before any other Demon Lords intervene and plan to report it to them afterward.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It will take some time to unite the local combatants, and if things continue as it is, the warrior groups would be defeated one by one even with putting up a much futile resistance.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And what would follow would likely be the massacre of the residents who are incapable of fighting back&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since we&rsquo;ve decided to stop this, everyone was eager to voice their opinions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone wants to gather forces and head out immediately. But, no one spoke up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone here knows the importance of information gathering.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason why I&rsquo;ve announced my intentions of taking down Clayman but made no immediate actions is because I&rsquo;ve been waiting for Souei to report back. In addition, our soldiers are currently switching gears and gathering resources at the town plaza.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kaijin, Garm and Doldo are using their craftsmanship to help create new weapons and armors for them. Those are the new gear everyone would be switching to in preparation for war.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So there is no use rushing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We need to know where our enemies are, the structure of their army, and their number, as well as their intent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We won&rsquo;t make much of anything by simply marching in blindly without any knowledge on these matters.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now, our discussion will soon conclude for a while.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We&rsquo;ve confirmed their force to be there. We will definitely win if we are to make it in time. But the problem lies in how we&rsquo;re going to get there. We have to buy some time or we won&rsquo;t make it as things stand right now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How about we send in the Goblin Riders and Gabiru&rsquo;s forces first to distract them for a while?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, it would be pointless. I&rsquo;ve sent men to investigate the geography of the Beast Kingdom. It mostly consists of plains and small hills. It&rsquo;s not a great place for ambush tactics. It may be more effective to make an air based assault, but a mere hundred soldier assault would barely do anything.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru regained his cool.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we are to lay an ambush, the orchards near the bank of the big river would be a good place, but the many hills there that are beneficial for water drainage makes it too eye-catching. So the geography is also unsuitable for having our troops perform an ambush attack. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hakurou&rsquo;s suggestion got rejected, so far Benimaru is making the correct judgement calls. I heard Suphia whisper: &#12300;What in the world, when did he investigate our nation&rsquo;s geography&hellip;..&#12301; I&rsquo;m curious about that as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s likely that he sent someone to do the investigation when he was acting as the head of the diplomatic team. Should I see this as him being overly cautious or reliable in work&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia doesn&rsquo;t seem to be holding a grudge against it, so I&rsquo;ll just pretend I didn&rsquo;t hear that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;There are only four hundred Beastmen troops that are specialized in speed. There are less than a hundred too consisting of the rare Bird-beast type soldiers. They would be sacrificed in vain if we are to send them first.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis is also worried.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It also doesn&rsquo;t mean that they won&rsquo;t be tired from flying, and even with Gabiru&rsquo;s troops, there are barely two hundred of them. So sending them first really won&rsquo;t do much to help.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The location has a clear field of view, so there is no use sending smaller units.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a result, we went in circles with our attack plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have to give it our all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We can have the soldiers all over the location to find the residents and help take them refuge.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once they enter the Tempest Federation, Treyni-san and her companions can act as support to raise their chances of survival. Then, we will have the speed-oriented units engage in guerilla warfare to facilitate in their escape.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We will then have the slower ground troops to both accept the refugees and fend off Clayman&rsquo;s army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a race against time with much luck involved, but we can&rsquo;t think up of any better ideas.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why, in order to prevent things from escalating in the wrong direction, we (Tempest) will engage with the enemy too.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fellow executives&mdash;&mdash;Benimaru, Shuna, Souei, Shion, Geld and Ranga&mdash;&mdash;They&rsquo;ve all learned the extra skill &#12300;Dimension Transportation&#12301; and can manipulate the &#12300;Teleportation Door&#12301; that connects two different spatial coordinates.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo seems to be also capable of this, but he&rsquo;s moving out with Youmu&rsquo;s party, so there is no chance for him to show off this time. If the situation worsens, I would call him back. But, I wish to resolve this situation with the seven people in total including myself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though I could take on the army by myself, showing off in battle is a big taboo.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Especially since Shuna is not good at face-to-face combat. I&rsquo;ve sent Hakurou and Gabiru to protect her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It can&rsquo;t be helped, this is what we have to do. As long as we are able to buy more time, we can prevent casualties. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if I can just somehow use teleportation magic to transport them there&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mumble that to myself as a joke.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we can use magic to teleport our troops there, it will resolve the issue immediately. But even with my &#12300;Dimension Manipulation&#12301;, it is impossible to transport a thousand-men army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer. Teleportation magic can transport goods at relatively low cost. It can directly connects different dimensions to the coordinates of the teleportation location. This would induce large amount of magicules to surround the area, unsuitable for transportation of organic matters. However, by using &#12300;Barrier&#12301; to protect their bodies, it will mitigate the effects during teleportation. This is the principle of teleportation magic&mdash;&mdash; &#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmmm&hellip;&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">So that&rsquo;s the difference between teleportation and </span><span class="c4">transference</span><sup><a href="#cmnt36" id="cmnt_ref36">[aj]</a></sup><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;..The key difference is to have additional magical protection applied to the objects being teleported, so it uses more magicules.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ehh? That would mean&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12298;&mdash;&mdash;In other words, for Majins or </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s who possesses resistance towards magicules or if they are able to cast &#12300;Barrier&#12301; on their own, teleportation would become feasible for them. Alternatively, one can also cast the complete teleportation technique that invokes protection on the target.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That would mean as long as the target possess strength to withstand a large amount of magicule exposure, they can then pass through the special transportation dimension. This seems to be the same principle as the extra skill &#12300;Dimensional Transportation&#12301;, I&rsquo;ve got to keep an eye on this matter.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be more clear, it would be possible to even teleport people if the subjects being teleported are completely protected beforehand. No no no, that would be the actual way to use transportation magic, but even if that&rsquo;s the case, wouldn&rsquo;t it still cost a lot of magicules? Plus there isn&rsquo;t enough time for me to modify it to the point of being able to accomodate an army of over ten-thousand of soldiers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer: The magic has been developed. Additionally, with the combined use of &#12300;Dimensional Manipulation&#12301;, its magicule cost has been successfully reduced.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wow, this is really impressive!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What&rsquo;s with this sudden growth of Raphael-sama?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It has already developed magic and skill for me even before I requested them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of that, after I awakened as a Demon Lord, my skill has all evolved dramatically and I&rsquo;ve not been able to familiarize myself with them at all. If it was not for &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301;, I would have been wasting away the potential of those skills.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raphael was able to develop magic likely due to the effect of &#12300;Ability Change&#12301;. Regardless, it is more than desirable to me. It has even prepared the magic I&rsquo;ve been dreaming off, simply perfect.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama, using teleportation magic to transport army would be too risky&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna tries to persuade me as she also seems to be aware of its dangers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, that part has been resolved just now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed, Shuna is right. But just now, I&rsquo;ve developed a new magic!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m beginning to sympathize with Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Had I not evolved, you likely would have emerged as the victor.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh&hellip;&hellip;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Nani!?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;developed just now?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone appears to be surprised and looks at me with respect.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nods in response, and ask them:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It all depends on your resolves now. I could use this magic and transport the entire army to their destination in one go. However, it would be my first time casting such magic, so no there&rsquo;s guarantee of your personal safety, nor do I have any time for experimentation. If that&rsquo;s the case, would you still be willing to trust me?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have faith in &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Raphael says it&rsquo;s fine, then it won&rsquo;t be a problem.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I don&rsquo;t know what everyone else thinks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are they willing to believe me like this and entrust their lives to me?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You don&rsquo;t have to worry. I&rsquo;ve sworn loyalty to you. Since I am a servant under Rimuru-sama, I shall sacrifice myself even if that&rsquo;s your desire. Your order will never trouble us and we are all aware of that.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru responded with a wild smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The veterans all agree with his view and even the new-comer Diablo, as he nods with a bizarre monstrous smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from that, the Beastketeers also followed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We believe you. We&rsquo;ve come to seek your help so there&rsquo;s no way we&rsquo;ll doubt you Rimuru-sama&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed. I&rsquo;ve been saved by you once already. My subordinates are all aware of that, and they certainly won&rsquo;t complain,&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ara ara, it seems like I can&rsquo;t disagree with this. My troop happens to be the slowest, and I do hope Rimuru-sama would give us a helping hand.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia came to that conclusion without hesitation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio has had faith in me from the start,</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Alvis, who initially was doubtful and hesitant, but nonetheless chose to believe in me in the end.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then your lives have, here and now, been entrusted to me! This way we can surprise Clayman. The rest of it will be up to you, you must achieve victory!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;Yes Sir&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brave smiles begin to emerge on everyone&rsquo;s face.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If our troops move now, their victory would be guaranteed. No matter how tightly Clayman has been surveilling the town, he won&rsquo;t be able to discover the movements of our army now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ve got victory in our grip.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naturally, everyone rediscovers their calmness now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I give the task of redesigning the attack plan to Benimaru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Souei has brought some updates to his report.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He says that about a hundred of the Worshipers of Dragon hava joined Clayman&rsquo;s army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;A hundred? If that&rsquo;s the only people joining, it shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does Benimaru know of the background of these Worshipers of Dragon?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh yeah, Souei, who are these worshipers of dragon?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m not sure about it so I decide to ask directly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;To your question, they worship dragon, that is the Dragon Princess Milim-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, I see, so they are subordinates of Milim. Wait, but Milim said she doesn&rsquo;t have any subordinates. They may actually be worshiping her on their own volition.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This organization don&rsquo;t seem to have a name for their nation, yet they have a total population of around hundred thousand. They probably have been in peaceful co-existence with nature and leading a quiet life.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman seems to also be watching over them by crossing their domain and having them accompanying the army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei wasn&rsquo;t able to dig any deper, so the Worshipers of Dragon are temporarily listed as part of the individuals under observation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I order Souei to resume the surveillance over Clayman&rsquo;s army and find an appropriate location for the deployment of our army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, &nbsp;the subject of&#12300;Battle against Clayman&#12301; has concluded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alright, now for the next topic in line.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In regards to the &#12300;Walpurgis Banquet&#12301; reported by Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Beastketeers left the meeting room first, having to inform their subordinates about our decision. They trust me and agreed to using the teleportation magic. So they probably went to inform their soldiers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Myuran also followed close after, since the issue at hand now is our problem and doesn&rsquo;t require her input any longer.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her job is to assist Youmu.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that there are only my close companions left in the room, I got to relax a fair bit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Given the circumstances, the atmosphere of the meeting has changed drastically, I&rsquo;ve decided to just chat about what we think without any restraint.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;If I could locate Clayman&rsquo;s location, I could just use &#12302;Dimensional Transportation&#12303; to hop over and give him a round or two of beating to finish things up.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With his army on the move, there can&rsquo;t be that much left at his base. So I won&rsquo;t have to worry about the attack. I only need to move with my subordinates and we may be able to put an end to him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the flip side, if I am to attack some place, we need to make sure we don&#39;t let down the defense of this town.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I need to spend more time thinking about this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Apologies. There emerged multiple areas that possessed a high magicule concentration. We deemed it dangerous so we didn&rsquo;t pass through.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei started to apologize to me as he reports, but it&rsquo;s alright. After all even with his &#12300;Clone&#12301; active, he still had to act cautiously. It will be bad if the enemy got hold of our movement if we just end up moving into a trap.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemy&rsquo;s base of operations may be hidden behind this fog bank, so knowing this is enough.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How about we send out a few people to investigate their base using the weak points in enemy force?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But, wouldn&rsquo;t Clayman be attending Walpurgis Banquet? There&rsquo;s a chance we might miss him.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru expresses his view though Shuna rejects it calmly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru made an awkward expression in response.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It makes sense. In addition, if we underestimate the enemy force, our vanguard would get overwhelmed instead resulting in their pull back. This would render our efforts rather meaningless. I think Benimaru-sama should focus on leading the army instead.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hakurou delivered the final blow and ended the conversation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Are there any other ideas?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyhow, let&rsquo;s hear about everyone else&rsquo;s ideas.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes! Shion begins to raise her hand energetically while looking at me...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I gave her permission to speak up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How about we attack the site of Walpurgis Banquet directly and kill off not only Clayman, but any other Demon Lords who dare to disagree with us?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She says with sparkling eyes (:ShionSparklings: (&#65417;&#9685;&#12526;&#9685;)&#65417;*:&#12539;&#65439;&#10023;).</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s my fault for asking for advice from an idiot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The annoyance is almost causing veins to emerge on my temple, but I&rsquo;ve endured it. This seemed to have happened before.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shion, how are you going to do that? I mean, can&rsquo;t you provide some more practical ideas?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Killing Clayman alone is tough enough as it is, how are we supposed to fight all the other Demon Lords together?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the very least we should take them down individually&mdash;&mdash;I scolded Shion strictly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said, she loses all her spirit and looks very down.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s really no helping with her, guess I&rsquo;ll play along a little.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I went on a tangent (to praise her), after all I still adore Shion a fair bit</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But, maybe rushing in may actually be a good suggestion.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion then raises her face with excitement written all over her face.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What a realist approach.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;m just asking, Ramiris, but is it possible for me to participate?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I asked Ramiris who&rsquo;s more experienced with it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh? Do you want to participate, Rimuru?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, it&rsquo;s just for reference. Since Clayman is going to participate in the meeting, so if I take the initiative, it might make things more interesting.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since I&rsquo;ve already been targeted, striking first may actually be a good idea.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Preemptively striking is tactically basic, but Clayman most definitely would be surprised with me showing up to where he would least expect me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It might not be a good idea to use violence in a meeting, but I&rsquo;d like to try it first.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm&mdash;&mdash;It should be fine. However, you can only bring at most two people as companions!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bringing a bunch of subordinates would only cause unnecessary trouble, so I can&rsquo;t take too many fo them with me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve heard story of some newly enrolled Demon Lord that tried to be imposing and brought hundreds of his close subordinates to the meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">This action uncanningly enraged a Demon Lord who&rsquo;s been mad at (her) territory having been wiped out at the time.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">That Demon Lord&rsquo;s anger probably could have been vented on anyone. </span><span class="c4">And so he ended up kil</span><sup><a href="#cmnt37" id="cmnt_ref37">[ak]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that incident, the meeting forbids Majins with insufficient strength to participate. And among the Demon Lords, they may only take two companions along.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this would also mean that there has been that type of disputes in the past. So it should be fine for me to go as someone looking for trouble.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Barging in and accusing Clayaman directly, I should seriously consider this idea.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What do you think? Wouldn&rsquo;t my participation in it be very interesting?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Kufufufufu, this proposal is wonderful. Would you allow me to accompany you&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Bastard, Diablo! I will be the one to accompany Rimuru-Sama. I won&rsquo;t let you have him!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the two of them begin to argue again. (Diablo and Shion)</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be suicide bringing these two along, but I wasn&rsquo;t planning to have the two of them in the same place.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And just as this idea was raised&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Since we will eventually fight against all the Demon Lords anyways, let&rsquo;s just kill them all. After all, shouldn&rsquo;t it be enough to just have Rimuru-sama as the only Demon Lord?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And even Diablo begins to spout out nonsense.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion agrees completely and begins to nod her head excitedly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right! And here I thought you are an idiot. That&rsquo;s some very profound views from a newbie! I didn&rsquo;t expect you to give voice to all my thoughts!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Should I see them as sharing a tacit relationship or being on bad term?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I have to pick someone, I think Shion is more brain dead, but&hellip;... both of them seem equally bent on beating up the other Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How did things end up like this?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking around, I find several people at the scene agreeing with their views.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some people are being cautious, while some are highly ecstatic, even giving off a killing intent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">For some reason, the number of warmongers among us has only increased.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that method is way too reckless. So I have to interjected quickly to bring the discussion back on track.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wait a second, don&rsquo;t get ahead yourselves now. We haven&rsquo;t settled on things yet. And as for Diablo, I&rsquo;ve assigned you on the mission concerning Falmas Kingdom. So there&rsquo;s no way I can bring you with me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I-Indeed. Understood.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems Diablo thinks the mission regarding the Falmas Kingdom is rather simple. He seems confident enough but I hope he won&rsquo;t suffer a Waterloo if he underestimates his enemies.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With some regrets and a mix of joy in being assigned a mission by me, Diablo made a mixed expression.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But, wouldn&rsquo;t it be too dangerous still?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna&rsquo;s tone gives off a sense of worry.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, these are the opinion we hold.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right. Moreover wouldn&rsquo;t it be more efficient to try to attack Clayman&rsquo;s base when he&rsquo;s not there? Hence there&rsquo;s no reason to attend the Walpurgis &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld speaks up cautiously, seemingly agreeing with Shuna&rsquo;s views.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems to be the more viable tactic, avoiding risk and fight winnable battle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld is also quite eager to fight, but he is not as reckless. It&rsquo;s very delightful to hear so many opinions under much consideration. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there are other reasons as to why I&rsquo;m considering attending the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Something is concerning me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, Rimuru-sama is worrying about the intent of Demon Lord Milim-sama. It is unthinkable that Milim-sama would betray us, so she&rsquo;s most likely being manipulated by Clayman. Or she has some plan of her own, but at the very least she did in fact attack Demon Lord Karion-sama. So attending the Walpurgis Banquet to find out the truth behind it wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad idea.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed. Milim-sama being one of people who initiated the Banquet is also concerning. Hence there must be some sort of conspiracy behind it, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Surprisingly, Benimaru&rsquo;s comment aligns perfectly with my thoughts while Souei also points out my concerns.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sasuga Benimaru and Souei. They have the same views as me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, Milim following Clayman&rsquo;s every orders, there&rsquo;s no way that that would have happened in this world. Because Milim is way too stubborn!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Do you have any right to criticise her, Ramiris? That thought popped into my head, but she and I shared the same view.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Milim-sama would never betray Rimuru-sama. Even though this is just my hunch, but I still pretty sure that I&rsquo;m right.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion asserts.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right, we don&rsquo;t have any proof either&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">But I also dont think that she&rsquo;ll betray us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; also reached the same conclusion even though it couldn&rsquo;t be hundred-percent sure without sufficient information to back up this claim, there&rsquo;s no way such a thing would happen without a drastic change in situation. I decided to have faith in Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even if that&rsquo;s the case, I can&rsquo;t just leave it this way.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I also agree with all of your points and I don&rsquo;t think Milim would betray me. Therefore, something must have happened. As Ramiris said, let&rsquo;s assume Clayman isn&rsquo;t the culprit here, but I still think it is highly likely that he has been the puppet master behind all of these events thus far. So I&rsquo;ll take Benimaru&rsquo;s advice and participate in the Walpurgis Banquet to investigate how things were there&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Something would definitely happen in between the session.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the worst case scenario, Milim may attack us by the end of Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is what concerns me the most, and the reason why I think it&rsquo;s still dangerous even if we just leave it as it is.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fighting Clayman alone won&rsquo;t really be a problem, however, the goal is to avoid engagement with Milim in any form of confrontation as much as possible.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;See? I told you I&rsquo;m right! Indeed, indeed, everything has been expected by the famed detective Ramiris. If that&rsquo;s the case, we just have to go and beat the crap out of Clayman!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I thought I was successful in leading the topic and concluded the most dangerous conversation&mdash;&mdash;yet now Ramiris begins shouting some bizzare nonsense.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Also, what even is the deal here? Why are there so many powerful Majins just running around here? You should just let Beretta be my servant since you have so many strong subordinates already!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And she then dared to say that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris sure is being quite outrageous. She&rsquo;s only gotten more bold after discovering the strength of my companions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I didn&rsquo;t plan on giving Beretta up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But more importantly, we need to consider what Beretta wants in this situation, not just what Ramiris wants.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, some of my subordinates seem to share the same sentiments with Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I see, that sounds reasonable. Very well, I shall go kill him. I shall return shortly&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh, hold on hold on, calm down now Shion. Let&rsquo;s prepare first before going, you too, Benimaru and Souei!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seriously,</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The situation turned into something of a mess like this as soon as I decided to participate in the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru have to engage with Clayman&rsquo;s army, same goes for Souei.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the military meeting continues, I need to assess cautiously about the candidates as to who will be my two companions to the Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the candidates I&rsquo;m looking for are&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I suddenly felt the pressure from a sharp stare coming from behind my back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can figure it out with your joint that it&rsquo;s Shion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She would probably go crazy if I didn&rsquo;t take her with me. It seems that it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly hard for Benimaru to keep her in check, so I guess I&rsquo;d have to take care of this mess.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What&rsquo;s more, Shion almost died by Clayman&rsquo;s ploy&mdash;&mdash;or should I say that she was literally killed over it&mdash;&mdash;hence, this may be a great chance for revenge, that&rsquo;s why I wish to bring her along.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that, Shion has been selected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other one is rather hard to choose, but Ranga seems like a good candidate.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was planning to have him hide in my shadow, but it will be problematic if the location has some special barrier similar to &#12300;Holy Purification Barrier&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I found out that Ranga has been listening in all this time anticipating to join, so I suppose I should take Ranga too.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is a competent bodyguard after all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that, I made my decision to bring Shion and Ranga with me. Both of whom have the ability of &#12300;Dimensional Transportation&#12301;which is one of my reason for bringing them since they can easily escape with me if anything happens.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as they&rsquo;ve experienced the newly made barrier inspired by &#12300;Holy Purification Barrier&#12301;, they should have a good chance of escaping even in the worst case scenario.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three of us should move out together and head straight to the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Milim is indeed being unfortunately controlled, the next thing being destroyed would most likely be this town. That is a possibility that I need to prevent no matter the cost.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I will not let this town suffer once again.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Let&rsquo;s participate then. I&rsquo;ll bring Shion and Ranga along. Ramiris, could you help convey the message that I wish to participate?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, I understand!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris answers without hesitation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then she seems to have initiated a certain Demon Lord special communication line to inform the rest of the Demon Lords about my participation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems like some sort of high level skill that could communicate through the interference of space.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I observe her looking impressed for a while, and at the moment, someone walks towards me while laughing loudly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s Veldora. It seems that he&rsquo;s finished with his manga and has been listening to our conversation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Gahahahaha! Yes, you are finally taking things seriously! Although you&#39;re not being a good friend, RImuru, bring me along as well! You don&rsquo;t have to worry about those Demon Lords at all with my company!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He makes such proud statement in full confidence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of that, I&rsquo;ve completely forgotten about the fact that he&rsquo;s here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, I don&rsquo;t plan to bring Veldora along.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh well, don&rsquo;t get ahead of yourself now, Veldora. I hope you can stay in the town and focus on defense.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Nani! Wasn&rsquo;t I supposed to be going along too? Take my words, I won&rsquo;t lose to those Demon Lords at all!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With my words, Veldora received a huge surprise, probably not expecting that I would say this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Defending this town is also an important mission, perhaps the most important task.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are marching all of our forces to take a final stand against Clayman. There will only be the police force led by Rigur present back here, whose numbers are pretty small, as well as Shion&rsquo;s subordinates.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The strategy is based on the precondition that Veldora remained here to defend the town.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the Western Saints Church is to send out invasion force, Veldora alone should be able to handle them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s how it is, so I hope you can stay back for the defense.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Uhh&hellip;&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seems unable to accept it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It can&rsquo;t be helped, I guess I&rsquo;ll tell him the real reason&mdash;&mdash;I was just about to speak up before Ramiris, who finished the communication, begins to shout.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hey, Rimuru! They&rsquo;ve approved your participation, but aren&rsquo;t you being too mean here? It will be okay if I have master to participate as my companion (underling). It&rsquo;s safer for me as well!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, with that being said it does sound reasonable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But from my perspective, Ramiris&rsquo; intention is crystal clear. She&rsquo;s trying to bring Veldora and Beretta there to brag.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think Veldora has also seen through her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;......huh, no? I don&rsquo;t want to go as you bodyguard at all.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He rejects without hesitation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;AWH REALLY&mdash;&mdash;&#65281;EHHHH how could this&hellip;.. You are so cruel, master!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, what&rsquo;s with this master thing about Veldora&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris and Veldora seemed to have grown a friendship because of manga.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s certain that the two have good relationship, but in terms of their power, it seems Ramiris is one-sidedly trying to get on good term with Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s a good thing anyway.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our focus should be us participating in the Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">For some of the Demon Lords, they may find it more troublesome to go around human towns. But that&rsquo;s just to my advantage.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Veldora, we&rsquo;ve been intentionally releasing fake news about you. You should know about that from the meeting we just finished.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It could have been a way to have him follow Ramiris as a servant. But honestly, I think it would lower the guards of the other Demon Lords to make them think that Veldora didn&#39;t follow along.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, Hmmhmm, of course I know.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, it seems he doesn&rsquo;t know.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he is pretending that he paid attention to the meeting. He must have gotten addicted to reading manga.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it&rsquo;s then much easier now to make up stories for him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Besides, Clayman must be thinking that the Majin Rimuru is a bluffing scum who relies on Veldora&rsquo;s name&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What! That bastard Clayman, we&rsquo;ll see about it!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;He... this ignorant bug, I shall go myself to personally take him out.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ahhh, calm down you guys. Rimuru-sama is just giving an example.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was halfway through my sentence before Shion and Diablo started acting all angry in my stead.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You guys really can&rsquo;t keep your cool now, can you?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru was a bit mad for a moment, but since the other two spoke first, he got to regain his composure.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t get riled up now, Benimaru&rsquo;s right, that was just an example. Anyway, if we bring Veldora to the meeting and cause them to be on alert, wouldn&rsquo;t it be pointless? &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, so it&rsquo;s like that.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I understand now, sasuga Rimuru-sama!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Gufufufufu, anyone who dares to insult Rimuru-sama is unforgivable. I wanted to exterminate him by my own hands, but perhaps I shall allow Shion senpai perform the act instead.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So you want to lead the opponent into lowering their guard in order to drive the negotiation in our favour, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora who realizes my point nod and says so while Shion praises without using her brain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo is again making some dangerous statement, but he does think the best candidate to take down Clayman in this case is Shion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru looks quite happy having read my thought.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But, shouldn&rsquo;t we try to avoid danger?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna asks me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her comment seems to have resonated with others as Geld and Gabiru nods in agreement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Even if you are considered by the enemies as an individual to be cautious of, should you not perhaps focus on your personal safety?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Says Hakurou to me with Souei agreeing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, I can see where everyone&rsquo;s worries is coming from.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said, I&rsquo;ve also assessed that part.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s alright. I can use my skill &#12302;Storm Dragon Summon&#12303; to call out Veldora at any time. That wouldn&rsquo;t count as a companion to the meeting, right? That&rsquo;s why, since I can seek help at any point I wish, I hope you will defend the town quietly before that happens. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said so proudly with a face as if saying &#12300;How about that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My companions all seemed very impressed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;GA&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;HAHAHA! So I am actually the Hero for the finale.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora is feeling good about himself again.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as you don&rsquo;t object, I won&rsquo;t say a thing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s so cunning&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris pouts by herself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Baka, Ramiris. You should praise me for being so smart.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris is still upset while Veldora whispers to himself &#12300;So that&rsquo;s the case.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I take the chance to bring up one more thing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Besides, now you&rsquo;ve got an extra spot for a companion.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon hearing this, the Ramiris&rsquo; eyes along with the rest of my companions begin to glow.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You know me too well, Rimuru! Very well, who are you sending in as my servant?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris seems satisfied with her servant number increased to two. Given how she looks now, she&rsquo;s really just trying to show off to other Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyhow, it&rsquo;s alright as long as she accepts.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One more spot&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I realize that everyone who hasn&rsquo;t been selected has been looking at me nervously, however, this servant must be strong enough.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I am being honest, Benimaru is the best choice, but the war can&rsquo;t be fought while I am not present, so Benimaru has to make up for it. Thus I have to select someone else.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Which would mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Sorry to keep everyone waiting, I choose Haku&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Please hold on a second!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Someone interrupted me as I was halfway through nominating Hakurou. It was the woman standing behind Ramiris&mdash;&mdash;Treyni-san.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama, please allow me to take this mission no matter what&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Treyni, what a stubborn child!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris also looks delighted with her eyes soaking in tears.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It can&rsquo;t be helped then, I&rsquo;ll choose her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Fine. Then we will go on with Treyni-san&rsquo;s aid.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I announce so, agreeing to the participation of Treyni-san.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, the members participating the Walpurgis Banquet are settled.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My companions are Shion and Ranga.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">While Ramiris&rsquo; companions are Beretta and Treyni-san.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And our trump card is summoning Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s my luck that the Demon Lords have approved my participation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I may even meet Leon Cromwell, one of the Demon Lord whom I have grudges against.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, this time I&rsquo;ll first be checking out just what kind of a person he really is.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I still carry and am unable to deal with Shizu-san&rsquo;s dying wish and I cannot just leave it like that, but this time my target is Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The riot caused by Orc Lord is still fresh in my memory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As well as the ordeal with Myuran.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most importantly, I am worried about MIlim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we aren&rsquo;t careful, we would end up fighting Milim. I&rsquo;ve long made up my mind to take a final stand against Clayman, but if it&rsquo;s Milim, there is no way we can win&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I must utilize the opportunity well and have Clayman duel me. It would be even better if I can take care of him through the Walpurgis Banquet directly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If things don&rsquo;t go as planned, we will see about it later.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman, you&rsquo;ve treated me like an enemy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">I am no kind-hearted soul to let people who antagonize me to walk free. If you wish to kill, you must also be prepared to die.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;(D: Rimuru and Naofumi sure watches the same stuff)</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You dared to harm my companions, and I&rsquo;ll have you pay the same price.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah&mdash;&mdash;I feel like I&rsquo;ve been infected by Shion&rsquo;s impulsiveness.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I let out a sigh because of that, but there is also a sense of joy that I feel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am finally freed from all the annoyances and am able to go and face my responsibilities head on.</span></p>

		<p class="c11 c10"><span class="c15 c4">Night before the battle</span></p>
		<hr>
		<p class="c11 c10 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman was the one who initiated the Walpurgis Banquet, but it was surprisingly simple why the rest of the Demon Lords accepted it .</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mainly because he&rsquo;d found the most justified reason: &#12300;The betrayal of the Demon Lord Karion&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His crime was the violation of the non-aggression pact within the Great Jura Forest, Karion was then trialled and executed by Demon Lord Milim&mdash;&mdash;At least, that&rsquo;s what he explained to the other Demon Lords</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it was obvious that those were just excuses, the rest of the Demon Lords did not object. Perhaps they had all planned to clarify the matter during the Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But by that time, the dust will already be settled.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman has already planned everything.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He intends to buy some time before the Walpurgis Banquet to awaken as a &#12300;True Demon Lord&#12301; and receive its immense power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now Milim is in his hand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the rest of the Demon Lords see him controlling Milim, they won&rsquo;t dare to say a thing about Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s how he sees it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why failure is not an outcome in this operation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He needs to finish it quickly before the other Demon Lords decide to intervene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman has also prepared another argument, just in case.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is to expose the cause of this military operation overall&mdash;&mdash;that is, the violation of the pact by Demon Lord Karion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has taken actions to collect evidence to support his case.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With all of these preparations, Clayman decides to play his cards.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He will send the army out through Milim&rsquo;s domain to invade Beast Kingdom Yuurazania.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The role of commanding officer is given to Clayman&rsquo;s loyal servant Yamza.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He knows of Clayman&rsquo;s true intent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To achieve the goal of slaying more than ten thousand souls before the Walpurgis Banquet. For that cause Yamza marches with thirty thousand Majins under his command.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Heh, what an annoying bunch. What did they mean by &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cooperate&rdquo;? Don&rsquo;t underestimate us!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A bold, strong man shouts angrily.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">This is the city for people who worship the dragon</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c0">. This man is the high priest of the temple in the city.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His name is Midley. He is the leader of those who worship Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But Midley-sama, if we don&rsquo;t follow orders now, we&rsquo;ll really suffer . Didn&rsquo;t that commander named Yamza had a written order from Milim-sama herself?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">A servant hissing with a smile says to him.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt38" id="cmnt_ref38">[al]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His name is Hermes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is the close servant and assistant to high priest Midley, being a member of the priest group.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s always rather carefree and casual, so he may get easily categorized as the pretentious type of person.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley shouts out furiously in response, seemingly pissed off by Hermes&rsquo; attitude.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shut up Hermes. I don&rsquo;t need you to tell me what I already know too well!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes, being scolded harshly and seeing Midley so worked up, feels internally rather helpless in return.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That being said, he can relate to why Midley has become so enraged.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason is that the Majin group that was loitering within their borders since yesterday suddenly invaded this place&mdash;&mdash;The Lost City of Dragon, and somehow built a camp here as if it is their own home.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They appear to be working for Demon Lord Clayman, and are marching towards Demon Lord Karion&rsquo;s territory to investigate his violation of the pact.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They couldn&rsquo;t have said no, even if they wanted to.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though Midley is still furious, they genuinely can&rsquo;t do anything about their situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there is also a reason for that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It also happens that the person who decimated the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania of Demon Lord Karion is also the one they worship, Demon Lord Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since it&rsquo;s related to their master, naturally they had to facilitate the gathering of evidence by Clayman&rsquo;s men. Or rather, if they couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence, it would only cause disadvantages for Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Milim probably won&rsquo;t give a damn about it. It has however caused a big headache for people such as Hermes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;For real though, Milim-sama sure is troubling&hellip;&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Her stubbornness is truly something else. They deeply hope that Milim-sama can change a bit&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c4 c8">even if it&rsquo;s really just a little</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;to at least think for them. Hermes thinks to himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That would be most disrespectful, Hermes! You cannot doubt Milim-sama&rsquo;s actions.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, you are right but&hellip;&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">It&rsquo;s all because you spoiled her so much that I&rsquo;m getting more and more work every day.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hermes thinks to himself. But he can&rsquo;t say that since it will only enrage Midley more.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">But we are in some serious trouble this time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He complains to himself and starts recalling the suffering they have been through.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though they are aware that the army would be requesting to pass through the land, their attitudes are decidedly arrogant in a way that really leaves a bad taste in the residents&rsquo; mouths.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The army didn&rsquo;t pay any recognition to the Worshipers of Dragon at all and simply felt that their assistance is only natural at the time. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their request is no different from orders.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The City of Lost Dragon where the Worshipers of Dragon reside has a population of less than a hundred thousand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It does not contain any functions of a nation. The citizens help each other out and live together.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were able to live peacefully under the protection of Demon Lord Milim without much military power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At least that&rsquo;s what those who are aware of this country usually think.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this understanding is only 50% correct.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, they don&rsquo;t possess much political clout.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be specific, everyone contributes their earnings to the central temple for the high priest to redistribute equally. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Normally, one would think there will be lazy people that will undermine the system, but in reality it&rsquo;s different. The hard-working and the lazy get basic financial compensation. But apart from that, the hard-working people get to enjoy an additional bonus.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we compare it to modern-day Japan, it will be the system where everyone has the basic welfare to ensure one&rsquo;s living.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The issue with this system lies mainly on those who decide on the amount of compensation the people are given. However&hellip;. Milim has allowed Midley to handle everything in the area.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is why he holds such authority that may even determine life or death. However, Midley has never abused it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason for this is also simple: the assistant priest of Midley has the rights to abolish him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he ever becomes tyrannical and exploits his authority for his own desires, he will lose all of his status. Midley knows this very well and thats why he never became a tyrant.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But in truth, MIlim has already taken the seat of a legitimate tyrant, so no one dares to imitate her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Due to the reasons above , the thousands of worshippers are surprisingly united.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides that, there is another reason.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The belief held by the outside world that these people lack combat abilities&hellip;&hellip; is a complete misunderstanding.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">For some reason, the worshippers of Dragon are all individually equipped with strong physical capabilities.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from their unity and discipline, an adult worshipper&rsquo;s power is close to Rank C.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fact that they are all pacifistic is not nearly as remarkable when acknowledging that they are, in fact, a difficult organization to handle that favours martial strength. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The priests possess even greater power than the rest. The evidence is that there&rsquo;s only around a hundred party members.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every member is an elite and a force to be reckoned with. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyday they pray to Milim&mdash;&mdash;in forms of combat training&mdash;&mdash;As a result, their combat capabilities are extraordinary.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Among them, Midley and Hermes can even request Milim as their sparring partner&mdash;&mdash; that is how strong they both are. But even so, Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates still looked down to them all, which genuinely pissed them off.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, there&rsquo;s a bigger secret that they&rsquo;ve kept.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Which is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The day after that,</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates took the worshippers&rsquo; food from their warehouse without permission.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley&rsquo;s face is gradually bursting with his veins due to his anger, but he endured.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;By the way, why hasn&rsquo;t Milim-sama returned?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley asks, mainly in order to distract himself from his fury. .</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Only god would know, but why did you ask&mdash;&mdash;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes makes a random response. They&rsquo;ve repeated this Q&amp;A over a dozen times and the longer it goes, the more annoyed Hermes feels.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We&rsquo;ve prepared a great feast just for her&hellip;&hellip;. Could Milim-sama be suffering of hunger at some place? &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;N-No way.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes asserts.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s quite certain about the. Since the &ldquo;great feast&rdquo; Midley refers to is a large vegetable dish named &#12300;The Platter of Nature&rsquo;s Gifts&#12301;. It&rsquo;s raw by the way. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes secretly observed Milim&rsquo;s expression when he&rsquo;d dined with her when eating it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had no expression on her face, nor any emotional response. All she did was chewing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 563.00px; height: 810.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image19.png" style="width: 563.00px; height: 810.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">No way was that a great feast. She didn&rsquo;t appear to enjoy it one bit; or rather she looked as if she was trying her hardest to endure.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes is certain of it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When they&rsquo;d served the roast meat, Milim had looked quite happy eating it, that was rather obvious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then when Hermes proposed this to Midley &#12300;We should serve her cooked meal before the vegetables. Milim-sama would be very happy to have it!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He got turned down with his suggestion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley believes the direct ingestion of the rich products of nature would be the best serving&mdash;&mdash;And so, Hermes was unable to change Midley&rsquo;s mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">This is why Milim-sama seldomly comes here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes really wants to speak his mind, but he&rsquo;s in a disadvantageous position right now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has travelled through different countries and experienced delicious cuisines. In comparison, no other priests have had this kind of experience. Everyone believes the best food is always the natural ones. They will reject his proposal so long as they maintain this mindset. That&rsquo;s why Hermes decided to give up on this matter.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so? That would be good then. But how dare that Clayman act all presumptuous and force MIlim-sama to write an order&hellip;... &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The handwriting is terrible&mdash;&mdash;Correction, the handwriting on the order is uniquely intriguing, it&rsquo;s definitely Milim&rsquo;s writing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re forced to follow the order. But still, there&rsquo;s a bottom line.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, we had to comply because of Milim-sama&rsquo;s order&hellip;&hellip;.but now the third granary has also been emptied. That leaves seven left, we are gonna have a hard time until the next harvest&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Damnit!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley&rsquo;s veins bursts on his bald head like a hami melon. You can tell with one look just how much fury he holds.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes, who happens across this scene, finds it quite funny. He can only note that Midley is somewhat mentally unstable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in that instant, the source of their anger enters their sights&mdash;&mdash;Clayman army&rsquo;s commander walking towards them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;*Smacks lips* ! Hermes, we need to endure for now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Understood.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s my line&mdash;&mdash;Hermes thinks as he answers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He hopes that guy will just pass them by, but unfortunately the man makes a beeline towards Hermes and the rest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both of them stop talking to wait for the man&mdash;&mdash;Yamza, to approach them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza is the commanding officer of Clayman&rsquo;s army and it wouldn&rsquo;t be a lie to say that he is Clayman&rsquo;s right hand man.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looks rather light for his medium build, and is the type of fighter who focuses on speed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or rather, a swordsman. He is a top swordsman with swiftness beyond the wind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is equipped with the specially crafted Magic Frost Sword, gifted by Clayman. It can cast the elemental-based magic &#12300;Great Storm of Ice and Water&#12301;without chanting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The Magic Swordsman of Frost, Yamza&mdash;&mdash;The A+ Majin who wields </span><span class="c4">both</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sword and magic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehe, how are you, Midley-dono? Thank you for your support with rations; it really helped a lot. After all, I have thirty-thousand people to take care of here. No small amount of food could suffice.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza hangs a caring smile, yet such joyful expression is absent in his eyes. Instead, they are observing Midley&rsquo;s reaction carefully.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t even bother to acknowledge Hermes&rsquo; presence with a glance. This is the usual attitudes for Majins who look down on human.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This truly makes him feel uncomfortable. But, Hermes has to endure under Midley&rsquo;s order. There is no pointing arguing with Yamza anyway, so he will endure for now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ha-ha-ha. What an honor for us to assist you. However, we really aren&rsquo;t able to continue this favor. If our people are to suffer famine, MIlim-sama would be very sad.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What nonsense is this! That Demon Lord Milim acted on her and now my army has to clean up her mess. Besides, isn&rsquo;t it only natural for you to maintain the friendship between our masters?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza became furious with just two lines of response from Midley. No, his anger is an act. He&rsquo;s trying to see Midley&rsquo;s response to his pretended fury.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Midley is to lose his temper and argues back, Yamza would exploit this matter and burn down the city. It is quite obvious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah ah, my apology. I accidentally had some selfish thoughts. We&rsquo;ll help you with everything we&rsquo;ve got, so please don&rsquo;t be generous with us and speak up your mind.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to quench Yamza&rsquo;s anger, Midley bows his body and bow to him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes feels immense respect towards Midley having witnessed this. After all, Yamza has already revealed his true intent yet Midley did not even show a sign of anger on his face.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He simply smiled and replied.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Impressive, sasuga Midley-sama. Now his head doesn&rsquo;t look like a homi melon at all. If it&rsquo;s me I&rsquo;d lose my temper already.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes thinks to himself, but then&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so? But I was expecting that. But since there is no issue for us to wipe out the Beast Kingdom alone, we want to gift you with the opportunity to assist us. Would it pose any problem if you are to handle the transportation of our resources?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza gives off a evil smirk after finishing his words and caused Hermes to argue back unconsciously. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;W-wait a second! It&rsquo;s enough that you rob our food, now you want to take out labor as well&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t intend to resist. He simply slipped his thought out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Immediately after, Hermes feels tremendous pain flowing from his left hand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;AHHHHH!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shut your mouth, human trash!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza squeezes his eyes ruthlessly. His cold eyes meet with Hermes&rsquo; for the first time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes bites his teeth hard and stares back at Yamza while holding onto his severed hand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Ho, aren&rsquo;t you the rebel? Looks like you are begging me to finish you off.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza gives off a cruel smile and points his blood-stained sword towards Hermes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">You bastard, don&rsquo;t get ahead of yourself&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes wants to shout with fury, yet he was hit by a strong impact force as if he&rsquo;s been crashed by a beast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was from a kick.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley initiated a powerful kick against Hermes&rsquo; abdomen.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Haha, we are truly sorry for the continuous offense, Yamza-sama. I&rsquo;ll scold this idiot myself and educate him better in the future. Please forgive him for my sake.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley bows and pleads towards Yamza.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh. It&rsquo;s so hard to look after moronic subordinates. I&rsquo;ll let you off the hook this time. We are setting off tomorrow morning. All of you priest should go and prepare yourselves!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thanks to Midley&rsquo;s intervention was the situation salvaged and Yamza sheathed his sword. However, it came at a heavy price. The leaders that are the priest of the Worshippers of Dragons has been forced into conscription. &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza left with the line and walked away without a care.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They weren&rsquo;t planning to conscript the worshippers to war, but only the priests who are capable of restoration magic. And because Hermes couldn&#39;t restrain himself, it went the way Yamza wanted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Yamza left, Midley begins to heal Hermes while sighing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You idiot, didn&rsquo;t I just tell you to stay quiet?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t help myself and&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes holds tight onto his severed hand as Midley applies treatment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">WIth the effect of holy magic &#12300;Healing Sickness&#12301;, Hermes&rsquo; hand is restored to its original shape. But he&rsquo;s not feeling quite well after losing too much blood. But since Hermes would later apply &#12300;Stamina Regeneration&#12301;on himself, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s alright. At least the people won&rsquo;t have to suffer for now at the cost of the Priest group. Speaking of which, that man&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The suppressed anger of his now write all over Midley&rsquo;s face as he stares viciously towards the direction Yamza left.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;he dares to harm the properties of Milim-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s talking about Yamza cutting off Hermes&rsquo; hand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley expresses his anger towards such unforgivable violent acts, yet he&rsquo;s acting oblivious towards kicking Hermes just now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Hold on a second, your iron kick was quite deadly too&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But all in all, Hermes knew Midley didn&rsquo;t mean any harm so he won&rsquo;t complain about it. After all, Midley is Milim&rsquo;s follower, he&rsquo;s just as simple-minded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, not only Midley, it&rsquo;s what the entire nation is like&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh, that&rsquo;s right, can I kill him?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Idiot, you are no match for him.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The proposal is instantly rejected, but Midley has a point.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Midley just said, Hermes has no chance against Yamza.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You&rsquo;re right I suppose. That sword is rather difficult to deal with, and the man seems to have concealed other secrets as well.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, no wonder that asshole is Clayman&rsquo;s right hand man. He won&rsquo;t show his strength if not required. But a man should fight justly&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, that sounds really stupid you know&mdash;&mdash;Hermes thinks to himself. But his thought is not mainstream in this country at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is forced to agree, then returned to finish his work. The sudden change of plan to set off tomorrow leaves a lot of business to pile up for him to deal with.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The morning of the other day soon follows&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Walpurgis Banquet will be held two days later, Clayman&rsquo;s army is again, commencing its invasion operation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The meeting is over and it&rsquo;s the next day&rsquo;s morning.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t get much sleep last night, so I&rsquo;m feeling the drowsiness. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;s just mental tiredness, I&rsquo;m in fact more lively as ever.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t have to sleep, which makes things convenient for me during time like this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei contacted me after yesterday&rsquo;s meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His real self came for the meeting but his clones made from &#12300;Shadow Clone&#12301; have been travelling in the border of the Beast Kingdom to help him collect intels.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei&rsquo;s five subordinates including Souka have been quite active as well, helping us collecting many intelligences.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman&rsquo;s army that we&rsquo;ve been on guard against has not made a move yet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve been looking for appropriate locations to deploy our ary. A question arose however.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Beast Kingdom residents seeking refuge have been spread across the place. In order to rescue them, we seem to run short on time whichever direction we decide to march towards. The attacking route taken by Clayman has put us in disadvantage.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;There is a solution. Transport the refugees to a specific location altogether. This would improve the efficiency.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, I see.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm, indeed it&rsquo;s right.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is not as if the army is the only viable subjects of teleportation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could utilize &#12300;Dimension Domination&#12301;to teleport wherever I want, so I can instantly teleport towards the locations of Souei&rsquo;s clones, Souka and the rest. There I can open a new &#12300;Teleportation&#12301;to transport and gather the refugees to a specific location.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s how it is, now I&rsquo;ve got more work to do after the meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I need to send Geld&rsquo;s troop first to build up camp for the refugees.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The destination of the teleportation is the capital of Beast Kingdom, which has been wiped out by Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The location has become a wide plain of wasteland which makes it extra eye-catching. However, it&rsquo;s perfectly suitable to accommodate a huge army. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After I&rsquo;ve inspected the gatherings and transport the refugees.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve finished transporting everyone last night, which is why I&rsquo;m worn out at the moment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;With that being said, it&rsquo;s still just tiredness in the mental level.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luckily I had Phobio by my side so the refugees weren&rsquo;t resisting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Phobio was worn out by it as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon departing he even said: &#12300;Why do you seem so carefree with all these continuous teleportations&hellip;&hellip;? And these type of massive scale teleportation magic&hellip;.. This is just too much&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;and he looked at me like some sort of monster, what a rude guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course I am tired as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this way, Geld has built the marching tents for the war. The exhausted Phobio is now resting in one of them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, yeah, Phobio is not the point of discussion here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our army needs to get prepared as well. I&rsquo;ve got to send them off with glory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I move to the plaza that has yet to be completed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was prepared by Rigurdo overnight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he worked all night like me, he&rsquo;s still running around with livelihood.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I should call Rigurdo back and let him go assist Geld.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And speaking of work, I still have to send the people here to the camp at Beast Kingdom.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When all of these are settled, I&rsquo;ll need to think through the details in preparations for the Walpurgis Banquet the day after tomorrow. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After arriving at the plaza, I see the soldiers have been waiting there already in order.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are the ten-thousand Beastmen army led by the Beastketeers&mdash;&mdash;Suphia and Alvis. The units don&rsquo;t really have standard issued equipments, but it can&rsquo;t really be helped. Since their equipments are spares ones from us that have been abandoned due to their repair.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And most of the beastmen are also capable of &#12300;Beastilization&#12301;, so it is much more convenient than having them wear a full set of armor.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My subordinates are listed along with them to travel as reinforcement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As compared to our battle against Charybdis, their scale and combat abilities have all increased greatly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru discovered that I&rsquo;ve arrived and came standing next to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems he has caught the chance to explain to me about everyone&rsquo;s evolution condition.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Following my evolution, everyone also experienced changes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Voice Of the world&#12301;mentioned that it will gift blessings to </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c4">s with connections to my soul and those </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s that are named by me seem to fall under that category.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to the survey around the town, they seem to have experienced significant changes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here is what Benimaru said:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;After the survey with the town folks we got the following results, the male constituents have gained more stamina and strength while the female constituents&rsquo; skins became smoother, plus their appearance become more beautiful. I don&rsquo;t really care about that point&mdash;&mdash;no actually, this may sound pretty weird but their vitality seems to have increased&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru was able to update me on the condition of the residents as everyone else is moving in formation. Some people seem to have transform younger in appearance. Everyone is very grateful about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they are all non-combatants. So they only need to watch over the town this time instead of the joining the march.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, let&rsquo;s talk about the main combat forces.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some combatants have gained skills, and since every corp has their unique features, the skills they gained seem range all over the place as they were assigned them based on the features of their combat unit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m really looking forward to seeing them in action.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now let&rsquo;s check on the veteran forces.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Goblin riders unit is under the leadership of Captain Gobuta.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are Hobgoblins who ride the star wolf race which requires a certain set of conditions to trigger the evolution.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are they really Hobgoblins?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their race is indeed Hobgoblin, but their nature doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit under the race.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These guys seemed to have gained a rare skill, Extra Skill &#12300;Unification&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This skill is not just a simple metaphor for the rider and its ride, but it&rsquo;s in fact a real merger skill. In order words, once the skill &#12300;Unification&#12301;is activated, they would become powerful fighter that runs at high speed on four legs. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their combined strength after unification is approximately Rank A.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The ability is specialized in battling a single enemy, that&rsquo;s why </span><span class="c4">its</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;combat rank does not reach Rank A. But with that being said, its combat ability is still outstanding. If several groups of its users fight together, they may stand a chance against a Rank A majin.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the goblin riders are good at teamwork.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are most reliable in high speed communication and on top of that, have endured much harsh training. After all, they&rsquo;ve been personally trained (fucked) by Hakurou.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One can imagine the horrifying sight of such a corp being mobilized in group of hundreds.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are likely very different from the combat rank assigned by the humans, so I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to the performance of these fighters.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And up next are Benimaru&rsquo;s subordinates.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Since I&rsquo;ve become the leader of Jura Forest, the combat capabilities of these </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s have increased drastically.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Especially the Ogre race that have around three hundred personals. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ones with impressive fighting capabilities among them are all young lads who were born from the village that sought help from me initially. They seem to have been blessed with evolution due to their admiration for Benimaru and the others.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s really quite surprising.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of them joined in voluntarily, among them joined as named fighter already. Their strength can rival that of Lower Majin, which make them quite reliable fighters.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The wild, unintelligent ogre has already reached Rank B before they joined. And now they are all equipped well and have learnt skills.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No way they aren&rsquo;t strong.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">These people formed Benimaru&rsquo;s personal bodyguards, named &#12300;Kurenai&#12301;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a combat group with individual strength up to Rank A-.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now let&rsquo;s see the constituents of the vanguards led by Benimaru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are roughly four thousands hobgoblins who have all undergone intriguing evolution.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve gained &#12300;Flame Control&#12301;and &#12300;Heat Change Resistance&#12301;, therefore turning into elemental fire.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A rather surprising change.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their individual rank is B, the same as the special attack force that focuses on strong attack power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And since all of these hobgoblins have green skins, all of their names are related to green.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone to name them with these names, I really hope he&rsquo;d had a better vision for the future.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer. Master was the one who named them.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I know already! </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t believe someone would tease me. So annoying!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s really because I didn&rsquo;t think that much in the past.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The evolution of </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is truly amazing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And since the members are all named after the colour green, the corp&rsquo;s name is also named the Green Corps.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Life is all about being simplistic~</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since it was Benimaru&rsquo;s subordinates, I wanted to use red as their but green is profound in its own way. The members all have fire attacks unlike the color of their skins. It should create a surprise for the opponents, so it would do just fine.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I need to dye their equipments green as well and give them chances to display their strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And further down I saw Geld&rsquo;s troops that have formed two lines of wall with the Green Corps.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The orcs&rsquo; evolution also came in group.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone obtained Extra Skill &#12300;Superhuman Strength&#12301; and &#12300;Iron Wall&#12301;which serve to fortify their bodies. The captains additionally the Extra Skill &#12300;Earth Manipulation&#12301; that enables them to manipulate soil at will.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are the new skills Geld mentioned before. They seem to be very useful in the mass-production of trenches. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And everyone also gained Extra Skill &#12300;Full-Body Fortification&#12301;that makes the corp structure to focus on defense capabilities. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Furthermore, they&rsquo;ve inherited most of my resistance. Besides &#12300;Physical Attack Resistance&#12301;, they also gained &#12300;Pain/Corrosion/Electricity/Paralysis Resistance&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The complete version of the shield that I gifted to Cabal once, the Charybdis Scale Shield has been crafted to achieve special grade in terms of quality and possess defense capability against Magic. &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, they can now resist both physical and magical attacks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I also genuinely considered helping them gain poison resistance with Shion&rsquo;s cooking&hellip;. But I should probably give up that though&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sigh, if only could I get another batch of Charybdis scales. Garm has finished processing the final product so Kurobe could replicate them in large quantities. I really appreciate these professional craftsmen.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now we are able to turn them into a strong corp with individual rank reaching B. If all of its members can special grade equipments, they would easily surpass the standards of a normal army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They can be said to be an overpowered corp of defensive force. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It has five thousand members in total.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And with more and more volunteers joining, the number continues to grow.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They would handle construction projects in daily lives and turn into a strong legion if encounter any emergency.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who are capable of resisting all sorts of attack that can be said to be the legion of Iron Wall.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;The Yellow Corps, would be the official name of this legion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behind them are the some hundred dragonoids led by Gabiru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Dragonoids already possesses very high racial attributes. And it is natural that they are up to Rank A.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With my blessings, the blood of dragon has been awakened more thoroughly. They&rsquo;ve gained the intrinsic skill of &#12300;Dragon Warrior Conversion&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They also get to choose either &#12300;Black Flame Fog&#12301;or &#12300;Black Lightning Fog&#12301;, and thus gained an additional range attack ability.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabiru is able to use both skills, very impressive!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so I&rsquo;m only not sure about what &#12300;Dragon Warrior Conversion&#12301;is.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer. Intrinsic Skill &#12300;Dragon Warrior Conversion&#12301;is&mdash;&mdash;&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, no need to explain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I already know I can&rsquo;t use that skill, so there&rsquo;s no use hearing the explanation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I just hope that they would be able to use this skill well. But I trust Gabiru and the rest would work hard on their own to figure out the skills themselves. There&rsquo;s no point in gaining power without hardwork. Or at least that&rsquo;s how I see it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eh, so what about me?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have the ultimate skill &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301;. I&rsquo;ll be fine against any challenge with the aid of Raphael.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raphael is my power, so in some sense, it is the equivalent of me working very hard. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable to say I&rsquo;ve not slacked one bit in terms of effort.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that would be it. I hope Gabiru-kun and his partners could learn to use that skill well before the next crisis strike! Even though it&rsquo;s a bit irresponsible on my part, I still hope they would work hard on it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just saying, but what a waste it is for these subordinates to serve Gabiru..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are all able to fly, making their fog attack from the sky hard to defend against.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their racial attributes granted tham many innate resistances.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were born with hardened scale that&rsquo;s hard as steel and equips chest piece crafted with magical steel. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Weaker attack, whether with sword or magic won&rsquo;t be able to pierce through it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They have an overwhelming advantage already given their flying capability and now they also get the body of defense.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are the assault squad possessing the trinity of speed, attack and defense. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">So I&rsquo;ve officially named them &#12300;Hiryuu&#12301;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They only have around hundred members, yet they are the strongest troop in our nation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ones standing in the last row are the newly appointed troops.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These troops are my personal bodyguards.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the one leading them is Shion. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Structurally, it consists around a hundred members who were all previously resurrected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of them used to be children and they were able to age quickly to their adolescence. There&rsquo;s no doubt that their regrets of not being able to fight back during the riot has prompted them to evolve&hellip;&hellip; They gained the following skills, Extra Skill &#12300;Perfect Memory&#12301; and &#12300;Automatic Regeneration&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two skills accommodate each other well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since they have &#12300;Perfect Memory&#12301;, even if their head gets blown off, their memory would still remain intact in their astral body. And as long as they activate &#12300;Automatic Regeneration&#12301;during this period, they would be able to save themselves with the possibility of getting revived.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be honest, they&rsquo;ve gained the impressive regenerative ability that was also displayed by the Orc Disaster.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now if they somehow evolved &#12300;Automatic Regeneration&#12301; to &#12300;Super Regeneration&#12301;, they would almost have an unkillable body.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are in total a hundred of them. But it&rsquo;s honestly rather repulsive.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from that, they&rsquo;ve become quite arrogant having obtained fierce speed of regeneration, and are able to survive Shion&rsquo;s hellish special training at ease.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, someone even said &#12300;What&rsquo;s to worry about it since we won&rsquo;t die!&#12301;. it came from a little girl who was just a kid recently&hellip;.. I&rsquo;m really speechless towards that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m not sure if I should scold her or encourage her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now they are only around Rank C, but I have a feeling that they would become the strongest unit in our nation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The troops&rsquo; name is &#12300;Shikokushu&#12301;&#65288;Yomigaeri &#34311;&#12426;&#65289;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shikoku&rdquo; has the meaning of overcoming death, it will be a good match to them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that&rsquo;s about it, the above is all of the report.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the changes brought by my evolution as well as their own efforts afterward, they have achieved fruitful results and made a magnificent display of their strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first I thought they&rsquo;ve only gained some combat capabilities.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet now this army with less than ten thousand soldiers can easily take down those standard army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are greatly outnumbered by the Falmas army I eliminated, yet their abilities are far above them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ehh, what a surprising result from the report.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their only weakness is their small number, I&rsquo;d have to slowly increase after assessing our national power carefully. But ten thousand should be sufficient for a standing army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, there are still reserved forces in the town that are responsible for defense.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a troop assembled by the residents of the Jura Great Forest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The difference is still too large, so I didn&rsquo;t allow them to join in the battle. But it&rsquo;s possible to turn them into a combat force after more trainings in the future.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That matter would have to wait for another day.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This concludes the report brought by Benimaru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, it&rsquo;s quite a majestic sight when all ten thousand subordinates are lined up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are also ten thousand Beastmen warriors.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two armies with a total of twenty thousand personnel quietly await their moment to march.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&rsquo;s &#12300;Shikokushu&#12301;are acting now as my personal bodyguards, so I&rsquo;ve told to stay out of the army for now. Instead they would be watching over their base this time, so it would only lead to nuisances if they line up along the rest. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama, everything is ready.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rigurdo arrives and reports to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I really need to thank him for ordering all these without rest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Rigurdo would respond&#12300;That&rsquo;s too kind of you&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;and gives a satisfied smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alright, the preparation is done. It&rsquo;s time for some &#12300;Teleportation&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, Alvis-san&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You can call me Alvis, Rimuru-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis responded to me like that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I was hoping to act more politely, but it did the opposite effect and caused her to panic. I suppose I would be more straight-forward then.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I see, Alvis. We&rsquo;ve gathered all of your companions in the other side, please inform them of the results of our meeting. I&rsquo;d bet Phobio is formating the troops there, so I&rsquo;ll leave the rest to you!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Understood. We will never forget your kindness.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis bows deeply to me, followed by Suphia as well as the rest of the Beastmen.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got the sudden pressure of having forced others into submission. But I endured my feelings, after all, these are gestures of their gratitudes. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama has helped us so much. Now we can be relieved of our concerns and beat the crap out of Clayman&rsquo;s people. Please allow us to resolve your grievances with Clayman in your place!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia says so and laughs.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What a beauty indeed, but her expression is quite scary.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis seems to agree to her along those words and also shows a scary expression with killing aura all over the place. The two seem to be saying that they are all hyped up for the havoc they are going to cause.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are twenty thousand Beastmen in total, perhaps they don&rsquo;t really need reinforcement&hellip; Actually, the more the people the better.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we consider their army alone, they would still lose to Clayman&rsquo;s army in terms of number.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the addition of my reinforcement, the united army reaches thirty thousand men like Clayan&rsquo;s army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have the same number of soldiers and the advantage of higher quality of soldiers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problem is however&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right Benimaru, is there any problem with the attack plan?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve run around for the entire yesterday to gather all the Beastmen and had Benimaru showed them the attack plan again.There were no major changes, but if I take out the part concerning the refugee groups that were distracting the enemies, some modifications to the details must be made.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, there is no problem. Since Clayman&rsquo;s target is the citizens of the Beast Kingdom, active retreats would definitely be effective, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru responds so with a smile that bears cunningness.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm, I also think it&rsquo;s a good method. There is no need for them to clash head on and results in casualty.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes. I&rsquo;ve discussed with Benimaru-san. Right now we still have time to switch battlefield, so we may commence our attack later&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Alvis follows through as well while playing her golden khakkhara</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and begins to discuss the attack plan delightfully.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything seems alright.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Clayman couldn&rsquo;t get what he wanted before the Walpurgis Banquet, he would definitely take it out on his subordinate.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if the commander gets desperate and begins to act recklessly in fear of Clayman&rsquo;s fury, we would really gain more advantage through it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;The troops would be allocated near the entrance of Jura Great Forest. That wasteland was once my hometown. Today it is the site of the fallen orc kingdom Obic, where my breatherens are buried.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld says so almost with a hidden sentiment of hatred.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That kingdom was destroyed due to Clayman&rsquo;s conspiracy, and now it will be the location of the final battle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The writing was on the wall all these times, could this be karma in work?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The attack plan is very simple.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We will have the refugees pretending to escape into the Jura Great Forest and have our forces confront the pursuing enemies face-on.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; has assisted me to perfectly simulate the battle scenario in my head. With the input of the informations and descriptions given by Souei&rsquo;s party, I am able to create a sketch, that is very similar to the reality, of the blueprints of future events.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And through my &#12300;Telepathy Net&#12301;, I was able to transfer this information to everyone for their convenience in grasping the situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We initially planned to bait the enemies while protecting the refugees to retreat, and then surround and eliminate them. And with the modification of the plan, the faster moving crowds will now act as baits. This has lowered the risks of individual party getting defeated. It is natural then that it will significantly increases the chances of success of the plan. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The key is to lure the enemies deep into the forest to eliminate.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wasn&rsquo;t planning to kill them all, but to let some escape. But it would be troublesome if they regroup and fight back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I suppose I&rsquo;ll do this one through and through.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Benimaru, you know what to do, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Of course. I&rsquo;ll show them living hell so they&rsquo;ll never dare to have the thought of opposing us.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru answers with a delightful smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, that is the expression of no mercy for enemies.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Kill them all, Benimaru!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Kufufufufu. If you don&rsquo;t take out the trash early, it may stink in the future.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion and Diablo encourages Benimaru loud.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Encouragement&mdash;&mdash;The word seems mildly inappropriate here, but I digress.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those two also want to join the battle. They sure are war fanatic, but unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not happening this time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion would stay along my side to prepare for the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo would set out later to conquer Falmas.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is why they won&rsquo;t be able to take part in this battle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll leave the rest to Benimaru and wait for the good news.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright, report to me immediately if anything happens. I&rsquo;ll send you guys in now, you must achieve victory!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;YES SIR&mdash;&mdash;! WE SHALL ACHIEVE VICTORY FOR YOU!&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Several lines of sights were laid on me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I glance through the crowds with my golden eyes and initiated the magic circle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve practiced this several times last night and grown quite familiar with it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A giant magic circle appears on the ground where the twenty-thousand men army stands and it begins to stack from bottom to top.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are several layers of geometric patterns within the square that appeared, I can understand none of it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It truly causes a lot of magicules and concentration trying to teleport twenty thousand men at the same time. My magicules are depleting gradually, but it seems sufficient when I count it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But with that being said, I&rsquo;ve stored up too much magicules.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Around five minutes passed since.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone has been standing still for the teleportation magic circle to be completed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Afterward, as the square travels above everyone&rsquo;s head, in an instant&mdash;&mdash;A blinding bright light appears and the army disappears entirely.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The teleportation has ended. It seems I&rsquo;ve successfully sent everyone away.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, I got super scared initiating this for the first time last night.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, it shone such a bright light at midnight. It got me all spooked worrying it might have been spotted by Clayman&rsquo;s army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After which I used smoke screening magic to cover up the light of the magic circle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything has a chance to fail, so I should never get careless.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time there is no need to hide the light, so I get to witness the spectacle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Sasuga Rimuru-sama, what a beautiful spell!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed, its sight alone had me mesmerized!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo begins to praise me with Shion, unwilling to miss out, starting to flatter me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo seems to like magic a lot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps we will discuss more about magic after the dust is settled with the issue at hand. He may know some magic I&rsquo;ve never heard of.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Shion, I need to be careful about her getting jealous of people around me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It will be really troublesome if she tries to mess with others.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think so while nodding to the two, then proceed to leave the location.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After everyone has left, Veldora who seems to be bored come strolling to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After which he starts to make some idiot talks. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru, why don&rsquo;t you let me go beat the crap out of them?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course this guy didn&rsquo;t hear a thing I said.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you already! You need to keep your thing a secret before the Walpurgis Banquet! If you go on a rampage there, you will be exposing us right there!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;GA&mdash;&mdash;HAHA, oh yeah, there&rsquo;s that. I happened to forget about it.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&rsquo;d better be!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mister Give me headache.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Would it work if I give him a bunch of more mangas beforehand?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m still concerned that he may mess something up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I gotta find someone to keep an eye on him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Later this noon, Youmu and his party also went on their journey.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve told them to chat a lot about the resurrection of Veldora on their way to Falmas. And also have them spread the news in all the villages to let the rumor spread out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason behind is very obvious, to let Clayman get hold of it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I really hope this news reach him soon, I thought so as I sent them out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo told me: &#12300;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll be right back.&#12301;How low are you looking down on Falmas Kingdom? That actually caused me to worry about him. But I&rsquo;ll leave it to him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone would encounter failure at some point, it won&rsquo;t be late to consider things when it happens.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that, Gazel also returned to Dwargon. His ministers seem to have be furious so he went back in panic&hellip;&hellip;Something must have gone wrong with his body double. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You could imagine that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I swear not to follow his footstep. So I need to plan everything perfectly</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that thought circling in my mind, I saw Gazel off.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another day passed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to the message sent by Benimaru, they were successfully teleported to their destination.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean everything would be smooth-sailing onward.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The thirty-thousand men army as well as the refugee were very restricted in terms of movement. Even if they are all strong beastmen unlike humans and the arrival time to the destination won&rsquo;t be prolonged for long, still&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No need to worry, I&rsquo;ve already planned out solutions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Just like that, I&rsquo;ve prepared the area for reception, so we can teleport the non-combatants back to the town in Tempest Federation. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I pat on Benimaru&rsquo;s shoulder as I finish my sentence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh yeah&hellip;.. You can do that&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru gives a look that says &#12300;Why didn&rsquo;t I realize that earlier&#12301; and sighs.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No no no, this type of teleportation spell would consume a lot of my magicules. And the more people there are the more magicules it costs.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t have much strength left after teleporting the twenty thousand people yesterday. I can&rsquo;t spam the spell too much, so it hasn&#39;t been a waste of time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, this spell has some brand new elements that may topple common senses. I would definitely come up with ways to actively exploit this in the battlefield. Furthermore considering that there is probably very few people who can cast this type of large scale magic, we thus will turn the table around and have the advantage.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyhow, after sending everyone off yesterday, Rigurdo has since finished preparing the location for the refugee to spend the night. So I only intend to teleport them back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s how it is, to teleport everyone back as soon as possible.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are also coping quite well. Those who are teleported back got used to it very quickly. No one showed any sign of distress, that&rsquo;s impressive.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I told Rigurdo to lead everyone here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I can continue to work on a certain something left over from yesterday.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hope I could get this done on time with the Walpurgis Banquet and pray there wouldn&rsquo;t be any emergency.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything has been smooth-sailing since and the day of Walpurgis Banquet has finally arrived.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I finished the work at hand before lunch and enter the final stage after noon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I finally got a breath as I seem to have caught up in time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru, this is&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How about it, isn&rsquo;t it amazing?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are a genius!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who are you by the way&hellip;&hellip; to put my question aside, I don&rsquo;t have time with her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I need to rest myself well for the night.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why, Ramiris, I&rsquo;m gonna ignore your silly talk.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, I finished my lunch and entered the final stage of work.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I put the finalized product in my &#12300;Stomach&#12301; and head to the Dryad residence where Treyni-san lives. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora also wanted to follow, but I told him to endure it for now. Although it&rsquo;s unlikely, I left him there in case the town goes under attack.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now, the town of Tempest Federation is under the protection of Veldora&rsquo;s &#12300;Barrier&#12301;. It can also prevent Clayman&rsquo;s eavesdrop, but it will be problematic if the barrier is removed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I told him to bring him out next time, and I, Ramiris and Treyni-san set out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feel kind of sorry for him, however, I did tell Beretta to stay with Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He definitely would be handled like a servant, so I also feel sorry for Beretta. I&rsquo;ve got to compensate him next time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like that, we activated &#12300;Dimension Manipulation&#12301; and changed location.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">As I arrive at the residence, I see the insect </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Apito and Zegion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I first rescued Apito, it was around fifty centimeters long. Now it has grown healthily to fifty centimeters. It makes me happy seeing it is able to grow up healthily.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The other one, Zegion, has grown to around seventy centimeters. It seems to have grown quite strong now that the lower </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;won&rsquo;t even dare to mess with it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">It seems that no </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;around here could beat Zegion, its strength is rather mysterious. I once told it to not be stubborn in battle, so he shouldn&rsquo;t have fought any uncertain battle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zegion is aware of his limitation unlike Gobuta or Gabiru who gets cocky everytime they improve. Zegion is a very reliable individual.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apito happily approached us after discovering me and gifted me some hone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thanks, this is an amazing medicine! Knowing so, I gotta take a bite fast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Honey is the perfect solution to smooth tiredness.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As expected of the super rare and effective medicine that would cure anything illness.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;R-Rimuru, wait up&mdash;&mdash;no, Rimuru-san? I have something to ask you&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris starts to ask me with an anxious tone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What&rsquo;s wrong?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;T-that insect, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a legion bee...right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No idea, I don&rsquo;t know.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No idea.. I mean, are you seriously&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris is greatly shocked by it, so what if it is a legion bee?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama, as that sama has mentioned, I am the highest ranked breed among the Legion Bees, the Queen Bee. If you so desire, shall I summon my subordinates?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh oh, that sounds cool. But there&rsquo;s no need for that right now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You can summon them when this residence is in danger. If you want to find your more of your companions, you can discuss that with Treyni-san and then summon.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;There is no need. Then I won&rsquo;t summon them now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apito flaps its wing and left happily with a &ldquo;Buzzzzz&rdquo; sound.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">That buzz sound sounds both beautiful and cruel, and seem to be able to cut people in half with just its sound. Could it be that the Legion Bees are some type of dangerous </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;N-no way, right? Apito has been collecting honey for me, how can it be dangerous?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides there is Zegion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zegion bows to me in silence and follows Apito away.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It really has some celebrity like style, resembling a lot to an insect king.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It may even grow stronger and evolve. I&rsquo;ll invite him to be my subordinate by that time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turn back to see Ramiris all speechless with Treyni-san comforting her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You were right, it says it&rsquo;s a Legion bee. And it seems to be a queen as well!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I try to talk to Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I heard it too! Seriously, you&hellip;&hellip;.Uhh, never mind. Your ability seems to have no bound. Speaking of that, the other one also seems&hellip;no, there&rsquo;s no way&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Etc, she begins to say some bizarre things. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s annoying trying to get in her head, plus there&rsquo;s no time, so i won&rsquo;t put this on my mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whatever Ramiris says is probably not important, probably.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ve reached our destination.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Below the core of Treyni-san&mdash;&mdash;The Giant Spirit Tree.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I take out the completed work from my &#12300;Stomach&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for what it is, it&rsquo;s actually a dark orb.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no light reflecting on it nor is there any shining from it. However, this object carries certain power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Its usage would be&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Treyni-san&mdash;&mdash;to be more accurate, Dryads, are the offspring of fairies. They are spiritual life form that gained their bodies by merging with trees. This created their physical bodies that are made up of magicule, which allows their astral body to possess and leave at will.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But no matter how they do it, their core remains within the forest, that is the Great Spirit Tree.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem that the location of Walpurgis Banquet is set in a special dimension where Treyni-san may be rejected from entering. Considering that,I decided to operate a big surgery to free her core from its restrain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike Beretta, who doesn&rsquo;t possess a body in the physical world, Treyni-san has one. That&rsquo;s why in order for her to possess onto a new body, I need to transfer the core of her current body to the new one.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a new core that is, I&rsquo;ve got that part covered.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">I am able to produce &#12300;Holy Magic Core&#12301;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;under special conditions and with the necessary ingredients. The orb I just took out is the vessel for the&#12300;Holy Magic Core&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">To explain these, it is like extracting the magicule stone from a </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and getting rid of the magicules in it. It is very hard to turn it into one without any attribute, I failed several times before success. And I spent the day before collecting the necessary ingredients for creating this vessel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to create &#12300;Holy Magic Core&#12301;, I need to balance the holy aura and monster aura within the vessel. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it&rsquo;s for Beretta, you only need to take the same amount of both before reversing their properties. But it won&rsquo;t work on Treyni-san.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why, apart from the holy aura inserted to the vessel by Treyni-san, I need to control and release the same amount of monster aura into it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Come on, &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301;. It&rsquo;s time for your operation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once it begins, Treyni-san, without hesitation, transfers her holy aura into the vessel. Meanwhile, I insert the monster aura.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a delicate operation that we are both following through.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Great Spirit Tree begins to gradually wither as it loses its life force. It is this moment that the orb starts to glow and distinguish in a cycle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is just like heart-beats.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Light and shadow interweave.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Afterward&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The orb begins to gives off a hazy green glow. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the ignition of the fire of life.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Announcement. Mixed in individual name: Treyni&rsquo;s Attributes, &#12300;Holy Magic Core&#12301;creation successful.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As predicted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We did it. From now on this orb would be Treyni-san&rsquo;s core.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Thank you, Rimuru-sama!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Thanks, Rimuru! Now we can bring Treyni along without a problem!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, we should. But, speaking of that&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now she won&rsquo;t get cut off from communicating with her core, now would she be missing when we enter a different dimension. But I still think there&rsquo;s something missing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Treyni-san, since this tree was your core, do you mind if I take it?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Of course, please use it as you wish.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I express my thanks and begin to execute the idea I just came up with.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What are you doing?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehe, just sit and watch!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I begin to cut down the woods and process it into shape.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are parts of a highly simulated humanoid doll.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ohoh, OHOHOHOH! Could it be that you want to&mdash;&mdash;!!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris has seen my process of producing Beretta and seems to have realized my intent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m utilizing the Great Spirit Tree that was affected by Treyni-san&rsquo;s magic to create a temporary body for her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like that, three hours passed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I finally finish making the doll since afternoon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve strengthened it with &#12300;Magical Steel&#12301;in the inside and polished the wood that it&rsquo;s its appearance. It is surprisingly comfortable on the hand and it&rsquo;s very much near completion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ohoh, could this be&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Treyni-san who seldom shows surprise looks rather shocked</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, isn&rsquo;t it a fine job? If you don&rsquo;t mind, you can use this as your body.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no need to ask for an answer.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris is overjoyed and started to hurry Treyni to try it on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Treyni-san is also very grateful and possesses the new body while thanking me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From that moment onward, this doll would become Treyni-san&rsquo;s core body.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that, a completely independent Dryad is born.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Once the&#12300;Holy Magic Core&#12301;, which is often compared to as the heart of </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">, is possessed onto the doll, the burst of magic begins to spread throughout the surface of the wood. What follows was the surprisingly damping of the white wood grain that makes it as smooth and polished as human skin.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, it has surpassed the human skin to become a beauty beyond the human realm.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike Beretta, whose face was made up of his skull, the wood used is carved such that its head has a simple sketch of Treyni-san&rsquo;s face. But as soon as she possesses into it, it begins to show a gente look that is resembles closely of real humans.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though it is wood carving, it is able to open its mouth and blink.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The rationales are all mysteries. The only explanation is that she is a </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps it was because the wood was once her core, the two coexists very well. Anyhow, the operation turns out to be successfully due to my flash of idea.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">For some reason, even her power was increased.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I inserted my monster aura, &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; extracted the perfect amount and formed the &#12300;Holy Magic Core&#12301; that is perfectly in sync with Treyni-san&rsquo;s holy aura. In other words, her magicule count is doubled as a result.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from obtaining both holy and monster attributes, she seems to have picked up new skills as well. Shion&rsquo;s magicule storage has always been the highest within my companions, yet her presence now feels stronger.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is definitely stronger than Orc Disaster.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it still couldn&rsquo;t reach the same level as Demon Lord Karion. They both are nonetheless, very strong in their own way.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She seems to be equal to Disaster Rank S.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s not Calamity-equivalent Special A Rank, which is what applies to a demon lord&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#12290;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rank system made by the freedom association probably couldn&rsquo;t find the equivalent of this type of special Majin. I personally think she&rsquo;s close to Demon Lord&rsquo;s level, it is probably the correct guess.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Dryad Humanoid Fairy&mdash;&mdash;A wise </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that can rival Demon Lord. Now that Treyni-san has undergone this transition, she has become a powerful Majin that follows Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raphael must also be surprised too.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer. It&rsquo;s all within my prediction.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, isn&rsquo;t it surprised!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I know, it&rsquo;s being sour for losing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;.............&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raphael has no comment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After achieving the small triumph mentally, I went to state farewell to Treyni-san&rsquo;s sisters.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Treyni-san&rsquo;s sister Trya and Delis witnessed the whole operation. They both looked quite jealous. Speaking of them, shouldn&rsquo;t I reward the hardworking moderators that&rsquo;s been watching over Jura Great Forest, running a surgery or two with them won&rsquo;t matter much&hellip;&hellip; But that would need to be on hold for now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ll discuss more when I return safely from the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they all decide to follow and server Ramiris, it would be a headache when Jura Great Forest no longer has moderators.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I return to the town having all these thoughts processed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The preparations are complete.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I raise my head unconsciously and find no trace of the moon but the beautiful stars shining across the galaxy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh yeah, tonight is the night of the new moon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under such beautiful night sky, the bell of war has rung.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this very moment&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Covered by the shining light of stars under the night sky, I walk towards my battlefield </span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>

		<hr>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demon Lord Clayman holds his glass of wine in one hand and awaits the arrival of that moment quietly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tonight is the night of Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">He looks both happy and irritated while analyzing </span><span class="c4">several intel</span><sup><a href="#cmnt39" id="cmnt_ref39">[am]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;in his mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">First, the bad news.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has ignored his friend Laplace&rsquo;s advice and ordered the attack on Beast Kingdom Yuurazania. But it turned out there wasn&rsquo;t a single citizen there, and it was a waste of his time. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He went on a raging storm after receiving &nbsp;a report from the commanding officer Yamza. But he can&rsquo;t give out order hastily without knowing the circumstances. That&rsquo;s why Clayman temporarily assembled the army to conduct a thorough search within the area.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a result, they discovered a group of escapees.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon receiving the report, Clayman decided to order a pursuit without even thinking and dispatched reconnaissance around the area to spot out the hidden survivors. &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as it turned out, several hundred residents were hiding in the area, Clayman thus ordered his generals to take care of all of them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">However,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the survivors went on escape as soon as the order is delivered.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt40" id="cmnt_ref40">[an]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman was also bewildered by this and ordered an investigation out of confusion. That was the moment he discovered that there were thousands of refugee around the area that has gathered and escaped to the Jura Forests.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The hidden survivors were distractions to facilitate the escape of the main population.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Cheeky bastards!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Until that point did Clayman realize why the residents of the Beast Kingdom were nowhere to be seen</span><sup><a href="#cmnt41" id="cmnt_ref41">[ao]</a></sup><span class="c0">. They have already mass migrated to seek refugee from Rimuru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And those escapees have noticed the movements of Clayman&rsquo;s army.Thus they&rsquo;ve released baits to help the rest to escape&mdash;&mdash;This is how Clayman analyzes the situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">His plan to hunt down some souls before the Walpurgis Banquet has now failed. This </span><span class="c4">unforeseen</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">occurrence</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;greatly displeases Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yamza, the Banquet is starting soon. Before I return, move out all of our force. Do not let anyone escape. Kill them all and bring me the survivors.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Your wish is my command!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman nods in responding to his subordinate. It has become an unarguable fact that it is too late for him to awake.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Clayman ends the magical communication; </span><span class="c4">having much anger still remained in his heart.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt42" id="cmnt_ref42">[ap]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But on the other hand, there are also good news.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Clayman can collect intelligence through the landscape</span><span class="c4">&mdash;&mdash;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt43" id="cmnt_ref43">[aq]</a></sup><span class="c0">electric signal and earth magnetism. No one knows about his talents,which is why Clayman was able to obtainan immense amount of information.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the origin of Clayman&rsquo;s title&#12300;Marionette Master&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When he first obtained this skill, he could only interfere with individuals within his line of sights. Nowadays, this power has grown because of Clayman&rsquo;s continuous efforts developing it and has become the trump card that backs him up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The power, namely the unique skill &#12300;Puppeteer&#12301;&mdash;&mdash; </span><span class="c4">allows him to transform intel into coded transmission so as to monitor within a large radius.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt44" id="cmnt_ref44">[ar]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;He is able to dispatch and </span><span class="c4">monitor</span><sup><a href="#cmnt45" id="cmnt_ref45">[as]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;his subordinates, thus gain intelligence through their points of view.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He gained the intelligence regarding the revival of &#12300;Storm Dragon&#12301;Veldora through it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">It wasn&rsquo;t anything of interest to him, by chance he overheard some conversations worth investigating made by the group of humans who appeared to have been kept alive even after communicating with the storm dragon. The information Clayman got through eavesdropping the men dressed like adventurers who were leaving the </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;town turns out to be a huge surprise to him. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was how it went.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The self-proclaimed leader of the Jura Forest Rimuru in fact, did not eliminate the Falmas army. That was due to the revival of Storm dragon which led to the disappearance of that entire army even to this day. And it is rumored that the dragon has lost more than half of its magicule after its recent revival.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That would prove why the vast Jura &nbsp;forest has not shown much magical reaction and why the adventurers were lucky enough to survive to retell these stories and reveal the fact to Clayman. If the &#12300;Storm Dragon&#12301; Veldora has been revived, Clayman, a Demon Lord, could not have missed it out. It is most likely true as the rumor goes the battle against the Falmas army has likely depleted most of his power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These two pieces of intelligence gave Clayman headache.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Why not we go wage war against the evil dragon now and defeat it at ease. On top of that, it may probably even be of use to me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, Clayman has ambition as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">It would seem that the evil dragon has made its base at the town built by the </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s, which would make intelligence gathering harder around the area, but&hellip;.. He thinks it&rsquo;s nothing to be rushed as of the moment. That evil dragon won&rsquo;t be able to restore its strength in two or three days, so he can take care of it after the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">If the situation remains against our favour, I&rsquo;ll just send Milim to deal with it. Compared to that, I should&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon thinking so, Clayman decides to focus on dealing with the Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps he shouldn&rsquo;t have put that much faith in Milim&rsquo;s power&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman must have realized as well, that there are many suspicious points.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemy has suffered no casualty by now and it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense. Besides, the survivors who are supposed to be scattered all over the region are now gathering up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These intelligence are too important for the cautious Clayman to overlook.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But right now, the man in charge of the operation at the scene is Yamza, not Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from that, Clayman&rsquo;s head has been preoccupied with the incoming Walpurgis Banquet. It holds a significant purpose.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The renowned autist (shut-in) Demon Lord Ramiris suddenly demanded to add on a proposal and requested to have the person in question, Rimuru to attend the Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Clayman could not have anticipated this turn of event, letting him unable to make a judgement for the time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When he was concerning, everyone else just decided to accept the proposal. Now there is no room to rebut.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But at this point, the crisis may have turned into an opportunity.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">No, this is perfect in fact. In the end, Rimuru would show his true colour. I almost got fooled around </span><span class="c4 c8">by him about him</span><sup><a href="#cmnt46" id="cmnt_ref46">[at]</a></sup><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;taking on the entire Falams army alone and triumphed. You can&rsquo;t conceal a lie like that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman gives off a cunning grin as he thinks so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Rimuru wishes to join the Banquet, why not I welcome his participation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman just has to show the difference in strength between Rimuru and himself in front of the rest of the demon lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">A lowly slime tries to act all mighty with the aid of an evil dragon! You should feel honored to be defeated by my hands.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman thinks over about his glorious future.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;However, he has overlooked something.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Overlooked the slight lack of balance in the battlefield.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Be careful Clayman! Don&rsquo;t act recklessly without thinking, and you&rsquo;d better not get careless.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The words of his friend cross his mind for a second.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman feels a sudden sense of unease.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is almost as if it&rsquo;s telling him that he has missed out certain piece of the jigsaw.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Clayman instead, decides to laugh it off.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Don&rsquo;t worry, Laplace. I will win&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if he&rsquo;s trying to shake off the unease, Clayman downs the rest of the wine in a go.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey, with a worrying heart, prepares for the upcoming Walpurgis Banquet .</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The situation has changed completely within a short period of time that it has completely deviated from the initial plan.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt47" id="cmnt_ref47">[au]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now with everything developing out of her expectation, she has no idea what the outcomewould be.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Frey is not nervous about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She knows herself well that she will conduct everything calmly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is how &#12300;The Harpy Queen&#12301; Frey should behave.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s definitely a good thing to have an ideal outcome, but if things continue to develop towards the wrongdirection&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She has made up her mind to be personally involved if that time arrives.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since she has made a deal with someone from that day onward.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to defeat Charybdis, she accepted a proposal from Clayman. Its cost being for Frey to agree to a request of Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few months ago, Milim came to visit Frey.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pang&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! With that sound, she opened the door rudely and entered the room.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This happens too often, so Frey was somewhataccustomed to it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, if any such immense and unconcealed magical aura ever approaches, it&rsquo;s anyone guesses that it would be Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim walked in to greet her immediately.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hey, Frey! Nice weather today!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With smiles on her face, she didn&rsquo;t care whether Frey was available to receive her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She also intentionally used her hand to brush through her beautiful cherry-gold hair.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is some strange-looking object equipped on her fingers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not a ring.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young girl seems to have equipped a rough-edged knuckle used to protect four of her fingers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it seems rather fitting to Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This skillfully crafted item is engraved with dragon patterns that possess strong magicule.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It doesn&rsquo;t look strange at all being held in her tiny hands.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm&mdash;&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t it quite hot here?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She said so while using her palm as a fan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim has never been mindful of temperature before, so her motive is quite clear.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ara, Milim. Long time no see, you seem to be in a good mood today. Did something good happen to you?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey asked as she played along with her. If she did not ask, Milim would continue to keep up the act with her till the ends of time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm~hmm, can you tell? It&rsquo;s actually like this, check it out!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim said so while showing off the dragon patterned knuckles on her hands.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And she shows off while saying &ldquo;hehehe~&rdquo;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey didn&#39;t know what to do with her and could only sigh in her heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Well indeed that&rsquo;s true! I think it suits you very well. How did you come across it?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She guessed that Milim would want her to ask more, so she did.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim, on the other, hand starts to beat around the bush: &#12300;Do you want to know? Now what should I do&mdash;&mdash;I guess I can tell you&hellip;.Hmm&mdash;&mdash;what to do, what to do&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Annoying. Such an act is even irritating to Frey who&rsquo;s been used to her actions for all these years of interactions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, Milim. Aren&rsquo;t we &ldquo;Friends&rdquo;? So it should be fine to tell me, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&rsquo;s eyes shines hearing Frey&rsquo;s words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right! Indeed, indeed. We are friends! Alright, I&rsquo;ll tell you! As a matter of fact&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">She seemed happy hearing Frey&rsquo;s words. Milim then started to tell Frey all about the </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;town happily.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey kept on listening to her unstopping bragging and was forced to admire different outfits of hers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey couldn&rsquo;t hide her confusion since she has never seen Milim been in such a happy state.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But with that being said, Frey determined it was time to carry out her promise with Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, Milim. As a &ldquo;Friend&rdquo;, I would like to gift you something. Are you willing to take it?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After which, Frey signalled her maid.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The maid brought an object to them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a beautiful shining pendant with a purple fabric as a base. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The pendant has a beautiful orb engraved onto it. It&rsquo;s most certainly top-ranked goods, the type that even outsiders could tell it costs a fortune.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm? Isn&rsquo;t this a pendant? Can I take it? But I won&rsquo;t give you my knuckles even if I take this from you!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey responded with a wry smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No problem, Milim. This thing shall symbolize our friendship. Since it&rsquo;s a gift from &ldquo;Friend&rsquo;, you don&rsquo;t have to be courteous with me. I&rsquo;d be happy if you are willing to wear it.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey hurries her with a kind smile, and Milim nods while smiling.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then just wait and see!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After which, Milim puts it on her with a smile on her face.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Forbidden curse &#12300;Demon Lord Domination&#12301;...... Conjured successfully.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, the expression on Milim&rsquo;s face faded instantly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was nothing else in her eyes, the light within them that symbolizes consciousness has faded away.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The pendant has released its magic and the forbidden curse has corrupted Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">This pendant was the secret jewel given to </span><span class="c4">Frey</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;by Clayman&mdash;&mdash;The orb of domination. As for why she let Milim put on the pendant, it was because this was the deal she made with Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Alight, I&rsquo;ve done my part of the bargain. Then my duty is now done, what would happen to Milim&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey begins to observe Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looks like a human doll with masquerade on, just standing there without any emotion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a moment, there were weak signs of struggle. Frey seemed to have crossed her eyes with Milim&rsquo;s blue eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">For that instant, Frey senses something was amiss.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Could it be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Right, that means&hellip;. That&rsquo;s what it was, right, Milim&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dragon knuckles slipped through Milim&rsquo;s joints and fell.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey loosened her breath seeing this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s done Clayman. Will this do?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was nothing in the shades of the room. Frey talked naturally towards a specific place.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There on the spot emerged a shadow, it was Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hohoho. Thanks for the trouble, Frey. Looks like now I&rsquo;ve gained the strongest puppet! Gohahahaha&mdash;&mdash;! This is what happens when you look down on me as some newbie Demon Lord. How embarrassing you look now, Milim!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman lets out his laughter and begins to hit Milim hard with his hands.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&rsquo;s tender cheek begins to swell and her lips are spl.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without the multiple &#12300;Barrier&#12301;to defend herself, even Milim would be injured.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This pluses the opponent being Clayman, a Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course she would bleed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman, with a light smile on his face, decides to continue his attack, however Frey responded coldly: &#12300;I&rsquo;d suggest you refrain yourself.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is no comfortable scene to look at, besides&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh! Don&rsquo;t you think that this curse is some cheap shot that would be deactivated with a couple of hits. This is a forbidden curse with a massive amount of my magic inserted. Aren&rsquo;t you annoyed too that she&rsquo;s always acting all smug? That&rsquo;s why you assisted me in the first place, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No. I did it to simply carry out our promise.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t act all high and mighty now. You are welcome. This guy is just a puppet now, a very endurable one, as long as I repair it before breaking it completely.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman&rsquo;s eyes showed signs of madness as he gives Milim a kick to send her flying away. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey looks at Clayman&rsquo;s actions with cold eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">What an ugly man. So this is your nature&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, Frey has seen through this man named Clayman. From now on, she decides to trust her instinct and take actions on her own.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I mean, Clayman. You may not be aware but Milim has a self-defense mechanism. I once heard it from Milim that it is called &#12302;Frenzy Berserk&#12303;. It would lead her to an uncontrolled state. You can go ahead and get yourself killed by it, just leave me out of it.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Frey&rsquo;s reminder, Clayman finally regained calmness.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He smacks his lip with discontent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;*smacks lip* Ze, what&rsquo;s wrong with this demon lord&hellip; Anyway, if I play her right, I&rsquo;ll get more of a voice during my speech. Frey, you are my accomplice. So you&rsquo;d better work for me like a doll. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Are? Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to be on equal term?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You idiot! I made this plan. You are already my pawn. Or perhaps, you want to take a brawl with Milim?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Are you threatening me?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Gohahahah! Whichever way you like to see it. If you don&rsquo;t want to die, you&rsquo;d better stay on my good side.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">To impose someone with both threats and compassion</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c0">, that would be an appropriate phrase to describe Clayman&rsquo;s arrogant speech.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, the plan was made by Clayman, plus information from unknown sources.After all Milim can&rsquo;t quite resist the word &ldquo;Friend&rdquo;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey is merely following her deal. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the reason why she committed to it was because she has faith in certain things&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;...I understand.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right. Don&rsquo;t even think about betraying me. If you&rsquo;d like to hear my request, I&rsquo;ll allow you to continue as &nbsp;&#12302;Ruler of the sky&#12303;. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is at the point of no return.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, Frey has fallen as Clayman&rsquo;s accomplice&mdash;&mdash;or his puppet in reality.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;These are the events that took place several weeks before the day of destruction.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Having withdrawn from the memory of that time, Frey sighs quietly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman has full control over Milim. With such violent power to back himself up, he&rsquo;s able to put high pressure on Frey as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now, Frey follows Clayman&rsquo;s order and is forced to be his accomplice. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This must have been her own doing&mdash;&mdash;She mocks herself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was stupid enough to have trusted Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, on the other hand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is a cunning Demon Lord that can&rsquo;t be underestimated. He has too much confidence in his own strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;This is why it has colluded Clayman from seeing the nature of things.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But luckily, Frey possesses the insights to see the nature of things.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is no skill, but simply the result of her interactions with other people.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman only sees others as tools, thus he may never see the truth of things.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey decides to trust her own instinct and make a gamble.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter what the result is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Clayman, you won&rsquo;t live for any longer.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey confirms the sequence of actions planned by her in heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then she recalls the &#12300;Promise&#12301;, and a smile crawls up her cheek without her noticing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the frozen land where the freezing breezes of icy wind blows.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The surrounding of this land consists of ice plains with permanently frozen soil. The temperature is </span><span class="c4">below a hundred and twenty Celsius</span><sup><a href="#cmnt48" id="cmnt_ref48">[av]</a></sup><span class="c0">, which very few living beings could survive under. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A castle stands tall in the central area.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A castle of beauty and fantasy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A demon fortress projected to the physical realm through the use of unimaginable amount of magicule. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Its name is &#12300;Palace of White Ice&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the residence of Demon Lord Guy Crimson.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Someone is stroking casually on the hallway of the castle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The person has long blonde hair, below which his long and narrow blue eyes as well as his handsome appearance display a heavenly sight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those plus his smooth, white tender skin.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a handsome man with incredibly beautiful appearance that would make other question his gender.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is Demon Lord Leon Cromwell, the so called &#12300;Platinum Demon&#12301;or &#12300;Platinum Saber&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s treating the castle as if it&rsquo;s his home and stroking around the hallway without a care.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A giant door lies in front of him, along it are beautiful sculptures. This door leads to the main hall where the ruler of the castle awaits. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon came to look for the ruler Guy Crimson. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He stood before the door and waited for the two strong demons to come forth and open the door. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Afterward&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Demon Lord Leon Cromwell-sama has arrived!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A beautiful demon with female form stood in the inner side of the door and announces </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The powerful greater demons split into two rows and await by the two sides of the door. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are all named demons with flesh. Their strength has already surpassed greater demon, and could even easily outrank greater Majins. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are all equipped with magical equipments and all seem to have evolved. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In total, there are around two hundreds of them. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are even ones that may rival Special A Calamity. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, even though these demons are considered top-notch in strength&hellip;&hellip; </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Deep into the meeting hall, the demon lord Guy Crimson sits in his throne at the center. Right now there are six great demon lords awaiting his order. The rest of the demons seem far inferior when compared to the prestige displayed by the six. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 554.00px; height: 791.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image11.png" style="width: 554.00px; height: 791.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All six demons are named Greater Demon General. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They all possess combat abilities to crash many among the rank of Calamity. It is likely that they may even have power to rival Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;But, even these six Great Demon Generals are not allowed to speak without permission here. This is due to the uncrossable gap in authority&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just now it was a green-hair demon that informed the hall of Leon&rsquo;s visit and a blue-hair demon that tended to him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their beautiful appearances are like human desire manifested.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both of whose fit bodies are covered by dark red maid suits.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The green-hair demon is named Misery, the Blue-hair demon&rsquo;s is Rain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They speak for their king.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These two great demons are the left and right hands of the absolute ruler Guy Crimson. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their rank &#12300;Demon Noble&#12301;, make them the strongest among the Calamity class.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their power is sufficient to rival Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon walks down the central path and stops below the throne.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Misery and Rain bow to him and proceed to stand beside Guy on each side.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, the king stands up from his throne.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The only two persons who are permitted to move in the room are now only the two demon lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Long time no see, my friend Leon. How have you been? I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve responded to my invitation. I should thank you for that.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is a wonderfully alluring voice.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His crimson red eyes has sparkled gold stars within; His slightly curly hair looks scarlet red like burning flame, its redness is thicker than the color of blood.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s about the same height as Leon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As opposed to Leon&rsquo;s feminine beauty, Guy&rsquo;s beauty comes from a place of pride and lonesomeness.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such eerily bizarre beauty exudes the aura of an overlord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He speaks to Leon and starts to move down from his high throne to Leon&rsquo;s face. His hands gradually wrapped around Leon&rsquo;s chest and hugs him close tightly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His hands continue to move and fondle along Leon&rsquo;s face, and without hesitation, kisses him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon&rsquo;s face frowns with disgust and pushes Guy away. He starts to complain as usual:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Stop it. I&rsquo;m not interested in men. Haven&rsquo;t I told you this several times already?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His face looks confused as it stares at Guy angrily.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ahahaha. You are such a cold man as always. But if that&rsquo;s what you want, I&rsquo;m fine with being a woman. But let&rsquo;s put that aside and change a place to talk&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy sounds rather pleased this time and starts to move before hearing Leon&rsquo;s response.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This scene plays out every time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this frozen land, Guy wears a truly unique outfit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The outfit he wears have many openings, exposing his skin.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even so, as a demon, Guy doesn&rsquo;t mind coldness. To him it does not even tickle him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A sudden bewitching smile emerges on Guy&rsquo;s beautiful face as he recalls the taste of Leon&rsquo;s lip.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He licks his bloody lips with his snake-like tongue&hellip;.. It&#39;s a rather intriguing scenery that bears a devilish charm.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy could switch his gender at will, and both men and women can invoke his lust.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is him&mdash;&mdash;her&mdash;&mdash;This is the Demon Lord Guy Crimson. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The owner of this castle, the strongest, most ancient Demon Lord&mdash;&mdash;The overlord of this forever frozen continent, who rules in the name of &#12300;Lord of Darkness&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy didn&rsquo;t tend to Leon and walk in front by himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon naturally follows behind him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before the two could exit the hall, no one present dares to make a single noise.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since that is not permitted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone bows their heads low and await quietly before their master and the guest to leave.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After confirming Leon has left, Misery and Rain raise up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They thus say:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Dismiss.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rain herself also gives order to several subordinates. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Misery and Rain thus leave to prepare tea for the guest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They have the highest position among the demons in the castle, and their role however, happen to be taking care of their master, Demon Lord Guy Crimson&rsquo;s daily chores. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s not any work more important than theirs in this castle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Before their master loses his temper, they&rsquo;d better hurry up with their work.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon followed Guy to the top of the frost balcony. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although the location is open to outside, not a single flake of snow is allowed to enter.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It has been made into a comfortable space after accomodation. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy isn&rsquo;t affected by the environment at all. However, the air-conditioning mechanism is specially made for Leon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy is arrogant and prideful, but he&rsquo;s very caring towards those who he recognizes and his friends.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy&rsquo;s still the same way. Leon thinks to himself while he sits down with Guy&rsquo;s invitation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The chair is made of ice, yet the there is no sense of chilliness felt from it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon though isn&rsquo;t surprised at all. He instead inquires:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So, why did you call me here?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He falls back to his chair as the ice chair catches him gently.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same as usual.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Somehow a ice table appears out of nowhere, and Rain begins to serve tea to them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Misery quitely awaits outside of the balcony entrance.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They won&rsquo;t at all interfere with the conversation between their master and his guest. Not a single word is permitted to be spoken.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no equal relationship here. Before they receive their order, they can&rsquo;t even express any emotion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they are to do anything without Guy&rsquo;s order, they would be gifted with death on the spot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It matters little that they are &#12300;Demon Noble&#12301;with immense power. They are nothing but tools in front of demon lord such as Guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s how strong Guy is.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is why even if Leon launches an attack on Guy, they will not intervene on their own.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy is the absolute ruler and it would be a great disrespect to even worry about Guy&rsquo;s safety.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why they are being treated like air. And the conversation continued. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm. As you can see, the Walpurgis Banquet is about to start. But I mean to take you there even by force this time.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ho? Forcing me to participate? That&rsquo;s unusual.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah. Consider doing me a favor, but I&rsquo;m getting you to attend regardless!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Why is that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ha, you&rsquo;re still the same way, always so careful. Very well, perhaps I&rsquo;ll fill you in then&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy shows a joyful smile and said so, thus begins his explanation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;The one proposing the meeting this time is Clayman, no one special. But, the strange thing is Milim was listed as seconder. Milim is one of the most ancient demon lord like me, how could she be playing along some scum like Clayman? It can only mean&mdash;&mdash; &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;There&rsquo;s something strange about Karion&rsquo;s death. Is that where you are trying to get?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehh, so you do know about it.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy&rsquo;s mood got a lot worse having been guessed what he&rsquo;s trying to say. But Leon didn&rsquo;t seem to care and continues with his words:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Clayman really went above the line this time. He&rsquo;s always been causing trouble for me without leaving any trace, but this time I can&rsquo;t just sit and take it. Apart from the whereabout of Karion, it&rsquo;ll be trouble if Milim moves out.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He says so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing so, Guy nods happily.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, that&rsquo;s exactly my thought. It may be a game to Milim just like before, but if the balance among Demon Lords are to be broken, it won&rsquo;t be child&rsquo;s play anymore. I&rsquo;ll certainly have to do more work. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy regained his good mood, followed by Leon who asks the most pressing question: </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;By the way, Guy. Do you think Milim have been manipulated by Clayman?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The question is asked, but Guy&rsquo;s response shows his lack of care towards the issue.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It won&rsquo;t matter much to worry over Milim&rsquo;s business. Smart people like me will never understand what an idiot is thinking. That is one of my few weakness.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He shrugs as he finishes and throws a smile him a smile. Then he turns the topic back on the original question.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Look how concerned you look now. Leon, does this mean you are interested in taking part in the Banquet, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no use trying to probe the thoughts of one another, so Leon decides to reply honestly:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, I was planning to. Although I hate to spend time around others, I guess I&rsquo;ll have to participate this time.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh? That&rsquo;s great. And I was planning to spend the night with you (on bottom) then&mdash;&mdash; &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I told you I don&rsquo;t do it with man. And even if it&rsquo;s a woman, I won&rsquo;t do it with ones I don&rsquo;t like. Plus I don&rsquo;t get stand to gain anything sleeping with you....&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehhh, don&rsquo;t be so hasty now. If you really mean it, I can turn myself into a woman&hellip;&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as Leon finishes, Guy begins to harass Leon all seductive looking. But Leon has expected that and gave him a perfect counter</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two often play this game of offense and defense.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, Leon. Ramiris seldom expresses her opinion, so how much do you know about the person called &ldquo;Rimuru&rdquo;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Leon won&rsquo;t bite, Guy changes to another topic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is also related to the topic at hand. There has been new demon lord after Leon, and the rest of the demon lords seem to be interested in this topic as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;From Clayman&rsquo;s testimony, he seemed to have crowned himself the title Demon Lord without our approval. I personally think that this Rimuru guy can be a Demon Lord if he is powerful enough.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, so you think he&rsquo;s qualified. Ramiris also came to stir the pot. I&rsquo;m rather intrigued by this whole ordeal since it was sufficient to get her interest. I definitely can have some fun with this Rimuru. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman was the one initiating the Banquet, and with Ramiris&rsquo; request, the person involved Rimuru would also join.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So they can safely deduce that Ramiris has a say to Clayman&rsquo;s action this time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Ramiris, well. I&rsquo;m no good against that elf. Everytime we meet she makes fun of me.I kinda want to strangle her to death for a few times&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even so, since Ramiris has already spoken, Leon could only nod in agreement. He still feels some moral responsibility towards her, so he has to comply. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ahahaha. Come on now. If you kill Ramiris, I&rsquo;ll become your enemy then.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I thought as much. But it&rsquo;s me saying. Plus I stand no chance against you anyway.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s true.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon only dislikes Ramiris for making fun of him, he doesn&rsquo;t really mean any harm to her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, Leon stands no chance winning against Guy. That part is true too. Despite both of them are all demon lords, their difference in power is heaven and earth.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy&rsquo;s power is almost from a different dimension compared to people like Leon and Misery.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm? How could that be? If it is you, you still have a one in a million chance to kill me, you know?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No way. I only fight battles that I can win.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Come on, don&rsquo;t be so modest. Basically, there&rsquo;re very few people who can hurt me. I may actually die in your hand, since you are a powerful guy, Leon. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Heh, you don&rsquo;t say. It&rsquo;s because you are Milim are way too strong. Speaking of being unreasonably strong&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon recalls something while saying so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;He heard that &#12300;Storm Dragon&#12301;Veldora has awakened. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That would be a first that Leon has surprised Guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, a voice cold as ice interrupts the two&rsquo;s conversation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ara ara, now that is intriguing.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The owner of the voice is a beautiful female. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One with snow white skin like porcelain. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her eyes that emits cold light is seductive and they are blue like the deep sea. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her pearl-white hair droops down along her cheek and her light red lips look extremely eye-catching.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman walked forward and spoke without Guy&rsquo;s permission.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She possesses a beautiful aura around her more shining than jewels. People call her &#12300;Ice Empress&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She has a better known name, &#12300;White Ice Dragon&#12301; Velzado.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is the one of the four remaining &#12300;True Dragon&#12301;, a friend&mdash;&mdash;and partner to the Demon Lord Guy Crimson.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, she gets to sit on equal ground to Guy like Leon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, It&rsquo;s Velzado. That being said, I almost forgot that there is a &#12302;True Dragon&#12303; here too.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon plays dumb and says.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ayy? Aren&rsquo;t you cold as always? But, I&rsquo;m pretty happy you decided to show up.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so? I also get to have a eyes&rsquo; full of you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon and Velzado exchanges some polite greets.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Boths&rsquo; are pretenses.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh. You two are always like this, just can&rsquo;t get along with each other.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy&rsquo;s rather irritated while saying so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said though, Guy doesn&rsquo;t plan to help mitigate their relation at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it&rsquo;s usual, they would continue to exchange those fake-sounding courtesy, but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;right, so as you were saying&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time, Velzado took the initiative in changing the topic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Leon-sama, did you just say that my &ldquo;younger brother&rdquo; has awaken?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her blue eyes shine as she asks, meaning to see if Leon&rsquo;s shocking news is true or not. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that true, Leon?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;His presence disappears around two years ago, and I thought he was gone for good.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Veldora is revived, the overwhelming magicule outburst will most certainly cause drastic change to climate of the land for them to notice. However, there was no sign of such a thing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why both Guy and Velzado are surprised.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;There&rsquo;s no way around it. The source came from the spies I sent to the western states. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh&hellip;..? If that&rsquo;s true, why have that evil dragon been so quiet? Has he weakened so much that he can&rsquo;t even resupply his own magicule on his own?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;On top of that, who could have broken the seal on that child? I thought he doesn&rsquo;t possess the power to break it by himself&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Veldora was sealed by a Chosen Hero</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Veldoza&rsquo;s view, it was the appropriate punishment for her reckless brother. So she has intentionally left the seal as it was. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he reflects himself well and finally decides to be a doll. Velzado would have given him a helping hand before he gets completely eliminated. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Veldora first disappeared from the world, she was rather confused. Since the time of his destruction seems too early compared to the time Velzado has predicted. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;From the report of the spy, Clayman&rsquo;s conspiracy seems to have been the main cause. He forced the western state to take actions, the great kingdom of Falmas to be particular. He found people to instigate them to invade and eliminate the Jura Forest Alliance built by Rimuru. As it turns out, the Falmas army was completely decimated. And now Rimuru comes out and calls himself a demon lord. &nbsp;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You know your stuff well, Leon.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Of course. Unlike you, I used to be human. Apart from that, I confirmed that Veldora was indeed resting near the frontline of the battle. It is rumored that the truth of the matter is that Veldora, almost near his demise was able to awake after absorbing the large amount of blood tainted on the battlefield. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru was able to escape from danger after Falmas army was involved in this whole ordeal and was eliminated completely. Leon adds on top of his explanation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So that was the case. Then was the breaking of seal just a coincidence? &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t know. I wasn&rsquo;t informed on that matter.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s true too, Velzado nods in response.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon&rsquo;s correct, there&rsquo;s no way to judge that simply from espionage. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Chosen Hero&rsquo;s unique skill &#12300;Infinite Prison&#12301; was able to lock the targeted object into an imaginary space. It isn&rsquo;t weak enough to have it revoked from the affected individual trapped inside. But even if that&rsquo;s the case, the presence of Veldora has yet to influence the world.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Perhaps there&rsquo;s some flaws with Chosen Hero&rsquo;s seal&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That would make more sense.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velzado thinks so, yet Leon expresses something unexpected to her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s possible. But allow me to propose a theory. What if someone created a subspace that absorbed both veldora and the seal?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The theory interests with Guy as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Interesting! If that&rsquo;s the case, this unknown individual could then unlock the Chosen Hero&rsquo;s seal. That sel seems to have a special tie with the Chosen Hero and cannot be undone using normal skills. It may be solvable if we are the one dealing with it, in other words, this mysterious person has power to rival us.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy says so with great pleasure.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But regardless, it&rsquo;s just a possibility.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So you think that mysterious individual is &ldquo;Rimuru&rdquo;, right, Leon?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s right.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I see. If that&rsquo;s the case, I do need to meet him.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Guy thought Leon&rsquo;s difference in attitude in attending the meeting is a rare sight of a lifetime. But if this is the case, that would certainly make more sense. Guy finally realizes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is being reckless.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim has been acting weird.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Rimuru proclaims himself Demon Lord alongside with Veldora losing his seal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we assume all of these events are all connected&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Walpurgis Banquet has indeed become very interesting. An intoxicating smile emerges on Guy&rsquo;s face as he thinks so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But suddenly something came up on his mind that concerns him, Guy starts to mumble:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But speaking of that, why has Veldora become so quiet?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velzado makes the following response.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;He seems to have become weak. The reaction is extremely weak, hardly as powerful as before.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velzado is also a &#12300;True Dragon&#12301;, so Veldora&rsquo;s presence hasn&rsquo;t been so weak that she can&rsquo;t find with some efforts.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would make the most sense if it due to him becoming weaker&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But, it&rsquo;s rather disappointing that he hasn&rsquo;t gone on a rampage by now. If it&rsquo;s that child&rsquo;s personality, chaos is his way of life.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velzado also doesn&rsquo;t get why that was the case.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Anyhow, it doesn&#39;t matter. I&rsquo;m not really interested in Veldora. If you guys want to get him on board, then be my guest.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon says so without a care and decides to stand up from his seat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike Velzado who are the same race as Veldora, or Guy who is worrying about what to about him, this is all none of Leon&rsquo;s business. As long as Veldora stays away from Leon&rsquo;s territory, he won&rsquo;t actively care about what Veldora does.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is how difficult it is to deal with the evil dragon Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Are you leaving already?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, didn&rsquo;t you call me for these?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehh, just wait a little longer, don&rsquo;t be in such a rush? Right, have you got any closer to your &ldquo;specific summoning&rdquo;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to prevent Leon from leaving, Guy asks him about the result of his experiments.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is after all, experiments Leon spent all his life investing. So Guy is also quite interested in the result.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;......well, about that, I haven&rsquo;t made much progress. I&rsquo;ve changed my method to random summoning but it always ended up in failure. It&rsquo;s also attracting too much attention. I had intentionally theorized &ldquo;incomplete summoning&rdquo; and leaked the news to the western states. But then the Freedom Association began to intervene. The current method is hardly efficient considering the probabilities, and since there may be more people come and try to intervene. I am considering to try an alternative in the future. &nbsp;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Honestly, Leon has little interest for the Walpurgis Banquet or the new Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He simply wants to eliminate any possible threat that may intervene his research early. That is all he cared. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You said intervention?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah. They saved a bunch of kids who were going to die anyway&mdash;&mdash;before I could receive the them.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I see. So they were taken away by force before you got the results. Then, these recuerser would likely intervene in the future too.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s probably the case. That guy seems to be also annoyed by the summoning of children around the countries, so he may even pressure these countries. Given the circumstance, I won&rsquo;t continue my experiment. If I am to continue, I may get exposed of being behind the scene one day.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, why don&rsquo;t you just eliminate the nuisance?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It should be a chore if it&rsquo;s you right? Guy sends the signal through his eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, Leon instead sighs to Guy&rsquo;s words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;The nuisance individual happens to be the &ldquo;Rimuru&rdquo; I just mentioned.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Nani? Could this really be just coincidence?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Isn&rsquo;t that interesting? That&rsquo;s why I wish to see him as well.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon nods looking all serious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said, had Ramiris not come and stir the pot, he may have overlooked the issue&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so, now I&rsquo;m even more interested in him. Perhaps Milim thought the same way like me. That girl may be silly, but her instinct is quite keen.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Perhaps. Anyway, there&rsquo;s gonna be hell of a show during tonight&rsquo;s Banquet.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehe, that&rsquo;s right.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon saying so, the two smiles at each other.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velzado observes the two on the side with a gentle look in her blue eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that they continued to chat with joy for a while before Guy changed the subject:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Speaking of which, I&rsquo;ve been curious about something. Who is the supplier of your intelligences all this time?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;He apparently came from the Eastern Empire. I&rsquo;ve got no clue about the detail. He&rsquo;s a self-proclaimed merchant.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to summon &#12300;Otherworlder&#12301;, it requires a large amount of magicule, specific conditions and rituals. There are many complicated factors involved.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The more sufficient one prepares with these factors in mind, the longer interval it will be for one to prepare a second summoning.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why Leon has made a deal with that merchant to have him conduct the summoning in his place.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So, is this merchant trust-worthy?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Trust? I have no use for that, I&rsquo;m simply manipulating him for now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so? Do what you like, I&rsquo;ve got no objection. But don&rsquo;t get careless with it! I won&rsquo;t allow you to die without my permission.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehehe, are you worrying about me? How rare, Guy. Don&rsquo;t worry. I won&rsquo;t just die without achieving my goal.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Here we go again&hellip;. Is that thing really this important?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah it is. To me, it&rsquo;s the most important thing in the world.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so? That makes me jealous.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Spare the sweet talk. I&rsquo;ll keep your advice in mind. Then, I&rsquo;ll see you tonight.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said, Leon leaves the castle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time Guy did not try to stop him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">There are crystals of light</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;left at the scene as Leon exits with &#12300;Dimensional Transportation&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two pairs of eyes observe as he departed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;He&rsquo;s always in such a rush. Well, that&rsquo;s Leon for you&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy gives off a wry smile while saying so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But Leon has always been cautious. Yet this time his plans are flawed with exploits. He doesn&#39;t seem to know the identity of his assistor. Should we help him to find it out?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velzado asks in a cold tone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No need for that. If we trespass his business too much, Leon would be upset. I don&rsquo;t wish to be disliked by my friend.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy answers, without a shred of worry. To Guy, his friend Leon is a trustworthy man. He said so knowing Leon&rsquo;s personality. He knows it better than anymore that Leon is a hardworking guy. If Leon never sought to uncover the identity of his assistors, it simply means that it&rsquo;s not necessary for him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ll help him out when he does come to seek help from me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I understand.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After which, the two ended the discussion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, the list of attendees of tonight&rsquo;s Walpurgis Banquet has been settled.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The proposers are Clayman, Frey and Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And of course Ramiris who requested an amendment of participant.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The shut-in Leon has also decided to join.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s another person who hates to show up in public. That Demon Lord&rsquo;s whereabout has been unknown. But Guy has forced the person out using Demon Lords&rsquo; special communication channel. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additionally, there are Guy&rsquo;s old friend Dagruel and a certain other&hellip;.. He won&rsquo;t need to worry about him since Dagruel has agreed to bring him along.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lastly, it&rsquo;s Guy himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from Karion, who has been missing for sometime. The Ten Great Demon Lords are finally reuniting after some time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;This seems to be fun. Do you want to come along?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;About that&hellip;. No, I&rsquo;ll pass. But it will be a different case if I see my brother there, otherwise I&rsquo;m not interested in demon lords.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so? It matters not. Then you can look after the house for me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Sure, leave it to me. You should go get ready too now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velzado leaves her seat after saying so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now only Guy remains. He looks far away to what seems to be the polar light spread on this frozen land and has his mind fixed on the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demon lords who only plays tricks and sabotages behind everyone&rsquo;s back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Someone supposedly is a new Demon Lord yet got destroyed so easily.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His shut-in friend also got a move-on, which makes him reminiscent of the past.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the birth of a new demon lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Interesting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His mood hasn&rsquo;t been so hyped up for several hundreds years.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s time for some major reforms.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, the Demon Lords are never companions, but competing opponents.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first, the number of Demon Lords are not limited to ten persons. In fact, there was once a time that there were more than dozens of Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It matters very little whether is it ten or a hundred.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you can&rsquo;t do your part, you will get eliminated through the &#12300;Great War Between Angels and Demons&#12301;(Tenma Daisen) commenced every five hundred years.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are always new power rising through the great war. But gradually the cap of members was fixed to ten persons. To the people who are aware of this, they thus call them the Ten Great Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;s not approved by Guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To humans, it would be in their best interests to have the dangerous demon lords continued to fight against each others&rsquo; rule and reduce in number through the process. But somehow, the Ten Great Demon Lords become an unspoken rule.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, this rule is about to be struck off.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The weak does not deserve the title &#12300;Demon Lord&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s about time for the real deal to dominate the world again.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;That is Guy&rsquo;s opinion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy was the first Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As one of the Seven Primordial Demons, he was summoned to earth as a Greater Demon General.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;The unnamed Primordial Red (Rouge) was unleashed to the world that day.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He granted the wishes of the humans without power to decimate what was suspected to their hostile nations in war against. He later also destroyed the human kingdom that summoned him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As his reward, he gained this name.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The desperate sighs of humans that he heard sounded similar to the word &#12300;Guy&#12301;. It became his name.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After obtaining a name, Guy discovered that he has awakened to be a true demon lord. Although to Guy, who had already believed deeply that he is the strongest being, the power was unnecessary.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Due to Guy&rsquo;s evolution, it also affected the Primordial Green (Vert) and Primordial Blue (Bleu) who were summoned to do his chores.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two, who were called the shadow of Primordial Red, gained body like Guy and became &#12300;Demon Noble&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy, intrigued at the time, allowed them to follow him and granted them names.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Primordial Green was named according the painful expression displayed on the humans, &#12300;Misery&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Primordial Blue was named according to the red rain due to the bloodshed, &#12300;Rain&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From that day onward, he granted both permission to stay around him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sometime after Guy awaked to become a demon lord, it didn&rsquo;t take long before someone else awaked to become a true demon lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That someone was Milim,</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ancestors of the four &#12300;True Dragons&#12301;emerged to the physical world and bred with humans.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What incredible thing was that the &#12300;True Dragon&#12301;who reproduced with humans were deprived of most of its power by their offspring. From then on, the breeding of True Dragon and Human became a taboo.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The true dragon who lost its power exploded into pieces. But it was successful in obtaining flesh on the ground world. It became the ancestors of dragon race.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The future generation would instead call the &#12300;Holy Will of Nature&#12301;as the&#12300;True Dragon&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nowadays, the dragon race is able to prosper on this land and its origin can all be traced o this one ancestor dragon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the &#12300;True Dragon&#12301;&mdash;&mdash;&#12300;Star King Dragon&#12301;Veldanava.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The &#12300;Star King Dragon&#12301;Veldanava gifted his his reincarnated self&mdash;&mdash;a small dragon to her daughter as a pet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That small dragon was killed in a certain kingdom.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those fools enraged the tyrant Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her fury tore through the sky and earth as she destroyed the country.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And later Milim was awakened to be a true demon lord</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;As Milim, who has lost her reasoning, continued on to rain destruction on the world </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The one that came forth and stopped her was Guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They fought seven days and nights.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They fought until the world turned dark, rendering the prosper land of the west a land of death.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But in the end, neither were able to come to a conclusion of victory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Due to Milim regaining her senses, the battle got to be ended.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The one that restored her reasoning was Ramiris. She came down to the earth as the Queen of Elves and utilized all of power to neutralize the hatred within Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the price was nonetheless high.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris&rsquo; power gradually dissipate due to the tainting of both the evil spirit of both Dragon and Demon. In the end she fell from grace and ended up where she is today. A fairy who is in perpetual reincarnations. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although the price was so high, she was successful in stopping Milim from continuing her rampage.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To prevent world destruction, both Guy and Milim accepted a truce.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These three were the original Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Three persons pursued three different goals.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One pursued absolute power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One wanted to live life freely.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One hoped for world peace.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, those would suffice.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three got to know each other precisely for their difference in end goals.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that, the Titan guarding the gateway to the sky and the ancient Vampire also become Demon Lord. The Fallen angel then took the sixth seat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are the second generation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are far from the ancient Demon Lords, but nonetheless, the pinnacle of the strong who may rule the world.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Titan, due to the holy element he inherently possesses, has yet to show any unique character of a demon lord. But he is also a rather intriguing individual who possesses extraordinary power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ancient vampire is cunning and loves to come up with deviant ideas/</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the current generation of it doesn&rsquo;t seem as powerful as before, but perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sixth seat is a special case.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has undeniable strength, but he seems to have very little interest in the current life.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why he enjoys sloth. He has everything to become a king, yet he still leads a lifestyle of sloth.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are in total six persons including Guy, apart from the Titan and the fairy, the remaining four all have awakened.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are all survivors of several Tenma Great War, their abilities have undergone countless trials and prevailed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like Guy and Milim, it shouldn&rsquo;t be any surprise if they have obtained some ultimate skills.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from that, there&rsquo;s also Guy&rsquo;s friend Leon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon was originally a human and a &#12300;Chosen Hero&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Due to encountering some special circumstances, he obtained his ultimate skill.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s a strong man even recognized by Guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, there are seven persons in total.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">I wonder, how many people would be able to be an equal to all seven of them during this Walpurgis Banquet.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Guy smiles joyfully having stumbled on the thought.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This fool tried to control Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What an absolute joke, it&rsquo;s hard enough for one to even try to hide from laughing at it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His goal is nothing but a lunatic&rsquo;s raving.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mere Clayman couldn&rsquo;t possibly be able to achieve something even Guy can&rsquo;t do.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who possess ultimate skills cannot be affected by low level skills.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this world;s rule, only those who&rsquo;ve obtained &#12300;Unique Skills&#12301;could resist against the strong control of magic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They should still be subjected to elemental attacks that could target their weakness. But speaking of that, there&rsquo;s no way mind control would ever work. Whoever&rsquo;s mind is so fragile that can be manipulated with such skill could never obtain ultimate skills.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultimate skills, as they&rsquo;re called, are devices to grant access to the ultimate principles of this world.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why, in order to combat against an ultimate skill, one must employ ultimate skill as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is simply how this world works.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman can&rsquo;t even touch Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That would mean, everything has been under Milim&rsquo;s control.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">What an absolute fool&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy shows a small smile and decide to observe how things go in silent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The time when the weak can pose as demon lords is finally over.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The imposters shall be eliminated while the real Demon Lords assume rule.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy, gives off a big pretty smile as he believes the arrival of the day is imminent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Afterward, the Walpurgis Banquet filled with climaxes unveils itself.</span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>

		<p class="c11 c10"><span class="c4 c21">Place of destiny</span></p>
		<hr>
		<p class="c11 c10 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since we&rsquo;ve prepared ourselves, I give orders to Veldora while waiting for people to take us to the venue.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am following Ramiris since I don&rsquo;t know the location of the Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of that, Ramiris seems to be unaware of its location as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I asked her why she doesn&rsquo;t know, she simply answered &#12300;Because I&rsquo;m escorted to the place every time!&#12301;. That&rsquo;s quite a telling answer.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since she always gets lost, so it became an unwritten rule to have someone to lead her every time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no use forcing someone who&rsquo;s not willing to memorize directions to memorize one.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They will likely send someone with a dimensional transportation ability here, so I&rsquo;ve decided to wait for their arrival as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It soon reached eleven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, but no one came to pick us up. Instead, I got contacted by Benimaru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What&rsquo;s wrong? Is there a problem?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I responded immediately and Benimaru begins to make a request in a calm tone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what he said.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our army has engaged the enemies and they&rsquo;ve now been informed of the enemy forces&rsquo; composition&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Due to my blessing, Benimaru has evolved to Youki</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c0">, a spiritual life form similar to a Dryad.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, Benimaru&rsquo;s power level could already rival the likes of Treyni-san.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna, Souei and Hakurou also became Youki and can be considered to be very high-level species as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is great, but the problem lies with the new skill Benimaru gained.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unique skill &#12300;Generalissimo&#12301;&mdash;&mdash; A very suitable skill for Benimaru&rsquo;s aggressive style. It is a skill specialized in controlling one&rsquo;s power output.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His power will not go out of control no matter how much strength he puts into it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The secret lies within &#12300;Prediction Analysis&#12301;, an ability which can completely analyze the flow of one&rsquo;s strength and remove inefficiencies from it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only is it a great skill for personal combat, it is also useful in leading army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By treating the army&rsquo;s movements as a flow of power, it can act as something similar to a predicting skill to determine the outcome of a situation. As soon as our army is in disadvantage, he can motion the army to alter the attack plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s is literally cheating.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The accuracy of communicated &nbsp;information is of the utmost importance on the battlefield, and yet Benimaru can effortlessly communicate with and command the entire army in the most optimum way.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Right now there are, along with the soldiers of the Beast Kingdom, a total of thirty thousand men in the united army under Benimaru&rsquo;s command. Benimaru can command the soldiers with the same precision as if they are his hands or arms, and lead the army of thirty-thousand units. It&rsquo;s normal that they seem to be behaving abnormally (with his command)</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additionally, Snique Skill &#12300;Generalissimo&#12301; also possesses the ability &#12300;Morale Boost&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After the massive enhancement in the precision of army commanding, each soldier&rsquo;s individual ability seems to have also been raised by around thirty percent. The overall strength of the army, consequently, is also increased by about thirty percent. The army is on par with the enemies in terms of number, and with the addition of superior soldiers, there is no reason why we would lose. With the adjustment of other skills, our chance of victory is even higher than before.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;All because Benimaru is in possession of such a powerful ability now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem that our army has secured the victory as soon as the battle starts.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why he came up with a new attack plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;It&rsquo;s just like this, we want to directly invade the enemy base. Souei is also tempted to try it out. Since we&rsquo;re all here, we should take down the suspected Clayman&rsquo;s castle in the fog bank as well.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru sure lives up to his reputation, What great confidence it is coming from him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But wouldn&rsquo;t that be too dangerous? The fight has just begun and victory is still not guaranteed&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No problem. I&rsquo;ve got it covered. Besides, the one in charge of attacking their base would be Souei and Hakurou&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Please wait a moment, Onii-sama!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Someone hacked into my &#12300;Telepathy Net&#12301;I was using to communicate with Benimaru&mdash;&mdash;It&rsquo;s Shuna who was serving me some tea.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, I didn&rsquo;t open this line to the public. And yet she broke in with such ease&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh, ohoh! What&rsquo;s wrong, Shuna?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like me, we both got a bit spooked. Benimaru&rsquo;s voice seemed to jump a couple of pitches up for a split second.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How dare you say what&rsquo;s wrong with me, Onii-san! Doesn&rsquo;t that Demon Lord Clayman possess dangerous power to manipulate people? What if Souei and Hakurou fall under his control&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, they will be fine&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No way! If you really insist on sending them, I want to participate in the battle as well!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oi oi oi! I thought that Shuna is the well-behaved, quiet type, so why is &nbsp;she making these kinds of demands now?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But my surprise was ignored as Benimaru continued to argue with Shuna.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brothers can never win in an argument against their sisters&mdash;&mdash;That is what a friend from my last life once told me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru is not as confident sounding as before, he can&rsquo;t win the argument and got pinned down by Shuna with her arguments.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s how it is, Rimuru-sama, please grant me permission to participate in the battle!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna proposes with smile all over her face.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm&mdash;&mdash;even if you say so&hellip;&hellip; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t want to send Shuna to such a dangerous place either, but she does have a point. It would indeed be problematic if Souei and the rest got manipulated.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case then should we not be trying to attack like this in the first place? However, it will certainly be the best opportunity to take the castle and prevent the enemy army from retreating back to their base. Indeed, the time that Clayman is absent for Walpurgis Banquet is our fated one and only chance.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, it should be okay as long as I prevent Clayman from escaping. I don&rsquo;t intend to kill all the Majins under Clayman&rsquo;s rule.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Rimuru-sama, please do not worry. I&rsquo;ll protect Shuna-sama&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I will also be there, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue exploring the enemy&rsquo;s base. But we do need to investigate whether Karion-sama is locked up in there.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei and Hakurou also joined our&#12300;Telepathy Net&#12301; to try and convince me. It seems Shuna have called them to play along with her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna is surprisingly stubborn and I really want to agree with her. Moreover, it is truly a concern whether Karion has been brought to Clayman&rsquo;s castle or not.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama, I am angry as well. I can&rsquo;t subdue my emotion to ever forgive what Clayman has done!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah&hellip;.. I totally get how you feel. Not only me, everyone has a grudge against him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I indeed understand how Shuna feels as she no longer wants to stay and wait in the town.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then we should have Shuna join the battle. But, Souei and Hakurou, you two must put Shuna&rsquo;s safety as the number one priority. Additionally, if the enemies&rsquo; combat abilities overpowers yours beyond expectation, you must prioritise you personal safety first and bring back such information. If you find Demon Lord Karion, do not engage unless it is safe. Do you all understand?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shuna is just so stubborn. But it would truly be a great help with your permission.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I have the teleportation skill, so it won&rsquo;t be a problem even in cases of emergency.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed. I am in fact much slower in terms of speed if we are to attempt an escape.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though Hakurou doesn&rsquo;t plan to escape, he still said that to help to smooth things out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We all have psyche attack resistance, so it should be sufficient to prevent us from falling into others&rsquo; control. Especially with Shuna-sama accompanying us, we would be further reassured in terms of that concern. As for Karion-sama, we will decide our plan if and when we actually find him.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei also interjects and adds, hoping to reassure me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, with Shuna&rsquo;s unique skill &#12300;Analyst&#12301;, they can analyze any attack against the psyche. Shuna can also use &#12300;Dimensional Movement&#12301;, so I may have been worrying too much. Despite Shuna&rsquo;s low magicule pool, her skills are all outstanding.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And just as Souei said regarding Karion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s possible that he may not be detained there anyway, so it&rsquo;s no use worrying over it now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve approved then, but you all must make sure to be vigilant of the situation and have your eyes wide open. For an extra layer of safety precautions, the time to commence this operation should be set after the start of the Walpurgis Banquet, that is after twelve o&rsquo;clock, midnight.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;Understood!&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, Shuna, Souei and Hakurou will be exploring Clayman&rsquo;s base soon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s almost twelve o&rsquo;clock midnight soon, I begin to ask Veldora about the Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;m not interested in those nobodies.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he said that, Veldora still shared his knowledge on the subject.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon is the only one who became a Demon Lord after Veldora was sealed. This means I can collect information regarding the rest of the Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Many Demon Lords seemed to have fought against Veldora due to him causing havoc around the world.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Around two thousand years ago, he once destroyed the city of vampire. He was pursued by the pissed off vampires. And its story seems to be quite interesting&hellip;.. It seems that one of them was a slim and beautiful female vampire whose power is far beyond the rest of her race. These vampires later disappear without a trace, and even Veldora doesn&rsquo;t seem to know of their whereabout.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What&rsquo;s her name now&hellip;...was it Ru..Lulus? No, or it should be Milus, right? (D: The name is still wrong btw) Anyhow, though I didn&rsquo;t give it my all, she&rsquo;s still not some simpleton to have been able to play a round with me, so you&rsquo;ve got to be careful!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora says that vampire doesn&rsquo;t have a sense of humor, but, he&rsquo;s probably the one at fault.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course she would get pissed seeing her own country getting destroyed and burning to ashes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyone would get pissed by it, even I would have lashed out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;s a long time ago, so I&rsquo;m not sure about that now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, about that, now a man called Valentine has become the Demon Lord!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris shouts, who has been listening to Veldora recalling ancient tales.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems the exchange of power took place around fifteen thousands years ago. Hopefully the hatred against Veldora held by the vampire race has died off.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Titan race Demon Lord also seemed to be a strong opponent against Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve fought several times without a definitive winner.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No wonder why Veldora has his name memorized, he sounds like a super duper extrememo bananaz fighter (D: Anymore adjective, Gavin?). If he was able to fight against Veldora, it means he has already possesses power to rival a &#12300;True Dragon&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is very high leveled even for Demon Lord standards.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lastly it&rsquo;s the Demon race.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seems to have beaten up the demons several times. But even with their bodies destroyed, they would resurrect after a period of time. They seem to be a group of very interesting opponents.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they even grew stronger over time, which gave Veldora a fun play thing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, he didn&rsquo;t seem to have fought against the king of the demon race.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His castle is rumored to be located on the permanently frozen land of the northern continent. The place is too cold to habitable, which is why Veldora never visited.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora glossed over this part saying: &#12300;Anyhow, that type of wasteland is not worth my visit! Gahahahaha!&#12301; as he laughs.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Something must have happened, but no matter how I inquire, he just won&rsquo;t tell me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there really isn&rsquo;t a need to go out of your way to visit that kind of place, so I won&rsquo;t follow it up</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right, because Guy is very strong. Guy, Milim and I are all ancient Demon Lords!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as Ramiris said that, I begin to feel that there is nothing great about them. Unbelievable. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, that won&rsquo;t matter for now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm, so that&rsquo;s about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How many Demon Lords are left?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve encountered&mdash;&mdash;Milim, Ramiris and Karion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve just heard about Valentine, Dagruel and Guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to Phobio, there is also Frey who backstabbed Karion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Putting Leon aside first, the enemy this time is Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So is there still one more person?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehhh&mdash;&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The self proclaimed knowledgeable Veldora sure is unreliable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, you mean Dino. The Demon Lord who&rsquo;s lazier than me!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Ramiris seems to have a comrade.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Not comrade at all!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I ignore her angry shout. That makes up ten in total.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora has provoked some Demon Lords in the past, so I have to be careful in how I interact with them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, the Demon Lords seem to be more powerful than I imagined.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not fair to use a brat like Ramiris as a standard.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s probably more appropriate to have Milim as the standard. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even with my evolution now, I still wouldn&rsquo;t have much chance against Milim in battle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve spared against her several times by now, but in none of our matches did MIlim show her true power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Insufficient information.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can stand a chance if Milim is participating in a training with me, but I&rsquo;d better not get over myself not knowing how she is when she gets serious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, it is still unbelievable that Milim would agree to wage a crusade on me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There must be someone behind this&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim shouldn&rsquo;t be so naive as to allow herself be manipulated like this. She isn&rsquo;t communicate with that many people in the first place, moreover, her personality doesn&rsquo;t seem like the kind to betray others.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All I can think of it&rsquo;s that Milim has done this because of some unknown reason.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, it&rsquo;s no use thinking about this now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll decide after I meet her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we continued to chat, I sudden feel a distortion in the space dimension before me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem our guide arrived.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A bizarre door appears before my eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The door looks extremely extravagant as if someone is trying to show off intentionally. I could probably learn this given I could manipulate space directly. I think if I come up with a design like this, I could open the portal faster and proceed with &#12300;Transportation&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A green-hair beauty in dark red maid suit walked through as the door is open.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then she bows towards Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve come to escort you Ramiris-sama. Is this the one you&rsquo;ve mentioned about? If you don&rsquo;t mind, please come along with us too.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As she finishes, she steps back to stand near the door and lowers her eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She seems to have killed her sense of self and behaves like a professional with thorough education and training.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, there is one thing I had on my mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This maid gives off an oppressive feeling similar to Diablo.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is a Demon, and a highly ranked one among the race.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Normally Demons have an upper limit at the rank of Greater Demon General no matter how long they&rsquo;ve lived. In order to evolve further, certain things are necessary&hellip;&hellip;. In the case of Diablo, it is me giving him a &#12300;Name&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With name acquired, Diablo was able to break through the limit of Demon race and evolved from a Greater Demon General to a Demon Noble.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Kufufufufu. I&rsquo;m not interesting in becoming stronger. But right now that I am aware that there are people stronger than me. I should give it some effort in the future then.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is not interested in becoming stronger but is instead interested in fighting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Combat is simply meaningless if I get too strong, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve enjoyed my evolution cap&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s how he put it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Was he joking?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s true, then he sure is horrifying.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And right now the Demon maid that stands in front of me is the same as Diablo&mdash;&mdash;That is, a Demon Noble.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Rather than a maid, she is more like a messenger from hell</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to knowledge (anime that I&rsquo;ve watched) from my past life, maid is also a battle-oriented class. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also, allow me re-emphasize, she is a Demon Noble.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This woman is obviously a dangerous opponent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, it&rsquo;s Misery. Long time no see! How&rsquo;s Guy?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind despite the other side being a dangerous Demoness.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In some way, this fella is not some simpleton as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;how would someone as humble as me dare to worry about my master&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, yeah. You are still the same. Never mind.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said, Ramiris flaps her wings and flies to the door.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We followed as well. If we are to be left here, we won&rsquo;t know where the exact location of the Banquet is.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we are to hesitate now after solidifying our resolve, I would be too embarrassed to see Benimaru and the rest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And about this maid&mdash;&mdash;Misery, she seems to be Demon Lord Guy&rsquo;s subordinate.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I recall that he is the king of the Demons, and one of the ancient Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he&rsquo;s able to tame even Demon Noble, he is guaranteed to be strong. I&rsquo;d better not antagonize him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;But, it will still depend.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And speaking of which, Misery who&rsquo;s already overpowered is supposed to lead way for other&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem that Guy is quite the arrogant man.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I here thought that the only ones who I should be vigilant against are the Demon Lords, I think I was being too naive.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I had known this, maybe I would have brought Diablo. But if I did, there may be a solid chance of him rampaging with Shion&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those two are on bad terms and it&rsquo;s no use thinking about it now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s time to show my resolve.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dominators of this world is waiting ahead.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, I am not afraid.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is because&mdash;&mdash;I have become one of those people who are the strongest in this world.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I made up my mind and walk past the door.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru smiles looking at the situation on the battlefield.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything is going according to his plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemies have been baited into the traps set by Geld.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that is only natural. Since the enemies were totally underestimating them during combat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Sasuga Rimuru-sama, your plan is so perfect that our defeat here seems impossible.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru said to himself while pitying the enemies. Benimaru doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s anything since he&rsquo;s only able to execute on the strategy because he is able to control the army to his will.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like Benimaru said, Clayman&rsquo;s army seem to firmly believe that they have the advantage because of their numbers, which led them to underestimate us and fell into the traps. The fast-moving Beastmen soldiers who were disguising themselves as refugees being pursued lured them near the traps.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;The victory is within our grasp. As it stands now, it&rsquo;s impossible for the enemies pull a reversal.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru is observing the battle while floating in mid air when Alvis suddenly flew up next to him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She tapped the wings on his back, and giving it extra thought as to not break Benimaru&rsquo;s concentration.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I see it is Alvis-san, sorry if you&rsquo;ve heard me boasting without victory, how embarrassing.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Please just call me Alvis, Benimaru-sama&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon hearing this, Benimaru turn his scarlet red eyes towards Alvis.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are not my subordinate.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru refuses coldly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;indeed, you have a point. But, right now you are the commander giving orders of us Beastmen.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">as such, Benimaru nods.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Very well, then for this battle only, I shall appoint you as adjutant.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I accept your order, Benimaru-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The authority to command the united army belongs to Benimaru. And as of this moment, the person in charge of leading the army of Beast Kingdom Yuurazania, Alvis, proclaims her allegiance to Benimaru, which makes Benimaru the Generalissimo of this united army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The words of the Generalissimo cannot be doubted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The pursuit of the strong, that is the rule of the </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;I&rsquo;ve appointed you as adjutant, but right now there is not much work to do. I won&rsquo;t get careless, but, all these operations are to ensure our victory.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed, I think so too. However, there are still several strong opponents left on the battlefield.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, once we have the situation under control, I&rsquo;ll send in Geld and the rest.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru answers without hesitation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Please hold on. We also want to help in regards to that mission!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed. I hope you won&rsquo;t take away our glory, Generalissimo. This is after all the kingdom of the beastmen. Karion-sama would scold us if we just leave everything to you guys.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes! Since you all have even take on the task of confirming Karion-sama&rsquo;s whereabout, I hope we will at least get to fight this battle.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia and Phobio interrupt, become increasingly more excited. Alvis gives off a wry smile seeing how this is and says:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Benimaru-sama, we will leave the task of commanding the army to you, but please order us to take the heads of enemy generals!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon saying so, the Beastketeers bows with respect.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru smacks his lip with a &#12300;Ze&#12301; sound.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So you guys made me the Generalissimo because of this, right?!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ara, what do you mean by that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing Benimaru is losing his temper, Alvis begins to persuades him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At last Benimaru&rsquo;s willing to compromise.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright. I was planning to have you guys join in the fight anyway, so no problem. But, you must retreat immediately if you feel uncertain about your victory. Some very dangerous individuals seem to be lurking in the enemies&rsquo; troop.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He speaks permitting the actions of Alvis and the rest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a matter of fact, the combat abilities of several enemies are still unknown. There may be difficult fights once they encounter these individuals.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">It won&rsquo;t matter since I&rsquo;m here. As long as I can sense if someone is in a tough fight, we won&rsquo;t lose.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru smiles fearlessly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Beastketeers also begin to selecting their prey. They are sharpening their claws with their proud animal instinct in order to eliminate the barbaric intruders.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The traps would be activated in just a few minutes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis waits patiently for the moment to arrive. Suddenly she thought of a question and asks:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;There is one thing I need ask. What do we do with those who run into the traps?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We kill them all, is what I wish to say&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru got stuck there and gave it an extra thought.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But we will leave the decision of killing or not to you Beastmen.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;And what do you mean by that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We will capture those who don&rsquo;t plan on resisting. Although Rimuru may look it based on how he acts but he is in fact a kind hearted person who doesn&rsquo;t like to kill off other people. But with that being said, if there are casualties in our side, he would most definitely slaughter the enemies.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;....... I see. Then we will discuss the fate of the captives later.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, that would be fine. If it&rsquo;s Rimuru-sama, he may let those people serve time as worker.&#12301;(Sweat shop)</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Eh?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Aren&rsquo;t you guys going to rebuild the Beastmen cities? The more labor the better.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;To be able to think that far ahead&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru&rsquo;s random conclusion shocked Alvis.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only her, Phobio and Suphia are also very surprised.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They all thought that it is only natural for Rimuru&rsquo;s army to win, but the fact that he also made considerations for the aftermath truly surprised them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">He is so confident! Even when the enemies are all veterans under the cunning Demon Lord Clayman&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The more surprising fact is that his attack plan has taken the precautions to bring the enemies into captivity.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Given how war works in this world, it is much simpler to kill the enemies rather than pursuing and capturing them. The commander won&rsquo;t care for any surrenders when he can just use a large radius magical attack to wipe them all out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The captives are not captured because they happen to survive, instead they are captured as forced labor. This idea has never been seen in practice before. However, Benimaru and the rest seem to think this to be common sense and put it into practice.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This makes the Beastketeers feel extremely fearful.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would mean&mdash;&mdash;Majins under Rimuru don&rsquo;t think they would be defeated at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They must have enter the battlefield with the confidence that their army would win no matter what.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;However, it would be based on the condition that everything goes smoothly according to our attack plan.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru smiles and answers while the Beastketeers both respects and fear him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And soon, the fight broke out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Souei, engage according to the plan.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Understood, Benimaru-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soon after this brief conversation, the first casualty appeared within Clayman&rsquo;s army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems to be a named Majin who&rsquo;s leading several hundred other Majins. His died instantly at the scene as his magical core was pierced by Souka who suddenly emerged.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other four subordinates of Souei also simultaneously took the heads of the other captains under Clayman&rsquo;s army. Following Benimaru&rsquo;s instructions, they&rsquo;ve only assassinated opponents that they are confident enough to win against.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They followed through on Benimaru&rsquo;s instructed actions and achieved a one hundred percent precision.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the command chains of Clayman&rsquo;s army is now shattered to pieces, the officers&rsquo; order won&rsquo;t be able to reach the soldiers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s a trap! We&rsquo;ve been surrounded by the Beastmen!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No way, how could this&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Retreat! We have to retreat for now to reorganize our troop!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they discovered it too late.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Unlike human army, the </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;army often relies on personal performance, which is why a captain is needed. Now without the captions, Clayman&rsquo;s army has plunged into chaos.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Geld, you may begin.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Understood!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Benimaru&rsquo;s order, Geld begins to dispatch his commands.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Prepare to engage!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;Yes sir!&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next instant, the ground suddenly collapses onto itself, burying many soldiers from Clayman&rsquo;s army. This is because of the activation of earth manipulating skills. The seemingly natural and flat plain is in fact a temporary ground that was set up using skills with many traps hidden within. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The only ones who successfully escaped are the flying </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s. However these individuals with flying abilities couldn&rsquo;t escape either as they are soon taken down by the Bird-Type Beastmen troops and the&#12300;Hiryuu&#12301; led by Gabiru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now let&rsquo;s check on the ones who triggered the traps.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Rimuru&rsquo;s army has prepared large cave with quicksand</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;like soil at the bottom. This is non-lethal but would render anyone sinked into it unable to move below their waist. But with that being said, this is an army of </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s after all. Some people managed to escape using magic and other special abilities.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they struggle the strong kick aside the weak making them fall down to the bottom. The remainder now gather around the edges of the cave.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this is an important part of the plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru&rsquo;s army has intentionally allowed them up to make examples of them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the stronger ones in the army are killed without being able to defend themselves, reality of the situation would lay out the in front of the others. The weaker Majins would witness this and lose their morale. The survivors would understand the difference in power between the enemy and themselves, losing their last bit of strength to struggle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These nature of these traps are a stage set-up in order to successfully capture captives.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ten minutes passed after the fight began and the situation is one-sided. The enemy is unable to reverse the situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;T-to have gone to this extent&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Below them, Clayman&rsquo;s army with more than ten-thousand people are split off to chunks with countless fallen into traps. The Yellow Corps led by Geld are responsible for fortifying the edges of the caves. The members of the corp spread out in evenly around the traps to take care of any Majin that attempted climbed up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ones who are cut off can&rsquo;t fight against the many enemies above. Although the difference in power may be compensated by number and equipments.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the more powerful Majins have been taken out one by one at the hands of the Beastmen warriors and members of the &#12300;Kurenai&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is even more unfortunate that most of Clayman&rsquo;s army has attacked the plain with an open view. Even the remaining troops with around a thousand men awaiting order (cannot participate) won&rsquo;t be sufficient to reverse the situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We are guaranteed to win.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;S-sasuga&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru says naturally while Alvis expresses praise from her heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Heh, of course we will win. But we can&rsquo;t get careless now. I&rsquo;ll take care of the business at hand. Alvis and the Beastketeers, I permit you to roam freely and hunt down the enemy general!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for that order, Generalissimo! Then we shall be on our way!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We can finally put on a show. I&rsquo;ve caught scent of someone who once plotted against me so I&rsquo;m going after him.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then, I shall set out too. I&rsquo;ll leave the rest to you, Benimaru-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru doesn&rsquo;t even return a look and directly addressed the Beastketeers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Go on!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;Yes sir!&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, the Beastketeers begin to mobilize.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia crosses the skyline at incredible speed, so fast that it has already surpassed conventional flying methods.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Her skill &#12300;Shuttled Flight&#12301; could be only be wielded by very few competent </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s, yet Suphia, as a Beastman, is able to use it effortlessly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her target is the furthest line of the enemy force. That is where the non-military organization that has little to do with the frontline of the battlefield is located.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are the Worshiper of Dragons&mdash;&mdash;The Priest Warrior Order led by the High Priest Midley.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia hasn&rsquo;t discovered their true power, but her wild instinct told herself that these people are the strongest among the remaining forces.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, the leader of the flying soldiers greets Suphia.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s Gabiru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabiru, who is leading the hundred members of &#12300;Hiryuu&#12301;, decided to follow Suphia.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Gahahaha! I&rsquo;ve come at your aid, Suphia-san!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, it&rsquo;s Gabiru-san. Sorry, but I may have made a horrible decision choosing to pick a fight with these guys.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia responds, her bold smile only adds to her beautiful face. .</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHAHA, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. We&rsquo;ve cleared out all the enemies in the sky. Some Beastmen are capable of flying, so it would be rude if we continue to rob them of their duty. Moreover, since we are winning, aren&rsquo;t the enemies all fleeing?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ha! Our army is indeed winning. But just to be cautious to prevent the situation from being reversed, we&rsquo;ve got to suppressed the forces on the back.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I see, understood! You guys, be cautious!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes, boss!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We&rsquo;d say the same to Boss, don&rsquo;t get tilted.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing his subordinates&rsquo; teasing faces, Gabiru shouts at them in anger. This scene often plays out in life.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia smiles upon seeing such a scene. Her fighting spirits gradually grow high as she faces towards the enemy in front.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley has positioned his force in the safe zone behind the back</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They aren&rsquo;t exactly a military force, but instead they became part of the support team at the back. It would be more accurate to call them the medical squad that is operating away from the battlefield.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They didn&rsquo;t volunteer to enter the battlefield, but the notion of being looked down by others would make Midley too ashamed to see Milim again.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">If that&rsquo;s the case, even MIlim-sama would be looked down upon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley felt anxious about it and propose that they join the frontline as well. Yet Yamza rejected his proposal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s obvious that he does not care for Midley and his party, instead, he simply doesn&rsquo;t wish to share his victory with anyone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Surely the conquest this time would be successful.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemy is only one third of Yamza&rsquo;s army, a band of loose troops at that. There is no way they can launch a counter-attack while trying to protect the retreating refugees.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">It doesn&rsquo;t feel honorable to be fighting this type of opponents&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley changed his mind &nbsp;these few days went by.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the situation has took an unexpected turn.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Midley-sama, this is really bad&hellip;&hellip;. If we are to continue fighting, do we even have a chance to win?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Welp&hellip;.hmmm. Too weak, they are just too weak. So Demon Lord Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates are that weak&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No no no, it&rsquo;s not like that! The enemies have outsmarted us with tactics!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What! You idiot, if the enemy resorted to tactics, all we have to do it&rsquo;s to beat them with our true power! The only reason why you are saying these weak things is because you are still too inexperienced, Hermes!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve said already! It&rsquo;s a different case if we are talking about a duel, but when it is a wide-scale battle with armies, the tactics will determine the outcome of the battle! This include how to trick and outsmart the enemies. Our opponents have won this time. They&rsquo;ve been hiding their strength until key moments and have prepared traps.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh, no one needs you to explain that, anyone who&rsquo;s seen the battle would know!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley replies so while giving a snort of contempt.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is no good with brainwork. While in contrast, Hermes a little clever, that&rsquo;s why he often says things Midley finds hard to understand. Midley is quite upset about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, consider how things have developed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is on no grounds to argue back. Even Midley knows Hermes is right.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sight in front of them is the best proof of that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;More importantly, Midley-sama&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I know. Those people are closing in on us and they are strong. Even though I don&rsquo;t want to fight, we are on the battlefield after all. Since the enemies are heading for us, we will keep them &nbsp;occupied till the end.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So it really does turn out like this in the end. Understood&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley&rsquo;s spirit burns high as he glance at Hermes, who unwillingly accepted the reality .</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the corner of the battlefield, the back of Clayman&rsquo;s army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most intense fights of the battle is about to begin.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio lands on the ground and silently sprints through the field. He soon discovers the people hidden some distance away from the battlefield. Then he jumps in front of them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are the man with the angry jester mask and the girl with the tearing jester mask.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This bizarre duo is &mdash;&mdash; &#12300;Angry Clown (Angry Pierrot)&#12301; Footman, &#12300;Tearing Clown (Teardrop)&#12301; Tear.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are members of the Moderate Jester Association who are surveillancing the battlefield at Clayman&rsquo;s request.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hey, thanks for taking care me before.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio suppresses his anger and speaks up calmly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What&rsquo;s this? Isn&rsquo;t this Phobio-sama!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behind the angry jester masks, a pair of evil eyes are glowing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s Demon-Lord-wannabe Phobio-sama, lost-to-Milim Phobio-sama! Thanks for your help back then! &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The girl wearing tearing jester mask mocks at Phobio, looking down on him hard while greeting him while spinning and singing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hey, it&rsquo;s great that you both remember me. It would be really sad if you don&rsquo;t even know why you&rsquo;ll die at my hands!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eheheh? What are you angry at?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How strange. What is this baka angry at? That angry emotion smells very tasty, but it isn&rsquo;t enough reason to kill us.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, right!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Cut the nonsense! I may be an idiot for being tricked by others, but an idiot has an idiot&rsquo;s way. I don&rsquo;t need a reason to get my revenge!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a matter of dignity. Phobio unleashes his sharp claws.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those claws are so dark as to shine, and are also sharp and ferocious like wolfs&rsquo; teeth.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Tear and Footman didn&rsquo;t seem to react even seeing his claws.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh~Do you want to fight us? But you are so weak, better not get ahead of yourself!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;He&mdash;&mdash;hehehe. I&rsquo;m dying here, Tear. Phobio-sama come here specially to joke around, trying make us laugh.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two goes on with their chat, but that didn&rsquo;t lead Phobio to lose his cool.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He failed once because he was too easily angered. He&rsquo;s done more self reflection on the matter more than anyone and with much regrets.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So he begins his action at once as if announcing that greeting time is over.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He &nbsp;breaks into a run and closes in on the enemies at high speed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Oh!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ze!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Footman and Tear changes their attitudes now knowing words won&rsquo;t irritate him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides&mdash;&mdash;There has been an intervention.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the space begins to warp, a man shaped like a pig walks in from mid-air.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Long time no see, Footman. Do you remember me?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh? Oh my? What an honor it is to have the orc general arrive here. Wow, you&rsquo;ve really grown handsome!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Footman speaks with mockery, yet his expression is not as relaxed as his words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In contrast to how he looks, Footman is good at mind games.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Geld has seen through his true personality.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When his troops destroyed Benimaru and his companions&rsquo; hometown&mdash;&mdash;Tribe of Ogre, the one who accompanied them was Footman. Geld knew then already that he is not to be underestimated.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Footman is unlike any other normal Majin, Geld thinks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Plus that Tear is also present as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s around Footman&rsquo;s level. Since her true strength is unknown, this opponent cannot be underestimated .</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if the Beastketeer from Beast King Warrior Army,&#12300;Black Panther Tooth&#12301; Phobio, has very strong ability, he would still have a hard time dealing with both Footman and Tear alone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Hehe, as expected of Benimaru-san, these people are worthy of being my prey.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he thinks that, Geld is also extremely eager.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru learnt of the situation from above and ordered him to assist Phobio. Geld was originally frowning since the order required him to give up his commanding post on the battlefield, but only now did he realizes how accurate Benimaru&rsquo;s prediction was.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The outcome on that battlefield is already settled, even Geld&rsquo;s adjutant could handle things there. But in order to take on the duo from Moderating Jester Association, it would be a challenging task that only the veterans under Rimuru could handle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Allow me to assist you, Phobio-dono.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh oh, Geld-san. Thanks for the help!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio has also calmly judged the difference in strength between him and his opponents, that is likely why he didn&rsquo;t refuse Geld&rsquo;s proposition. He&rsquo;d rather put down his ego knowing what his limits are and choose &nbsp;the easiest path to win against his opponents.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, in the dark side of the small hill next to the battlefield, the two parties would soon engage in their battle&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon receiving reports coming from the battlefields, Yamza has lost his footing. The absolute advantage that his army possessed so far has all been an illusion created for the enemies&rsquo; trap.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza couldn&rsquo;t even imagine the prospect of his army being defeated.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman would definitely loses his nerve, Yamza must find a way to turn things around and win.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, it is an idiot&rsquo;s dream considering the what remains of his forces.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza hasn&rsquo;t lost his ability reason yet, so he can at least realize that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He begins to think about what remaining force he can utilize.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza the &#12300;Middle Finger&#12301; is the top lieutenant within Demon Lord Clayman&rsquo;s vanguards &#12300;Five Fingers&#12301;as well as the strongest Majin within Clayman&rsquo;s army. If anyone is to rival him, it would only be&#12300;Index Finger&#12301; Adalman and &#12300;Thumb&#12301; Nine-Head Beast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman is in charge of the defence force of Clayman&rsquo;s nation. He was an undead from the Great Jura Forest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">He seems to be a prominent clergyman when he&rsquo;s still alive, but it matters little in the afterlife. After being baptized with Clayman&rsquo;s curses and becoming a </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">, he received a significant increase in power and became an Undead King that commands many undead creatures.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His Holy power prior to his death has been turned into foul magic that curses the living&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Adalman has a weakness. His powerful body is accompanied by limited intelligence. That&rsquo;s why he would only follow Clayman&rsquo;s order&mdash;&mdash;Killing invaders. It is the reason why he did not join the battle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">The other one, Nine-Head Beast, is an extremely rare and high level </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&#12300;Youko&#12301;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span class="c0">. She&rsquo;s only three-hundred years old, relatively young for its race, and has only grown three tails. Yet her magicule reserves is far larger than Yamza, even rivalling Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now she is acting as Clayman&rsquo;s guard to attend the Walpurgis Banquet along his side. So she can&rsquo;t assist us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c5">&mdash;&mdash;Alas, I have to ask Adalman for help then.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the problem is&mdash;&mdash;How is he supposed to get Adalman here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, no. There is no way I can bring him here. If that&rsquo;s the case, I should lead the remaining soldiers and flee back to Demon Lord Milim&rsquo;s territory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that I&rsquo;ll call Adalman and rendezvous with him, then we will fight our way back&mdash;&mdash;That may be the best solution, Yamza thinks to himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A Walpurgis Banquet may last for a month at times, it&rsquo;s a long time. And if he handle the situation well, he might even be able to resolve it before Clayman returns.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not gonna be easy trying to order Adalman around, but he&rsquo;s got to take the first step even if it&rsquo;s hard.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter what, Yamza can&rsquo;t allow the situation to continue on and suffer a defeat, he would most definitely be punished if that&rsquo;s the case.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Clayman-sama is really scary and he would even go as far to get rid of me&hellip;&hellip;.. I&rsquo;d be lucky to survive, but I don&rsquo;t want to be mentally destroyed and manipulated as a puppet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Even though I don&rsquo;t want to admit it, but I&rsquo;ve lost this battle. However, I&rsquo;ll be the one that stands triumphant in the end.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With his plan settled, Yamza looks towards the battlefield.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There he witnesses an surprising sight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A beauty with black and golden hair is on the front, her face, beautiful and flirtatious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is approaching rather casually with golden khakkara in her hands as if she is entering a no man zone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 582.00px; height: 806.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image17.png" style="width: 582.00px; height: 806.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The top warriors of the Beast Kingdom surrounds around her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are the Beast King Warrior Group&mdash;&mdash;A group consisting of only several dozens people, yet the strength of the group is guaranteed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are warriors capable of fending off thousand by themselves.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Including the Elephant Beastman Zar, Bear Beastman Talos and more, they are not as strong as the Beastketeers, yet they are nonetheless powerful lieutenants who are worthy subordinates of the King of Beasts. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from these Beastmen, there is also a red-clothes group following them. They are casting powerful and deadly fire magic and has burnt the reserved forces awaiting at the back to a crisp.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These people are not worthy opponents to Yamza, but they are certainly better than his subordinates&mdash;&mdash;much stronger than those Majins. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Things just turn horrible.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Impossible&hellip;&hellip; What are the Beastketeers doing here? Did these people leave their army to assist here by themselves? But, even if that&rsquo;s the case&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza begins to panic upon seeing the appearance of these unexpected people.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Why are the enemy sending their strongest force into our camp&mdash;&mdash;? &nbsp;What the hell have the sentinels been up to&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The angry shouts of some of Yamza&rsquo;s lieutenants can be heard.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza is not the only one feeling overwhelmed by the situation, many high-level Majins at the scene also began to panic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Sorry to intrude but! We are unable to contact the sentinels, we suspect they&rsquo;ve been killed!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What did you say&mdash;&mdash;!!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza&rsquo;s lieutenants shout while Yamza remains speechless. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemy is moving too to respond to. By the time they realize the situation they&rsquo;ve fallen far behind the opposition almost to a fatal degree..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza completely loses his composure upon realizing this fact. Forget reorganizing and mounting a comeback, right now, just surviving and escaping challenging enough.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Not good, not good, not good, not good at all&mdash;&mdash;! At this rate, I would be lucky just to escape here alive!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza becomes anxious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a one thing to have a duel, but Yamza is not delusional and narcissistic enough to fight against that army and expect himself to emerge triumphant.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Buy me some time! I&rsquo;ll return to our country and bring Adalman. He would be able to summon the undead here and help our army regroup.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are all excuses. Yamza knows he&rsquo;ll lose, so he has made his decision to escape with all his might. Luckily Yamza pledged his loyalty to Clayman voluntarily, so he won&rsquo;t end up killed by contract (curse) unlike the rest of the Five Finger.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Continuing to follow Clayman is no difference from suicide. Yamza made that decision and drew his line of loyalty.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes sir!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We will try our best to hold out for three more hours!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His lieutenants replied one by one with resolve written on their faces. Yet Yamza&rsquo;s decision remains unchanged.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He only has only one thought&mdash;&mdash;These people are all idiots.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza decides to directly initiate teleportation magic&mdash;&mdash;But as soon as he tries to cast the magic, he discovers something is wrong.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;unable to activate? Is this&hellip;&hellip;&#12302;Dimensional Lock-down&#12303;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, it&rsquo;s all too late now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza and his men notices Alvis, who&rsquo;s also looking back at them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is through Alvis&rsquo; skill&mdash;&mdash; &#12300;Eyes of Heavenly Snake&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It may only be an extra skill, but it is able to induce all types of negative status on enemies&mdash;&mdash;paralysis, poison, madness etc.&mdash;&mdash;It also has a horrifyingly wide area of effect, and one would be affected by the skill as soon as Alvis spots them. No one can escape it unless they could resist or endure the effects. it is an extraordinary skill.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, Alvis holds another trump card.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is, her unique skill &#12300;Suppressor&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a dimensional skill with the effect of Thought Acceleration&#12301;, &#12300;Dimensional Manipulation&#12301;, &#12300;Dimensional Transportation&#12301;. It can pose as an obstacle to the enemies&rsquo; movements in order to create situations that favours of her allies.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once seen by Alvis, the regular soldiers under Yamza are all paralyzed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The weaker willed ones will go mad instantly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even ones with some capabilities couldn&rsquo;t escape it either, they either have their bodies paralyzed or are poisoned to death. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some even got petrified. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are only less than a hundred men who escaped the fate. Alvis didn&rsquo;t give a fighting chance to the unworthy opponents before the actual fight even began.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza&rsquo;s magic was neutralized with Alvis&rsquo; &#12300;Dimensional Manipulation&#12301;, It is not a disruption to the magic he casted, but instead, she locked down the coordinates of the space around Yamza so as to prevent him from altering his nearby space using magic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why no one could escape through magic in this surrounding area. The so called &ldquo;surrounding area&rdquo; refers to the area within Alvis&rsquo; eyesights. All of the surrounding battlefield is now under Alvis&rsquo; control.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what the Beastketeer&mdash;&mdash; &#12300;Golden Snake Horn&#12301; Alvis is capable of.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unable to escape, Yamza grinds his teeth hard as he realize his situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he has kept a trick up his sleeve.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, that is a forbidden technique that Yamza wishes to avoid using.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, he must engage the enemy in order to survive.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;It can&rsquo;t be helped. I guess I&rsquo;ll get serious with you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh oh, Yamza-sama!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;If Yamza-sama is to get serious, even the three Beastketeers won&rsquo;t stand a chance against him!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We&rsquo;ll fight to the end! Now it&rsquo;s our time to shine and carry out Clayman-sama&rsquo;s will!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The subordinates regained some morale.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What a bunch of idiots, Yamza ponders to himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demon Lord Clayman only wants to profit from their victory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To suffer so many losses on top of losing the war, Clayman surely will not let Yamza and his men walk free.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">That man only believes in power&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how loyal is Yamza, Clayman would never recognize him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would only treat him as a useful pawn and a competent subordinate to adore.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is even the case with the Special Frost Magic Sword that Clayman gifted to Yamza. His intent is to make Yamza stronger.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, Clayman does everything for himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even so, Yamza still respects Clayman. His sharing of wealth with Yamza benefits him too as they both stand to profit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Yamza doesn&rsquo;t intend to sacrifice his life for Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &#65288;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">&hellip;&hellip;.It&rsquo;s about time. I will survive and rise up again someday!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would go into hiding after meeting his waterloo.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said given his strength as a Special A ranked Greater Majin, other Demon Lords would definitely be willing to take him in&mdash;&mdash;Yamza thinks so to himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Interesting. Alvis, Majin of the Beast King, fierce Beastketeer, do you wish to fight me one on one me?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He fires off a strong force of will towards Alvis.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He makes his bet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He will defeat the strongest opponent Alvis to sink the enemies&rsquo; morale. He may even be able to reverse the situation by doing so. But even if that doesn&rsquo;t pan out, he could still create the opportunity he needs to escape himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Sure, no problem. Strongest fighter of Demon Lord Clayman&rsquo;s &#12300;Five Fingers&#12301;, Yamza-dono. Let&rsquo;s find out our difference in strength!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This can also illustrate the difference in character between Clayman and Karion-sama&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s the other reason why Alvis accepted his invitation</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She uses &#12300;Dimensional Transportation&#12301; to move towards Yamza. The surviving Clayman&rsquo;s soldiers thrust towards her. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is not even worthy of being called a tactic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beastmen are simple creature, once provoked they would fight to the death. Yamza tried to exploit such nature and planned out this despicable trickery.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as they try to exhaust Alvis&rsquo; stamina, Yamza would have a easier time winning. His subordinates launched their attack based on that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Fool, there&rsquo;s no use in using such dirty tricks on me!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis shouts in response and activates her &#12300;Eyes of Heavenly Snake&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But for Yamza, that was all he needed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The moment Alvis activates her skill was also the chance of winning that Yamza&rsquo;s been waiting for.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Diiiie!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He suddenly moves towards his enemy and swings his sword towards Alvis&rsquo; back, where she neglected to defend.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the sword swings closer and closer to Alvis&rsquo; back&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Nice thinking! You don&rsquo;t deserve to be a man by using such despicable trickery! &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man who shouted that jumps out of Alvis&rsquo; shadow and deflected Yamza&rsquo;s sword. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Heh, who are you?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I am Gobuta! I&rsquo;ve been hiding inside (the shadow) in case of emergency.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Gobuta was explaining, more people gradually jump out of the shadow.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is obvious now that they are the Goblin Rider units who now moved on all fours after &#12300;Union&#12301;. By utilizing their high mobility, they scattered to engage the several Majins around who are still able to move.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ara, you&rsquo;ve even kept me in the dark. No wonder I&rsquo;ve been feeling something weird this whole time.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite Alvis saying that, she has in reality noticed them long ago. That&rsquo;s why she reassuringly walked into the enemies alone, knowing someone got her back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Heh heh, we&rsquo;ve been sent by Benimaru-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobuta casually replies to Alvis while secretly pointing and activating his sheath railgun at Yamza. He has realized the difference in power between the him and Yamza, and that he is no match for Yamza when he deflected Yamza&rsquo;s sword, That&rsquo;s why he determined that this is a great opportunity to strike when Yamza is still keeping his distance and weary of his kodachi.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Gobuta has the phrase &ldquo;Fair and Just&rdquo; in his dictionary, but his understanding is a bit different than what common sense would dictate in that it is something to demand from the opponent but not something he would give.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobuta fires his sneak attack but was deflected by Yamza&rsquo;s sword.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Trash! Get out of my way!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza points the tip of his sword at Gobuta and casts his magic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza launches the Great Magic Water Ice Canon at Gobuta, while Gobuta launches the same thing back at him using his kodachi.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobuta did not launch the attack as a counter but rather as a followup to his initial sneak attack. But the magic saved Gobuta&rsquo;s life as the two canon beam collides with each other mid-air and fizzles out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;huh, how could that be as powerful as my magic sword? And even without chanting? How can a lowly trash be so arrogant&hellip;... &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From that point onward, Yamza begins to treat Gobuta as an enemy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Gobuta is out of tricks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Oh no, his reaction was so fast I didn&#39;t even catch up with it. I was saved because he happened to launch that magic too. If I was stabbed I would be dead by now. I guess it&rsquo;s time for my escape!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are his real thoughts.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thankfully the Goblin Rider units have made some progress, that&rsquo;s retreating now won&rsquo;t net him a bad reputation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hence Gobuta decides to retreat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then let&rsquo;s retrea&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as he was just about to give out the order, Yamza&rsquo;s sword was thrusted above Gobuta nose tip.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;KYAAAA!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But lady luck has smiled on him once more, as Gobuta narrowly avoided death once again due to him having an unstable and tilted posture.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, this made Yamza&rsquo;s more wary of Gobuta.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Did he seriously just dodge three of my attacks?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">It can&rsquo;t be a coincidence if he can do it three times in a roll. Yamza concludes. After all, his super-sonic attack has indicated this sigh&mdash;&mdash;The Hobgoblin in front him is no ordinary </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehehe, it seems that the Beastketeer has also fallen so low to be sneaking in reinforcement in a duel.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza shouts out with bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is also one of his tricks. Now not only the Beastketeer, some unknown individual has come to interfere, he thinks it would be too dangerous to deal with them both.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobuta on the other hand is thrilled at the situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">This is great! Now I don&rsquo;t need to fight this dangerous Majin anymore!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He hides his joy and takes action swiftly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then I shall be the referee of this duel.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobuta proclaims.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now he&rsquo;s just a referee.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s better off this way as he would just be a hindrance out there.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru allows them to fail but dying in battle is strictly forbidden. But Gobuta is not that dumb, not dumb enough to become the first one to die for such a dishonorable cause.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ara, I ok with leaving him for you to fight!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis intentionally teased, but Gobuta rejects it with ease.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How could you let others have your prey, that would tarnish the good name of the Beastmens! So I won&rsquo;t fight over him with you, please do what you wish! Sorry for the interrupting.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The luckiest thing of all is, Gobuta&rsquo;s bizarre responses actually worked.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Yamza</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is able to avoid the unknown danger.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis wasn&rsquo;t planning on giving up on her prey anyway.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for Gobuta&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">AHH&mdash;&mdash;YEAH! Now my mission is complete!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He got to escape from having to fight the super strong opponent not to mention that it&rsquo;s a fight &nbsp;he had no chance of winning.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the back of the enemy force, the end of the battlefield.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Priests Warriors led by High Priest Midley are engaging in an intense battle against the &#12300;Hiryuu&#12301; led by Gabiru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said however, there are only a few people who remain standing on the battlefield.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two hundred people from both side in total are almost all lying on the ground now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Among them, Midley didn&rsquo;t receive a single scratch.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even his white tidily worn vestment is without a single dirt stain. He also claims to be extremely lively.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WH&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;HAHAHA! You guys really are something. As expected from the children of dragon!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley laughs delightfully.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was focusing his eyes on the people lying on the ground while ignoring the Suphia panting heavily in front of him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t just treat me like air!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia activated &#12300;Transformation&#12301;(Beastilization) and entered a state of half human half beast. Her improved bodily function now rivals Midley. However, her intention has been seen through by Midley as he begins to dodge sideways to keep his distant.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia missed her chance to strike and left herself exposed with openings all over her body, giving the Midley tho perfect chance to strike.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eat this!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He grabs her sharp clawed hands that was coming for him while tripping her feet and carries Suphia over his shoulder&mdash;&mdash;then with a quick and hard throw, thrusted her towards the ground.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a lot like a Judo throw, it is the unique throwing technique passed down by generations within the Worshippers of Dragon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;I wasn&rsquo;t treating you like air. After all, I don&rsquo;t get much chances to use this technique on </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">, so I&rsquo;m quite fond of it as well. I have not met a worthy opponent like you to throw for a long time.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; (ara ara, muggy was here)</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley says so with joy, but Suphia, who just got thrown by other couldn&rsquo;t bear her anger.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Woo, damniit! H-How dare you do this to me&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her opponent is clearly treating her like a play thing. Suphia&rsquo;s face reddened out of the humiliation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she has to admit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man standing in front of her named Midley is strong beyond her imagination.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the party in question Midley begins to ignore Suphia again and starts to glance around. He&rsquo;s waiting for Suphia to get back on her feet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Damnit, he&rsquo;s totally ignoring me! And my &#12300;Automatic Regeneration&#12301;for some reason is not activating......</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, Suphia has not sustained any damage to her body, that&rsquo;s why the healing skill is not activated. The reason why she feel exhausted is simply the draining of her stamina.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One&rsquo;s body would feel exhausted by the impact force after being thrown on the ground by others. There is no damage to the outside, yet it would traumatize the body&rsquo;s interior.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Suphia stands up again.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is the Beastketeer&mdash;&mdash;&#12300;White Tiger Fang&#12301; Suphia, and she won&rsquo;t allow her enemy to give her a one-sided beatdown.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I can&rsquo;t believe someone like you serve under Clayman. I thought Yamza was the strongest, and my instinct is always quite on point. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yamza&hellip;.. You mean Yamza-dono. That man is quite good himself, but not enough to be toyed by me. I may look the way I look, but I have Milim-sama as my sparring opponent.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Milim&hellip;...Demon Lord Milim? That would mean, you guys are the Worshipers of Dragon!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No wonder they are so strong, Suphia thinks to herself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These people would seem too out of place if they are indeed Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They took great joy in battle and won&rsquo;t hesitate at all in killing. But most importantly, their power is much higher than the other Majins.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh? That Dragonoid has beaten Hermes! WHAHAHAHA, that&rsquo;s really something!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley laughs out delightfully as usual.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes&rsquo; opponent is Gabiru, and just now, he got beaten the crap out of him by Gabiru&rsquo;s spear.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh, Midley-sama. Stop laughing, give me a hand already!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Idiot! You are the one who has lost. You better reflect yourself while staying there.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes is lying on the ground while trying to beg Midley for help. Midley instead laughed it off.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He probably has seen through that Hermes was holding back and that Gabiru didn&rsquo;t plan to kill Hermes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Very well, now there are only three of us in total including me. You&rsquo;ve proven the skills of your soldiers by fighting to a draw with my warriors. It means that they have thoroughly trained their bodies and souls instead of relying on their skills.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I should be the delighted one bearing your compliments. I am Gabiru. And you are Milim-sama&rsquo;s&hellip;&hellip;.?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm! I am the Worshiper of Dragon, Midley.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I am Suphia. Beastketeer Suphia! I won&rsquo;t bother giving my name to Clayman&rsquo;s subordinate. But it&rsquo;s a different case of Milim-sama&rsquo;s subordinate.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, Suphia-san, right? I&rsquo;ll remember that. Now then, what to do, what to do? Should I take on both of you now?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he says so, Midley crosses his hands casually.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His actions says much about his confidence that he won&rsquo;t lose even against them both.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Could I ask a question before we fight?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh, what&rsquo;s wrong?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Nothing in particular, but how could a mere human be so strong? Or should I say, are Worshipers of Dragon really human? There&rsquo;s definitely something strange about this.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Having been asked by Suphia, Midley also nods intriguingly in response.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then he makes his response:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;The human you say&mdash;&mdash;That is the issue. If you are raising a question regarding our race, then the answer is very simple. We are the same as Gabiru-san over there. We are all Dragonoids.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley proclaims as if it&rsquo;s nothing of significance.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What!? You mean just like us?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, indeed. The difference is we didn&rsquo;t evolve from lizard man. We are the offsprings born through the merging of&#12300;Humanoid&#12301;Dragon and Humans. That&rsquo;s probably our difference.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, we are the same in nature&mdash;&mdash;Midley finishes his sentence with a smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So that&rsquo;s why&hellip;...speaking of that, my sister Souka also evolved to look like human.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No wonder, you guys are way too strong in terms of human standard&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That being the case, there are very few people left who can revert to our ancient appearance. None of my subordinates lying over there have gained any of those skills, such as &#12302;Dragonization&#12303; or &#12302;Dragon Warrior Transformation&#12303;. Nowadays, we are about the same as humans.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley looks at Suphia as he says so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;However, with this power inherited, we worship dragons to remind ourselves to not forget of the blood that runs in our body. Is that what you wish to know, Suphia-san?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Yes. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are human or </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">. I just want to know whether that toughness was trained and obtained by the weak humans, that&rsquo;s all. I should pay much respect to your efforts now that you mentioned you are no difference from humans.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHAHAHAHA, I hold the same thoughts. The so called strength is divided into innate and trained. A Majin is weak if he relies too much on his own innate strength and measuring the strength of others based on their magicule possession. Real strength cannot be seen with eyes. The difference in skillfulness is the only correct criteria. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see&mdash;&mdash;Suphia resonates such sentiment a lot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Suphia was born strong. Even without any effort, her combat abilities are stronger than most </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most Majin would stay away seeing her huge amount of magicules and the Youki surrounding her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Through her agility in battle, she utilize her strength to the fullest in order to get to where she is today.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now with Midley&rsquo;s words, she realize that she hasn&rsquo;t been practicing her skills for all these times.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;In other word, I can become stronger.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHAHAHAHA, indeed. The best way to get stronger is through actual combats. Go ahead, I&rsquo;ll be your opponent.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley stands looking calm as ever and says so while having his hands crossed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Should I join Suphia-san? Also, aren&rsquo;t you a bit narcissistic?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley gives off a smile as Gabiru says so, he then responses:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh! Young man, then I shall take down my hands and play with you two for a while!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since their opponent has come to this point, Gabiru would not stay silent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Suphia-san&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, let&rsquo;s go. But I assure you, this guys is strong!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that, Gabiru and Suphia challenge Midley.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fight between Alvis and Yamza becomes more and more intensifies, and the moment to determine the outcome has finally arrived.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the two in a stalemate, Yamza decides to use his trump card.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hahaha, as expected of the Beastketeer! It&rsquo;s no easy feet to fight me to a draw. However, victory is mine with this!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What are you talking about?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehe, did you really think this magic sword is my only trump card? You are good, and I&rsquo;ll admit that you are on par with me. But! What would happen when there are two me to fight you?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he finishes his sentence, Yamza releases the magic of his left wrist ring.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This wrist ring is the &#12300;Clone Wrist Ring&#12301;. It possesses the magic to spawn an exact replica of the user, it is a reputable and valuable treasure of a magical item.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Including gears, even the skills of the clone would be exactly the same as the summoner. In other words, Alvis must confront two Yamza at the same time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the clone could rival the summoner, the situation is highly disadvantageous for Alvis. However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How about it? I would consider sparing you if you surrender now&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So what?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;What?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Do you think you can beat me with such dirty trick? I see that the Majin serving Clayman is indeed just this low, what a crude ace.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis doesn&rsquo;t seem to be moved and even mocks at Yamza.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Prepare to die then!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet Yamza couldn&rsquo;t finish his shout as Alvis reveals shows her trump card.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her upper body resembles a beautiful female while her lower body is that of a dark serpent. That is Alvis&rsquo; real appearance. &#12300;Beastilization&#12301; has revealed Alvis&rsquo; natural appearance and granted her immense strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A lot of people think unlike Phobio or Suphia who are good at close-quarter combat, Alvis is the long range mage-type fighter skilled in casting magic attack from a distance.But it is the furthest from reality. She lives up to her name as the subordinate of Beast King and is most talented in close-quarter combat, a natural warrior.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said, her fighting style differs a lot with the other two.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis raises her golden khakkhara above her head. The khakkhara disappears instantly as Golden horns appear on Alvis&rsquo; forehead.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her suppressed Youki bursts out to the surrounding, indicating her immense growth in strength. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A double stage &#12300;Transformation&#12301;&mdash;&mdash; That is Alvis&rsquo; trump card.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With dragon scale armor covered all over her, Alvis stands before Yamza.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &#36825;&#19968;&#24102;&#30340;&#31354;&#38388;&#23436;&#20840;&#34987;&#38463;&#23572;&#27604;&#24605;&#25903;&#37197;&#65292;&#28385;&#28322;&#30340;&#22934;&#27668;&#24320;&#22987;&#21457;&#20986;&#32043;&#33394;&#30005;&#20809;&#12290;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The space around the surrounding is now under Alvis&rsquo; complete control, her overflowing Youki begins to appear as purple lightning.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobuta shouts in fear.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now Alvis doesn&rsquo;t seem to be differentiating friends and foes, so he feels he&rsquo;s in a life threatening situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are Gobuta, right? I&rsquo;ll grant you the permission to leave here at once.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ll run even without your permission.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone retreats! Gobuta orders everyone and begins to flee with the Goblin Slayer units.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Idiot, do you want to take on us alone?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;She&rsquo;s looking down on us!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The surviving Greater Majins begins to shout and surround Alvis.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Alvis, who has revealed her true self, doesn&rsquo;t seem to give a single care.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;AHAHAHAHAHA! Then die, you fools!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was too late when Yamza comes back to his senses.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some Majins have collapse with blood pouring out of their mouths.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some Majins are petrified entirely and breaking into pieces.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rest of the Majins&rsquo; bodies begin to corrode and were turned into dust on the spot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The difference in power is simply too large. Yamza&rsquo;s subordinates are all being consumed by negative effects, dying off one by one. Yamza couldn&rsquo;t do a thing to stop this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;B-bastard&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Combating in close quarter with her special method, that&rsquo;s Alvis&rsquo; most skilled fighting style.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Golden Snake Horn&#12301;&mdash;&mdash; Alvis&rsquo; Golden horns symbolize death. No living beings within this area could survive.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza finally realizes he has been completely defeated. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Surrender now. I&rsquo;ll have you as captive and allow you to live if you surrender.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis proposes. He may only survive by accepting her conditions. That&rsquo;s because, his &#12300;Clone Wrist Ring&#12301; has been broken the moment Alvis&rsquo; &#12300;Eyes of Heavenly Snake&#12301; &nbsp;laid on it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems to also be able to destroy equipment, and Yamza&rsquo;s clone vanishes before the fight even started.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">&mdash;&mdash;My hands and feet are also paralyzed. If this is to continue, I&rsquo;ll even have trouble fighting&hellip;&hellip; How in the world is the Beastketeer this strong?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza was unlucky, since Alvis is the strongest Beastketeer among the three.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has picked the wrong opponent. But he&rsquo;s not aware of it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis is often entrusted the role as commander, so she rarely utilizes her power. That&rsquo;s why to the outside world, even though she is the head of the Beastketeers, she&rsquo;s still often underestimated/</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza is one of them, looking down on Alvis from his heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The outcome has been determined. However, it is not over yet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is a cunning Demon Lord that will never allow his subordinates to betray&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I just need to accept her proposition. Yamza makes up his mind&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;How would I ever allow you to do that?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman&rsquo;s voice begins to echo in Yamza&rsquo;s heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza exclaims out of surprise.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His body begins to act on its own without his control.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;S-stop! Please don&rsquo;t do this, Clayman-sama!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamza takes out a ominus dark purple orb and bring it to his mouth.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wu-Gu!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He grinds his teeth tight, trying to avoid getting near that object, but&hellip;..These are futile resistances.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman has inserted skill &#12300;Puppeteer&#12301; in him, so Yamza&rsquo;s body is not following his command.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;What are you doing?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis is confused as Yamza is being forced to swallow that object.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To swallow the dark purple orb&mdash;&mdash;Fragment of Charybdis.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ha? Ha-pu, wugugu&hellip;&hellip;.GWHAAAAAAAAA&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What is going on?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The confused Alvis has her nerve tightened.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In front of her, Yamza&mdash;&mdash;his tentacles begin to reach out towards the corpses surrounding him as his body begins to expand into something abominable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Having been affected by the dimensions filled with magicules under Alvis&rsquo; control, Yamza&rsquo;s magicule storage begins to expand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There begins a blizzard of ice snows.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As it consumes and expands, and explodes in the end.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">It is a consuming-type </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;that lacks the &#12300;Core&#12301; of a </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and would disappear after its rampage.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though it could only last for a while, its power is compatible to the one it originates from. That&rsquo;s likely the most challenging part that it&rsquo;s this character. Its appetite to consume is endless just like its originator (Yamza).</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is the forbidden technique Yamza didn&rsquo;t want to use, a clever trap set by Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Charybdis is reborn to this land.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis&rsquo; nerves are extremely tense as she attacks Charybdis with all she can.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet she couldn&rsquo;t harm it. Charybdis continues to expand, and her normal attacks won&rsquo;t even leave a scratch on it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most challenging part is no more than &#12300;Super Regeneration&#12301;. It would absorb the corpses around it to regenerate temporary flesh.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehhh, you monster!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis shouts with hatred, as her proud skill &#12300;Eyes of Heavenly Snake&#12301; won&rsquo;t work on it and her purple lightning has a weak effect.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Regarding that, this monster is already Calamity-level, a </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with many levels higher than herself. Even if Alvis is the strongest among the three Beastketeers, she won&rsquo;t be able to take on it by herself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thankfully there is still quite the distance from where she is and the battlefield. Alvis wants to buy some time so it won&rsquo;t affect her companions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, that is at most until Charybdis completes creating its body.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Its horrifying collective body in the form of desperation now rampages this land.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, this monster isn&rsquo;t satisfied with consuming Yamza, it even swallowed the Magic Frost Sword in order to search for its &#12300;Core&#12301;. It is thus drawing in heat from the surrounding and causing a temperature drop.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The monster is turning its Youki into a Giant Water Ice Storm and causing a havoc there.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The way the Ice Storm swallows and harms the surrounding people and objects indeed is horrifying to watch.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">More severely, what concerns Alvis is what would happen the moment it releases all the heat it absorbed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">It&rsquo;s fine for those who can escape with teleportation skill, but as for those without it&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone would die.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Damnit! That bastard Clayman&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis shows her true character as she shouts and continuously launches attack on the enemy without interval.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She launch it so frequently to the point of not sparing a single breath.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of these efforts have been futile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Charybdis has only sustained some flesh wound, the damage to its core is less than significant.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, it&rsquo;s because it is regenerating too fast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Blasted! I&rsquo;ll have to let those who can run retreat first&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In time of desperate, Alvis tries to come up with a best solution to her situation. She was going to request Benimaru to issue the order for fast retreat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In terms of result, the order was not issued.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s because&mdash;&mdash;there is no such need.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You&rsquo;ve disobeyed me, Alvis. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to retreat if you can&rsquo;t win?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that said, Generalissimo Benimaru suddenly appears before Alvis.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Benimaru-sama!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, Charybdis. I couldn&rsquo;t harm it last time, but what about this time?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru shows an arrogant smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Benimaru-sama, this monster is too&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I know. It&rsquo;s quite impressive, now I could use it to test out my strength.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he says so, Benimaru raises his right hand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, he gains control of everything.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has analyzed thoroughly between the capability of Charybdis and himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This battle could now end in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru holds his footing tight and unsheath his tachi covered in black flame to slash against Charybdis. However, his strength wasn&rsquo;t enough to cut through the Giant body that Charybdis has built so far.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there is one big difference from before.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike Alvis&rsquo; attack, its wound did not regenerate.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Charybdis has taken the burning damage of &#12300;Black Flame&#12301; from the knife and it seems to be burning it to ashes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ze, I&rsquo;m still not good enough it seems. No time to toy with you then, I&rsquo;ll send you straight to hell.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru says so as she walks in front of Alvis.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With his tachi carried on his shoulder, he isn&rsquo;t even considering Charybdis as a threat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;My apologies, I was playing to have some fun with you when you complete your body&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It hasn&rsquo;t flown to the sky, yet its gigantic body is almost forty meters long. Yet right now this gigantic being is being covered up by a black hemisphere.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Begone.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru whispers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In an instant&mdash;&mdash;with a &ldquo;BOOM!&rdquo; sound, its noise spread across the surrounding.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s the large area burning attack &mdash;&mdash; &#12300;Black Flame Hell&#12301;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Its power cannot be compared to that of the past.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition to Benimaru&rsquo;s &#12300;Fire Manipulation&#12301;, his magicule movement is completely within his control. Even with Charybdis&rsquo; innate skill &#12300;Magic Interference&#12301;, its body is still burnt to ashes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus it shows how much more stronger has Benimaru&rsquo;s control of magicule is compared to the Charybdis.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;There&rsquo;s no way!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis is justified be so surprised.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru&rsquo;s attack is able to harm Charybdis, which indicates his magicule possession is superior than it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That means&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru is already able to rival the master of Alvis and the her companions, that is Demon Lord Karion, Rank Calamity.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alvis, I still have something to do. Right now, I order you to command the army as an adjutant.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Understood, Benimaru-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis deactivates her &#12300;Transformation&#12301; and receives her order while kneeling.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She has a lot of questions on her mind, but it is the wrong time to ask. She has hidden her inner shocks to take on the order with pleasure.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The calamity Charybdis that appeared on this land&mdash;&mdash;was taken care of before it could destroy a thing. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;He, hehehe&hellip;.. What a surprise. I know Yamza would betray, but I can&rsquo;t believe Charybdis was handled that easily but someone&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right. Talk about everything having its own vanquisher, even us won&rsquo;t be able to kill it.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Clayman&rsquo;s army has been routed. The mission is a failure and he&rsquo;s suffered heavy losses this time. He should have listened to that lord and stay put as he&rsquo;s ordered.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right. Even Laplace went to persuade him, it&rsquo;s all Clayman&rsquo;s fault this time.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Footman and Tear exchanges looks and chit chats with each other.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio, who&rsquo;s been devastated in the fight, is still waiting in front of the two alongside Geld who&rsquo;s come to protect him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We&rsquo;ve got to report to that lord now, playtime is over.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Footman didn&rsquo;t get a scratch while Tear sustained some injuries that wouldn&rsquo;t have affected combat either way.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If in terms of damages they sustained, Geld and Phobio is on the losing side.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t try to escape. I know you guys are good. But I just need stall you until Alvis and Suphia arrive. As well as with Benimaru-san, you guys are dead meat.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio raises his body while shaking, announcing these to them. His wounds just now have all been healed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the level of regenerative power akin to &#12300;Super Regeneration&#12301; that can easily outrank the &#12300;Automatic Regeneration&#12301; unique to the Beastmen. After all, Phobio was once consumed by Charybdis, he has inherited some of its power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are really annoying, little black kitty!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tear shouts as she sends Phobio flying in a hit. But it was not lethal, and Phobio was able to regenerates and stands back up instantly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tear has the upper hand in terms of speed, but she&rsquo;s unable to deliver a fatal blow to Phobio. On the other hand, despite Phobio is covered in wounds, none of which are severe.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This duel seems to look as though Phobio has lost, but with each minute passing, there may be a very different result in the end.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for Footman and Geld,</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Footman would squeeze himself into a giant meatball and smash towards Geld with high spinning speed. Geld would then fended himself with his giant shield and launch a intense counterattack in between the interval. However, all of these attacks have been stopped by Footman&rsquo;s meat armor and thus not sufficient to cause any lethal wounds.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two side continues this cycle of attack and defense, both seem on part with the opponent. That is how their duels are going.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, that is because Footman is not treating it seriously.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just now Charybdis was just defeated, and Footman has lost his interest because of that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Woo!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing he has gotten serious, Geld immediately shows up before Phobio to defend him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What&rsquo;s wrong, Geld-san?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He couldn&rsquo;t answer Phobio&rsquo;s question before Footman attacks towards Geld and him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a Giant Magic Missile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a solid hit that didn&rsquo;t have much change to its shape, yet its power was enough to change the terrain of the surrounding.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld&rsquo;s giant shield is destroyed by the missile. Not only so, his full body armors are also broken into pieces.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio, even with Geld&rsquo;s shielding sustained some damage. He got to survive thanks to &#12300;Super Regeneration.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;He&mdash;&mdash;Hehehe. Taking care of you guys aren&rsquo;t part of my contract, so I&rsquo;ll let you walk this time.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Be grateful! You guys would be dead long ago if we got serious!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld and Phobio have sustained heavy injuries that they are unable to stand. These are the words heard by them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the dust of the explosion dissipates, there is no sign of Footman and Tear.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;That was a terrible loss. Even though I&rsquo;ve gained new power through it, there is still many that are stronger than me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, had Geld-san not come, I would have long been dead. Sorry, I&rsquo;ve dragged you back&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;There is no such thing. We&rsquo;ve lost indeed, but we are still alive. Let&rsquo;s just win our next fight.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld encourages Phobio like that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed, you are right!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio is no amateur.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s just that Footman and Tear are too strong. With that power, it won&rsquo;t be strange if people call them Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From magicule possession alone, it would seem that Geld is superior. But the cunningness of the opponents have greatly masked the difference between their skill.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Geld fought Footman, he has taken a defense stance all along. With that being said, he knew that he won&rsquo;t be able to win even with all he&rsquo;s got put into the fight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the result is exactly as he intended.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Benimaru-san, the clowns have escaped.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld reports to Benimaru using &#12300;Telepathy Net&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, I saw. And they thought they&rsquo;ve had mercy on us, how naive.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld received order from Benimaru to find out what the opponents are capable of.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition he needed to protect Phobio.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">I was just here to observe the situation&mdash;&mdash;Even though I can&rsquo;t say it was that easy. But, it is their biggest failure that they&rsquo;ve not killed me. Benimaru-sama would also keep an record of my fights. In other words, we can give it to Rimuru-sama for analysis. Then their powers and secrets would be exposed to everyone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is why their defeat was not meaningless.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has accomplished his goals. There is no need to worry about winning at the moment, he can always train himself in the future to reduce their gap in strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld wanted to use his own men to fight to the death at this place of destiny, but unfortunately he is not strong enough.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">But, I will win next time!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He makes such resolve in heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then, I&rsquo;ll return to command the army.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Go ahead, there is still one more troublesome guy. I&rsquo;ll have him companied.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It ain&rsquo;t easy being a Generalissimo. Geld thinks to himself after the report.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are several hidden opponents that are really challenging.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They couldn&rsquo;t fight these individuals simultaneously, so they had to take the harder route in tactic in order to distract and spread these people.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the situation now, Benimaru would prioritize the sequence of aiding, but it may put others in danger if his judgements are wrong.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But with that being said, Benimaru has fulfilled his duty perfectly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was planning to go straight for Footman&rsquo;s head, but he&rsquo;s put aside his personal grudge to consider the victory of the whole army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">This Generalissimo doesn&rsquo;t seem so reckless in his decision-making. As compared to our initial battle with each other, he&rsquo;s grown a lot&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld feels much more respect and trust towards Benimaru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;The time rewinds a bit and we are again at the end of the battlefield.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two parties have only fought for a few minutes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This however, has been like forever to Gabiru and Suphia.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, this period has suddenly come to an end.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;This is&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hu&mdash;&mdash;hu&mdash;&mdash;W-What is&hellip;. Is happening&mdash;&mdash;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia has learnt how to buffer herself after being thrown the second and and third times, her tired body is also smoothened.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, Gabiru is not used to the attack. He has been tricked all over the place and exhausted as he swings around his spear.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley has been the two&rsquo;s opponents all this time. He doesn&rsquo;t seem tired at all, rather he looks very energetic. These two are a piece of cake compared to sparring with Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Midley is also the first to notice the situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Everyone, I approve you all of using healing magic! Get up! Come on, get everyone up right now!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He no longer looks as calm as he shouts out furiously.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;This is bad Midley-sama! From the reaction it seems to be quite the monstrosity.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I know! That is probably the Charybdis that Mililm-sama just defeated recently. No, or is it its remains?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It looks like so&hellip;&hellip; But it doesn&rsquo;t seem quite stable, even without our interference, it will probably disappear in about a day&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, this is the battlefield. It may have some unforeseen development if we are not cautious. We&rsquo;d better not feed anything to a monster like that.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley and Hermes who&rsquo;s been suddenly healed have entered their own worlds and converses all over the place.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Right now, the priests on the ground </span><span class="c4">begin</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to cast healing magic, not only on themselves, but also helping to heal Gabiru&rsquo;s subordinates from &#12300;Hiryuu&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Do you mean Charybdis? That monster that possessed baka Phobio! Didn&rsquo;t Demon Lord Milim destroy it already?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed, Charybdis has already been eliminated by Milim-sama&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia and Gabiru also join the discussion. They don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the right time to be stubborn about winning or losing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Calm down everyone. That isn&rsquo;t the real deal, more like the fragments of its power. And it seems to have used Yamza as substitute for its &#12302;Core&#12303;....&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley activates his &#12300;Dragon Eye&#12301; and begins to analyze the nature of the thing to explain to everyone. It is not as effective as Milim&rsquo;s &#12300;Dragon Eye&#12301;, but it is still a great skill with the abilities of &#12300;Vision&#12301; and &#12300;Analysis&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes is not just sitting around either, he&rsquo;s guarding the surrounding in case of emergency.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That should be it. I was planning to kill that bastard Yamza, but his soul has been eaten clean. With how things have developed, all we can do is try to reduce casualty and wait for it to die out by itself.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He concludes calmly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Have you guys heard what I said? I permit everyone to gear up to prepare for battle. But don&rsquo;t get greedy. We are just buying time to come up with a solution against it.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Let us help as well. We are much more skilled in high speed flying compared to last time. We won&rsquo;t get injured as long as we watch the scale attack.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley and Gabiru are like old friends. The two decides to collaborate with much tacit bonds. The mad Charybdis has one habit of chasing things that move. Gabiru&rsquo;s party can fly and is the best bait for it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia is also contemplating, her brain is running much faster than usual. She decides to do whatever she can and immediately takes actions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright, in order to prevent it from consuming any ground troops, I&rsquo;ll assist everyone to retreat&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she couldn&rsquo;t finish her sentence before things took a quick turn.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is when Benimaru happened to incinerate Charybdis.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wh&hellip;..What&hellip;..! That guy didn&rsquo;t even flinch while carrying out such spectacle!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;What the hell? Is that a Demon Lord? It would make sense if it&rsquo;s MIlim-sama, but how can a single Majin be capable of that? What a monster&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only two people saw it first-hand, Midley and Hermes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia, Gabiru also noticed the difference, but they are aware of the situation. All they knew was that the evil aura of the Charybdis dissipated instantly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;OI, what happened? Could you tell me as well!?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm. I was hoping you two would help explain to us.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;About that, I want to do it as well&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But it seems unnecessary.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes and Midley couldn&rsquo;t begin to explain before the space before Suphia and Gabiru begins to twist and till. A Majin with red hair, akin to burning fire appears before them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s Benimaru with his tachi on his shoulder.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru has come here to deal with the last dangerous individual on the battlefield&mdash;&mdash;Midley.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hey, it seems our men have been taken under your care.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru arrives to stare intensely at Midley, but he soon realizes things were amiss. There are traces of fights at the scene, yet there are no injured. The tension that was just about to break out now ceases to exist.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wait a second, Benimaru-sama! These people are Milim-sama&rsquo;s subordinates. The Priest Warrior from the Worshippers of Dragon.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What, Milim-sama&rsquo;s subordinates? That means&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Our wounds are healed by their healing magic too!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;........ I see. I suppose I&rsquo;ve thought too much. You&rsquo;ve really raised my alert high since you are the toughest opponent to deal with on this battlefield.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHAHAHAHA, you wasn&rsquo;t thinking it wrong. Our troop did fight yours. And it&rsquo;s also true that we&rsquo;ve healed your wounds, but that is for the coming battle against the bigger trouble. Right now there is no longer this necessity.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;I see. Then what should we do next? Do you wish to fight us?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;About that, what to do now&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We don&rsquo;t actually want to fight Milim-sama&rsquo;s subordinates either.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, that&rsquo;s right. Even though I want to have a spar with you, but it&rsquo;s not to antagonize you. But instead to see who&rsquo;s stronger in terms of strength.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So that&rsquo;s how it is, I understand your sentiments.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley and Benimaru both smiles as they finish their words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh, HOLD ON&mdash;&mdash;! This isn&rsquo;t appropriate!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, Benimaru-sama! If you harmed Milim-sama&rsquo;s subordinates, there is no guarantee how much hell she would rain on us!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right, Midley-sama! Rimuru-sama and Milim-sama are friends, it would lead to a catastrophe!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hermes and Gabiru moves out to stop the two, while Suphia who was trying to interject has to shut up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I know. Besides, if we really get serious in the fight, I&rsquo;ll most likely lose.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru decides to step up with the addition of &#12300;I don&rsquo;t plan to fight without the chance to win.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHAHAHAHA, nice saying. But if you are able to kill that Charybdis, even someone as strong as me wouldn&rsquo;t be absolutely sure in defending against your attack.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley follows it up with his laughter, with those words said, he seems confident in preventing benimaru from using the skills he used to win against Charybdis. It would definitely render the fight into a life-or-death brawl rather than a relaxing spar.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be too strange to spar on this battlefield, and besides, the incentive to fight against each other has long gone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On top of that, none of the side has the intention of doing the fight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that, at this location&mdash;&mdash;The battle that took place at the ruins of the Orc Kingdom Ocby concludes with the overwhelming victory of the united army.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from this, there is another battlefield out there, there also&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The time is midnight twelve o&rsquo;clock. Shuna, Souei and Hakurou begin their operation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Across the wetland masked by thick fog, there lies the Clayman&rsquo;s headquarter ahead. They intend to go there as they secretly intrude the wetland.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are many suspicious swamps in the wetland with sound of biogas popping off. These biogas seems to be the cause of the fogs, adding a sense of creepiness to its surrounding.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as they intrude into the wetland, a thick layer of mist begins to emerge in front their eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;This is not good. My &#12302;Magic Perception&#12303; has been affected by the fog.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed. This is the reason why I&rsquo;ve given up my investigation. My visions here are greatly limited and I could only rely on my five senses to collect intels. On the contrary, the enemies seem to be collecting intelligence using the fog.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So that&rsquo;s how it is, in other words, the situation is highly against us.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes. Hakurou-sama should be fine and I could also use skill &#12302;Stealth&#12303; to conceal my presence. However, Shuna-sama would&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Souei said, Hakurou could use his esoteric invisibility technique &#12300;Haziness&#12301; to completely hide his presence. Souei can also achieve perfect stealth that causing one unable to detect him even if he&rsquo;s right next to them. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ll be fine as well.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna is faced with the biggest challenge, but Souei&rsquo;s concerns seem to be unwarranted. Shuna also erases her traces and conceals her perfectly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, so it works just like my &#12302;Haziness&#12303;. It seems to be a combined skill of &#12302;Illusion Magic&#12303; and &#12302;Witchery&#12303;. As expected of Shuna-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hakurou is correct, that is the unique skill invented by Shuna. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although unable to rival Rimuru, Shuna can create unique magic through her unique skill &#12300;Creator&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;It seems that the issue has been resolved. But do still be cautious, as you can&rsquo;t use &#12302;Telepathy Net&#12303; as long as you remain in the sea of fog. The vision is not clear and communication is difficult, so you guys must be careful with every step you take</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span class="c0">. Also, here&rsquo;s something for you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this sea of fog, even with Souei&rsquo;s &#12300;Clone&#12301; to connect the them, they can&rsquo;t communicate through &#12300;Telepathy Net&#12301;. So Souei wants Hakurou and Shuna to hold on to &#12300;Sticky Steel Web&#12301; as method of emergency contact.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Through the vibration of the web, they can make some bare communication with each other. However, once the web is broken they will lose the method to contact, so they must be cautious with its usage. Shuna and Hakurou nod and carefully wrap the web around their wrists.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That concludes the preparation work.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Let&rsquo;s head out.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna launches the journey as the three begin to move out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;This is bad, we seem to have walked into a trap.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With only a few minutes set out, Shuna stops to say.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;A trap?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve also getting a mixed feel from the surrounding, almost as if there are presences of enemies&mdash;&mdash;What&rsquo;s that!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei couldn&rsquo;t finish his sentence when he senses an unknown and overwhelming aura suddenly surrounds him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I can&rsquo;t believe this&hellip;&hellip; They&rsquo;ve got many people, how could I have not sensed it, where have they been hiding?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, Hakurou! The enemies have not shown, but we have been lured to this location!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so, it must be this fog. Not only did this fog caused us to lose direction, it also hid our enemies&rsquo; presence and lured us into the center of this encirclement of trap&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So that is how it was, this is the reason why I&rsquo;ve been feeling strange from the start.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed, Souei, Hakurou. This fog has triggered &#12302;Dimensional Interference&#12303;. No matter where the enemies attack us from, it will always lead them back to a certain location&mdash;&mdash; &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Halfway through Shuna&rsquo;s explanation, someone has already rushed out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Souei and Hakurou are maintaining their guards against the concealed </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s near their surrounding and at the same time, displays a battle posture against the person that suddenly appeared.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna also remains silent as she looks at the person.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A skeleton wearing white clergy coat&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is the person who appeared before Shuna&rsquo;s party.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Such strong mana&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna whispers with cold sweat on her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She thought and panicked for a moment thinking that it was Clayman himself, but he quickly rejected that idea.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s already past midnight twelve o&rsquo;clock, Clayman has long set out for the Walpurgis Banquet. If that&rsquo;s the case, the logical deduction would be that this is one of the member of Clayman&rsquo;s close lieutenants, a member of the &#12300;Five Fingers&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now this individual not only can rival the strength of the Beastketeers, his power is closing in to that of Demon Lord. That is how much magicules this Majin possesses.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What&rsquo;s also unbelievable to Shuna is why such a person would want to work under others.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Shuna then recalls a thing that Myuran mentioned to her. The member of Clayman&rsquo;s &#12300;Five Fingers&#12301; who is responsible for defending the castle is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;I see, you must be Adalman. The ruler of this land&mdash;&mdash;The Undead King who leads many undead </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Hakurou, through his &#12300;Eyes of Heaven&#12301;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;also reached the same conclusion just as Shuna described.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman&rsquo;s immense and ominous power is far greater than what Myuran described. This is the Undead King who can rival a Demon Lord, he is the protector of this land.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei wouldn&rsquo;t doubt Shuna and Hakurou&rsquo;s, reaching the intended conclusion as it is meant to be reached. He concentrate his killing intent quietly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whoever this foe is, I&rsquo;ll kill him&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s the logic of Souei&rsquo;s action.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, Souei prepares for action.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed, I am Adalman. Guardian of this land and servant to the order of the great Demon Lord Clayman-sama. Lowly intruders, prepare to die. If you follow my order, I shall grant you all a painless death.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Undead King&mdash;&mdash;Adalman proclaims.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is an order from a king. Those words indicate that he is not considering enemies such as Shuna as an equal to him. But it is reasonable to be terrified at the hugh possession of magicules Adalman holds.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">It would seem that due to the presence of his seemingly infinite magicules, tens of thousands of undead </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s begin to emerge from the surrounding.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Godagodagodagoda, giligiligiligili *spooky skeleton sounds* they begin to make sharp noises as they surround Shuna&rsquo;s party.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So it&rsquo;s true, we&rsquo;ve been completely surrounded by the enemies. This fog is combined with &#12302;Coordination Barrier&#12303;, we can&rsquo;t use &#12302;Dimensional Transportation&#12303; to escape. All means of communication have been interfered, we can only break out of the encirclement by defeating Adalman.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna informs them without hesitation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Basically, Hakurou and Souei would never just take Adalman&rsquo;s suggestion without a fight. Hearing Shuna&rsquo;s suggestion, the two strike out together without a discussion. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No time to waste, let&rsquo;s take down the enemy general.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I agree. One it is struck by my techniques, even the dead can&rsquo;t escape their fate.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two make such response as they close in on Adalman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing the two striking towards him, Adalman gives off a disdaining smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehehe, a bunch of arrogant fools. How silly of me to have wished to offer you my mercy. Since you won&rsquo;t even be grateful to my proposition, I shall let you taste the consequences and regret your decision.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman swings his giant hand as if he still has much strength to spare.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Immediately afterward, something astounding occurs. Hakurou&rsquo;s knife closing in on the enemy was stopped by a knight in front of Adalman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hakurou deeply believed that that strike would have taken his enemy&rsquo;s life. He backs off while being shocked.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">That knight is a Rank A- </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">, Undead Knight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">However, that strike has had Hakurou discovered something amiss. Even if it&rsquo;s a powerful </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">, a single Undead Knight won&rsquo;t be able to stop Hakurou&rsquo;s knife.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are no common foe. Very well, I shall use my real skills to spar with you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hakurou was right.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has realized the strength of this Undead Knight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">It is not skills derived from the bodily strength of </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">, but from human skills gained through the hardship of training.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, it won&rsquo;t be the simple type to be seen through by &#12300;Eyes of Heaven&#12301;. That&rsquo;s why Hakurou has devoted himself to duel his Undead Knight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;............&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Undead Knight remains silent. He can&rsquo;t talk with hie temporary body made up of dead corpse.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, you can see the blue white flame shaking in its hollow eye sacks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is undoubtedly the light of will. They symbolize he has accepted Hakurou&rsquo;s invitation to duel in the name of honor as a human.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though he is no longer a human, the heart of that Undead Knight still belongs to an honorable knight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both sides have rivaling magicule stores as well as similar bodily strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With sparks from the clashes of techniques trained for years, the battle between two master swordsman begin.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from that, Souei has also encountered an opponent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was sneaking near Adalman before a giant shadow emerged before him to stop his attack.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ze!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei smacks his lip while staring at the gigantic shadow.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Could this be a Zombie Dragon</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;No, Souei! The enemy is not that simple! His magicule level alone is greater than you. It would be the strongest undead </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;here&mdash;&mdash;Undead Dragon!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fog has blocked Shuna&rsquo;s vision making her hard to do an accurate analysis of the enemies&rsquo; real identities.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After hearing so, Souei gives off a upset look. He could handle it if he&rsquo;s on his own, but right now the situation is highly disadvantageous as he is also trying to protect Shuna during his fight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The more dependable Hakurou is focusing on fighting the Undead Knight as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Souei must defeat the Undead Dragon as soon as possible. If not the tens of thousands of undead </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s from all around would devour them all, even Shuna would not be able to survive.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From Souei&rsquo;s point of view, he doesn&rsquo;t need to hold back under such circumstances.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Time to die! Web slash of ten thousand monsters</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span class="c0">!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He decides on the spot to give off all he has to attack.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His unique skill &#12300;Secret Inspector&#12301; grants him the effect of &#12300;One Hit Kill&#12301;by using tens of thousands of &#12300;Viscous Steel Web&#12301; to chop his enemies into pieces&mdash;&mdash;This is the ultimate killing move of Souei, like looking through sceneries of a kaleidoscope, where the flowers of fresh blood blooms. &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It won&rsquo;t matter even if the enemies are half spiritual life form such as undead. His technique can cut through and kill spiritual beings, so it should be the case that they are already dead.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How could this be, it is regenerating!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei begins to feel anxious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The twenty-something feet tall giant body has now been chopped into chunks, so his victory should have been guaranteed. Yet, the Undead Dragon revived itself as if it was nothing and restored its body.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s even faster than &#12300;Super Regeneration&#12301;, the power of so called &#12300;Undead&#12301;. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll destroy you along with your soul&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei makes up his resolve, yet Shuna&rsquo;s calm voice raises beside him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Calm down, Souei. Some as calm and analytic as you should know that you can&rsquo;t defeat the Undead Dragon, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;And the soul of that dragon seems to be in the body of that Majin Adalman. Don&rsquo;t worry about me, just focus on distracting the dragon. I&rsquo;ll take down Adalman.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna says so calmly to Souei.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;This is too dangerous!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, Souei. Right now I am angry.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A cold smile hangs on Shuna&rsquo;s face as she expresses her dismissal of Souei&rsquo;s concern.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her eyes begin to glow brighter, showing her aggressive side. Seeing this, Souei lost his words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Shuna was once the female Miko responsible to rectify the Ogre tribes. Her words held a certain power that can cause others to follow her every order. Right now, her power has long surpassed the unique skill &#12300;Kyogenshi&#12301;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Speaker of mad words) of &#12300;Otherworlder&#12301; Kirara Mizutani. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, Shuna is not the type of person who needs protection.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei is well aware of that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then there could only be one answer.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Understood. I wish you emerge victorious, Shuna-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;The same goes for you, Souei. The dragon is all yours.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna smiles as she says so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei nods towards her and returns his focus on the Undead Dragon. Since he&rsquo;s taken the task, he won&rsquo;t hesitate anyone. Souei is confident in Shuna and dives into his own battlefield.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna is alone now, but she&rsquo;s not anxious nor panicked as she confronts Adalman directly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman seems to look down on her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh? What do you plan to do, young lady? What can you do without your guards? And how do you plan to take on this ten-thousand strong troop?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman&rsquo;s voice reflects a level of unbelieving accompanied by a sense of joy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Adalman is enjoying himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The order of Demon Lord Clayman cannot be disobeyed, but Adelman&#39;s own will still remains, only his actions are restrained.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliminating invaders&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s the only thing Adalman can do.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All powerful but with an empty head&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s how Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates always mock him. This is only so because Adalman has been bonded by the land and unable to move freely.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman won&rsquo;t even give him a chance to argue back, it&rsquo;s no wonder why everyone does not know about this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not accurate to call Adalman a Majin, he is more akin to a weapon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is the defense mechanism bonded to this land to protect the castle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His soul however is not restrained, but his actions are all scripted orders that would automatically be executed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he claims to pledge his loyalty to Clayman, but it&rsquo;s all but an act. This mechanism has long been designed to express respect towards its master. And Adalman has long desired to get rid out of such chain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Adalman is enjoying his time talking to Shuna.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would always automatically carry out the mission to protect the castle regardless of the situation. However, Adalman is not restrained from talking to the invaders, which is one of his source of joy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is perhaps a twisted form of mercy from the craftsman of this mechanism&mdash;&mdash;Demon Lord Kazaream.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps that is not the truth, however, Adalman has decided to explain it in that direction. After all, with this tip bit of mercy, Adalman was able to remain sane and endure for &nbsp;thousands years.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">I do appreciate him for crafting this mechanism in order to prolong its durability.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman believes so deep down his heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is for this reason he is able to give everything he has to defeat the invaders when he&rsquo;s body is no longer retrained.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon imagining the scene of more than ten thousand undead Mamonas plunging at Shuna, he prays to himself that she won&rsquo;t suffer too much pain in her death&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about that. &#12302;Anti-Monster-Attribute Barrier&#12303;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna&rsquo;s firm voice echos.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that instant, the circle with one-hundred-feet long radius centered around Shuna suddenly becomes a holy ground that would prevent the invasion of any evil monsters.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a barrier that will respond to magicule matters. She &#12300;Analyze&#12301; and &#12300;Fuse&#12301; her &#12300;Magic Nullified Domain&#12301; and &#12300;Holy Purification Barrier&#12301;. With previous experience of their usage, Shuna developed this original spell by herself. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time he has barricaded against all magicule. It also has very powerful Magical defense that could choose one of the four elements such as fire and wind to defend against.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Now then, we won&rsquo;t have any other people to interfere. If I can beat you, I would be able to destroy the defense mechanism that is using you as its core.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Oh, impressive. You&rsquo;ve discovered my secret. Little girl, what is your name?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, just as what Shuna said.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once Adalman is eliminated, the defense mechanics of the castle would also be destroyed. The key point of the mechanics lies on the fact that Adalman&rsquo;s soul has been bonded to the terrain, which has enabled the perpetuation of powerful magicule energy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, then the Undead Dragon who admires Adalman, his close ally and friend Undead Knight would also be able to break free from this cursed bond.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna has seen through the truth in one glance and Adalman is impressed from the bottom of his heart. He also holds a shred of hope that his opponent may be able to assist them in escaping their suffering.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;My name is Shuna.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shuna, Shuna-san then. Let&rsquo;s have our battle. If you could beat me, I shall respect your will.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s quite the generous offer. However, we only want to destroy Demon Lord Clayman. If you stay out of my way I can spare you your life. You can also continue to stick around here if you want!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Heheh, but shouldn&rsquo;t you know that is simply impossible?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so? By the magnitude of your strength, you should be able to win against that cursed bond by yourself, but I may have been mistaken. &nbsp;It can&rsquo;t be helped then. I&rsquo;ll go according to the plan to defeat you. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna says so without hesitation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">If I could conquer this cursed bond, I would have done so long ago. Demon Lord Kazaream is a horrifying man who few could stand against him. HIs title &#12300;Curse King&#12301; did not come in vain. Yet you describe it like such an easy chore&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is how Adalman sees it, but even so, his mood did not get worse,</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then this would be the end of our conversation. Now, fight with everything you&rsquo;ve got!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battle ignites.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman was once a prince. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His hometown was on of the many province states under the rule of Holy Empire Ruberios.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These countries had no army. They relied on the Templar Knight Order sent out by the central Saints Church to protect their lands.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was at the cost of having to uphold the Rumina sect as their national religion and supply the knight order with both talented labor and monetary fund.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the time, the Western Saints Church were not as influential as it is now and the Holy Knight Order has yet to be formed. The ones excelled in the field would be rewarded the honorable knight title of the Templar Knight. It was a title that can not be passed on in generation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under such circumstance at the time, Adalman was one of these talented individual that was elected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His brother inherited the throne and gave birth to the new heir. Due to such condition, Adalman became more diligent in promoting the Ruminas sect.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He started his new career by joining the Western Saints Church that promote Ruminas sect.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman was charmed by the deity and believed Ruminas with all his heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruminas is the great god, and Adalman never once held doubt against his god.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why he obtained the archbishop skill &#12300;Miracle&#12301; and became one of the few master of &#12300;Holy Magic&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was able to climb to the highest position within the Western Saint Church and became a Cardinal Deacon, yet his position within the Holy Empire Ruberios was still not very high.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman continued to work even harder.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to get to a higher place of power, he didn&rsquo;t limit himself to &#12300;Holy Magic&#12301;, he even began to learn other magics. He often discussed, practiced magic with his friend then, Gedora (D: Remember this name, he&rsquo;d be back in 6 volumes kek), in hopes of becoming stronger.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">His hard work was finally rewards, as Adalman was able to become a &#12300;Sen&rsquo;nin&#12301;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sen&rsquo;nin refers to the spiritual life form that pushes human body to a similar state as the astral body of a greater spirit. These people are seen as humanity&rsquo;s guardian with much greater strength than ordinary humans.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">With this power in hand, Adalman was able to move up the ladder of power to assume the role of Cardinal Priest.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Time passed by fast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmen devoted himself into studying magic, and was one more step before reaching peak human performance and becoming &#12300;Saint&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet Adalamn encountered a joyful surprise then. Someone finally summoned him to the &#12300;Inner sanctum&#12301; on the Spirit Mountain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was really happy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Now I can finally meet Ruminas-sama!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, Adalman really did believe in the existence of the god Ruminas. After all, it is reasonable for him to think so given such fantasy is part of his faith.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the beginning of the end. The uninformed Adalman headed towards the Holy Land with great joy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet unknowing to him, his ardent heart had been betrayed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The intense magical battle entered a stalemate.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Melt them down, corrode all matters&mdash;&mdash;Corrosive Acid Magic Missile!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman chant and cast elemental-based magic &#12300;Corrosive Acid Magic Missile&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Many water balls begin to flow in midair and pour towards them the magic missiles that could corrode even bones. These water balls begin to shoot out Magic Acid MIssiles at Shuna like a storm of rain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet Shuna does not seem panic at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Magic Flame Wall.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The flame wall stopped all of the acid missiles and evaporated tham.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her thinking speed has been accelerated to a thousand times more alongside his highly accurate &#12300;Analysis&#12301;, and she is also capable of alter reality using her &#12300;Casting Rejection&#12301; and &#12300;Law Manipulation&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Very good, but how about this one! Oh cursed spirits, I grant thee thy live sacrifice&mdash;&mdash;Cursed Bond!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Undead magic&mdash;&mdash;A branch of spiritual magic, utilizes negative emotions of Demons and the Dead to activate. Among these magic, Cursed Bond is the most wicked. The magic would summon the dead to possess onto human, magic or any living beings to absorb their vitality.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this didn&rsquo;t work either.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Holy Blessing.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman heard Shuna&rsquo;s calm voice, and immediately after, he heard the familiar ring of the holy bell.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It alone could purify and grant salvation to the cursed dead.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 565.00px; height: 806.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 565.00px; height: 806.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Impossible! What is this, how can a </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;use &#12300;Holy Magic&#12301;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman&rsquo;s eyes are open wide as he witness this miracle. The beautiful way Shuna displays when casting reminds Adalman of his hard-working self as a youth.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Moreover, these Holy Magics are casted by a </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;girl. He&rsquo;s shocked to the point of shouting out his thoughts in front of such incredibly unbelievable reality.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna instead laughs in response. She is not obligated to answer, yet she still gives a detailed explanation to Adalman&rsquo;s doubt.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that really strange? You are too rigid in your thinking. &#12302;Holy Magic&#12303; is not a magic unique to humans. If you heart pray for the miracle with enough faith, it will become a reality!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most people believe that in order cast &#12300;Holy Magic&#12301;one must bond with the holy spirit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such view is correct in some level, but when viewed on a different spectrum, it would no longer be the case.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some Majins can use healing magic too&mdash;&mdash;This means apart from bonding with holy spirit, one has other channels to access &#12300;Holy Magic&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Yet most humans and </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s don&rsquo;t know about this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The power of faith&mdash;&mdash;in truth is the heart to believe in miracle is the key to learning &#12300;Holy Magic&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter the character of the wielder, one&rsquo;s firm faith would be transferred into power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is the secret truth behind this magic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, the Worshipers of Dragon could use &#12300;Holy Magic&#12301; because of their faith in MIlim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna explains calmly and told him everything she knew.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman is shocked upon hearing this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">I&mdash;&mdash;have I been mistaken? I&rsquo;ve been betrayed into losing faith in the god Ruminas. That&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t use &#12300;Holy Magic&#12301;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;anymore&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman was betrayed by Ruminas. To be more precise, he was played by the higher-ups of the Ruminas sect.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He never knew the reason, not even until now. Perhaps they did it in fear of Adalman would climb to a position too high, or based on some other reason.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the one thing he was sure is that the god Ruminas did not give him a helping hand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">It&rsquo;s quite funny when I think about it. I was deceived by the &#12300;Seven Celestial Saints&#12301;to contaminate the massive wave of undead causing calamity for the people&hellip;&hellip;. And it turned out to be a trap. I accepted Gedora&rsquo;s magic experiment then to have been revived in this twisted form.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Not knowing the other side intends to push him to the abyss of death, Adalman went to the edge of Great Jura Forest without any concern, the location where he resides today. There, massive amount of undead </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s and their Zombie Dragon leader awaited Adalman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman&rsquo;s close ally and friend&mdash;&mdash;Holy Templar Knight Albert fought with him alongside four other knights and an expedition army who all admired Adalman. Yet in the end they exhausted themselves in battle and died on this land.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman died once. But at the time, his other friend Gedora casted the secret technique of &#12300;Reincarnation&#12301; on him to successfully revive him. However, the foul spirits of the land corrupted him and the curse of the dead bonded him. The reincarnated Adalman did not turn into human, instead he became an undead that looks like a skeleton.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demon Lord Kazaream saw the talent of Adalman the undead, which is why he fell to where he is today.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That is why I believe, you are not my opponent as long as you can&rsquo;t use &#12302;Holy Magic&#12303;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna asserts herself with these words, Adalman thus realizes he&rsquo;s still in midst of battle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;H-how? How do you know I can use &#12302;Holy Magic&#12303;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman asks Shuna out of curiosity.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Shuna responded coldly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Because the way you look. You wear white holy rope that only a high position priest could wear. You are a high level mage qualified to wear it, yet you aren&rsquo;t even able to break this level of cursed bonds. Instead you complain it to your safe and act so soft of a man. You only wear this outfit out of your nostalgia for &#12302;Holy Magic&#12303;. I don&rsquo;t need to be cautious against opponent like you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her words were filled with disdain as if saying &#12300;Why do you still act all high and mighty at this point.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Ehh&hellip;.. How dare you say these nonsense when I remain silent.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman becomes furious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, he&rsquo;s not angry at Shuna but himself. His fury originates from his shock that someone suddenly pointed out his real thoughts that reflected how useless he has been.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, his dismay that lasted for thousand of years have finally been cleared up. He feel much joy and smooth within his body.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I pray to lord thy god. Grant me thy holy power and listen to my wishes&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the outburst of emotion, Adalman begins to chant.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">Indeed. It is because my resolve is not thorough enough. My companions who admire me were turned into undead </span><span class="c4 c8">monster</span><span class="c4 c8">s and I couldn&rsquo;t just leave them behind&hellip;.. It was I who was naive. &#12300;Undead Magic&#12301; and &#12300;Elemental-based Magic&#12301; couldn&rsquo;t purify undead </span><span class="c4 c8">monster</span><span class="c5 c4">s. But if I continue to pray in hope of casting &#12300;Holy Magic&#12301;, it may actually&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If anything, the reason why Adalman was trapped and bonded by this land was due to his companions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They died on this land and became the cursed dead. Adalman couldn&rsquo;t let him behind. This thought alone has bonded him with this terrain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now Adalman finally realizes how wrong he was.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He raises his two skeleton hands and draws out complicated spell patterns while reciting prayer to god.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are curse spells, the proof being the complicated geometric shapes that emerged before Adalman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Shuna, right? I don&rsquo;t hate you. Moreover, you&rsquo;ve helped me to clear up my mind. I very much appreciate that. However, I can&rsquo;t just commit suicide. So I&rsquo;m sorry that you&rsquo;ll have to come along with me to death&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman apologizes to Shuna in his heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are still many levels of highly imposing forces of Demon Lord Kazaream that bonds Adalman. That&rsquo;s why even suicide is not allowed. But with that being said, it&rsquo;s a different case to be killed by the remaining shock wave of the attack launched at the enemies.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He plans to kill Shuna as well as himself. In this way, his companions that have been affected by him could finally be set free&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As of now, many layers of magical circles gradually unfold around Shuna and Adalman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;I call forth the destruction of all beings! &#12302;Disintegration&#12303;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I was waiting for that! &#12302;Overdrive&#12303;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as Adalman cast his spell, Shuna utilized her unique skill &#12300;Analyzer&#12301; to carry out&#12300;Law Manipulation&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It resulted in the spirit particles gathered by Adalman to no longer be in his grasp and begins to go out of control.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;W-What? Your magicule possession is less than one tenth of me, yet you could overwrite my magic&mdash;&mdash;!!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magicule and Spiritual particles all operate based on magic. In terms of overdrive magic, there is no other explanation but that Shuna&rsquo;s magic ability is above that of Adalman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Adalman&rsquo;s view, Shuna has not been a worthy opponent at all. Now he realizes again that he has misjudged.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Very impressive. To reward you, I shall severe you cursed bond with this land!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">SHuna didn&rsquo;t listen to him till the end as overflowing light begins to consume Adalman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna has exploited Adulman&rsquo;s magic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When confronted with Adalman who is a much competent use of Holy Magic than her, he holds sufficient power to purify this entire land. Shuna didn&rsquo;t expect him to release the most powerful Holy Magic spell, but thankfully she knew the origin of that magic and overwrite it with ease.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">On this land, where that shine of light is omnipresent, it consumed all undead </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s including Adalman and purifies them&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hakurou and Souei come before Shuna.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh well, I was trying to get a result early, but that Undead Knight is surprisingly skillful. Shuna-sama has saved my life.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman was defeated and the land was purified. The Undead Knight devolved to a skeleton swordsman and was rendered incapable of moving. It would seem that the Undead Knight is under the order of Adalman to cease combating.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon seeing his look, Hakurou knew that his duel has concluded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a shame that he wasn&rsquo;t able to come to a result against an opponent, long awaited by him, who would require Hakurou to fight with his real abilities. But right now protecting Shuna is the more important thing. Hakurou knew the priority of things and immediately went back before Shuna.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, I&rsquo;m lucky that Hakurou is here. If it&rsquo;s me, I won&rsquo;t be able to defeat the Undead Knight. Souei as well, your opponent was an Undead Dragon yet you were able to win some time. Had that dragon been causing rampaged all over the place, we would not have been able to win this battle.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, I couldn&rsquo;t strike it down. I am deeply ashamed.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as Souei said, the Undead Dragon was a strong enemy. Its wounds would recover immediately if they are not deep enough. Once you come in contact with its Youki, your mind would also be contaminated.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei was only able to retreat with several &#12300;Clones&#12301; operated at the same time. He should be praised however that he was able to stall the Undead Dragon that he has no way of beating.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That Undead Dragon was also defeated after Adalman&rsquo;s fall. It maintained its shape through Adalman&rsquo;s magicule, and was no longer able to maintain its body afterward.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei personally couldn&rsquo;t accept the result, but surviving alone is a victory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the being said&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three look at each other awkwardly and sigh together.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Speaking of which, if that Adalman fought us seriously from the start, we would have been killed. I was so mad that I may have overdone things.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Adalman didn&rsquo;t intentionally hold back or play any dirty tricks. If he truly intended to Kill Shuna and the rest, there must be other available methods.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna saw through it and began he self-reflection.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right, we may have become boastful after gaining power.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed. Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s worries were warranted as he said that the situation of the battlefield may alter in an instant. I should have collected more intelligences.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three speak up and reflect for their arrogance.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But regardless, they were able to triumph.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman&rsquo;s headquarter has lost its key defending members.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, things are not done yet. Shuna and the rest still have work to do.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They must take down Clayman&rsquo;s castle and completely paralyze it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The majority of people remaining in the castle are non-combatants who aren&rsquo;t loyal to Clayman. These are sensible people who were hired by money and they don&rsquo;t intend to resist.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rest are mainly forced into bonds with Clayman due to all sorts of reasons. Shuna not only persuaded them, she also helped to release them for their curses. Only a while later were they able to take over the castle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Majins within the castle no longer posts a threat, Shuna&rsquo;s party then begin to explore.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve confirmed that Demon Lord Karion was not detained here. But the rest still wish to find evidence to get their hands on Clayman&rsquo;s weakness.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they are halfway through&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna and the rest were exploring around as someone approaches to speak with them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;please hold your step.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm? How is he still alive? Should we finish him?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hold up, Hakurou. This person no longer wishes to fight us.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The one came to talk was Adalman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hakurou, who doesn&rsquo;t dare to let down his guard was unsheathing his knife as Shuna stopped him calmly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shunan-sama&mdash;&mdash;Please allow us to call you so. Thanks to your magic, we were able to leave this land, receive purification and survive. I believe this is fate in working, so we have one request to as of you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a skeleton swordsman, Adalman, now an undead who has lost more than half of his power and kneeled and says.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;What is it?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna asks out of suspicion. It seems they have run into trouble again.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes, much appreciated. In fact I want to see the one who Shuna-sama has place her faith in. I&rsquo;ve lost my faith and my power will never reverse back to that of my prime. I no longer believe in the god Ruminas. That&rsquo;s why I now look for a new god to server.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;..............&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna and the rest were shocked and speechless.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Sh-should I call him god? I respect Rimuru-sama, but not to the point of serving as a god!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna makes her bare response, but Adalman doesn&rsquo;t mind. It won&rsquo;t pose a problem to him so he continues to recommend himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;His name is Rimuru-sama, is it? What a splendid name, perfect for my new god. We may be fragile Undead </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s, but we&rsquo;ll still be of use in some way. Shuna-sama, could you introduce and recommend us to Rimuru-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unconditional, undoubting faith seems very different from respect for someone&mdash;&mdash;Shuna was going to explain towards that end but gave up the thought seeing it may turn too troublesome.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">It&rsquo;s alright. When he sees Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s true identity, he may quit at the sight of the challenge.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon recalling how Rimuru&rsquo;s cute and soft look he usually displays, Shuna comes to that conclusion and decides to let things flow as it goes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalman also seems very stubborn about his opinion. So persuading him would take too much time, it&rsquo;d be better to just let him do what he wants.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">As such, Adalman and the thousands of survivors that are the undead </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s under his rule&mdash;&mdash;If anything, have all been dead&mdash;&mdash;are now under Shuman&rsquo;s command. The conquering of Clayman&rsquo;s castle thus concludes here.</span></p>

		<p class="c11 c10"><span class="c15 c4">Walpurgis Banquet </span></p>
		<hr>
		<p class="c11 c10 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is a luxurious door in front of us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once through, we arrive at the meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is a huge roundtable in there with twelve chairs spaced out with equal intervals.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is a total of ten Demon Lords with only Karion missing at the moment. That means there will be two more chairs even if I take one.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Misery leads me to my seat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that we will be seated according to the chronological order of becoming a Demon Lord. So I will sit on the furthest side, namely the back seat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I make no objection and decide to check out my surroundings as it is a rare opportunity for me to observe all the Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of which, there are only two people present at the moment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of which is Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She appears to have the most seniority and gets to sit in the top seat. She has been swinging her feet happily for some time..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s no different from a kid, so I&rsquo;ll ignore her for now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From my point of view, on Ramiris&rsquo; right sits a seductive red-haired man who is on the opposite side of me&mdash;&mdash;He is indeed a man, yet, his appearance is eerily charming. The handsome specimen just sits there casually.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both of his eyes are closed but he probably isn&rsquo;t asleep.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can easily tell that this guy is far from simple.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I activate &#12300;Analysis&#12301; yet his stats don&rsquo;t seem to be out of place. But my instinct tells me that this person is abnormal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has similar magicule count as Karion, just on a different wavelength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, you could mistaken him to really be green and can&rsquo;t even know &nbsp;control his aura with that amount of magicules.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, he can&rsquo;t fool my eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I guess, if it is the analysis skill of &#12300;Great Sage&#12301; that is put into this situation would probably be deceived all over the place. That is how he has cleverly disguised his information.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is misleading opponents to misjudge his strength by showing them false information. This is a contest even before the actual fight breaks out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that I recall, I&rsquo;ve got a mind-reading skill just like Dwarf King Gazel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My &#12300;Great Sage&#12301; is probably just like those skills, that other people would not be able to know its true capability without I actively lay out my cards and inform them of the skill. It would be a different case if the opponent has&#12300;Mind Reading&#12301; ability that can read one&rsquo;s deep subconscious. One would probably only come to the realization of such skill after being manipulated and exploited. But unless one fails to resist, it shouldn&rsquo;t have an effect at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why it is important to conceal skills at times.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It may act as a bluff when the opponents learn about your skill.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you really have it yet intentionally try to hide it, it will raise people&rsquo;s suspicion anyway.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s what this handsome (beautiful) man is doing right now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has deceived others&rsquo; &#12300;Analysis&#12301; to raises their suspicion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I personally believe there is a necessity to hide my power. That means to completely suppress my aura in order to prevent giving any information to the enemies, I think that would be the meaningful move.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the contrary, what this guy is doing, he can instead reads the analyzer&rsquo;s power. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To filter his opponents.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">First he would see if the opponent has the ability to extract intel. To put aside those incapable of the skill, once he encounters someone who is capable of doing so, he can observe the opponents&rsquo; reaction just like that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the opponent would even fear of his illusive disguise, he won&rsquo;t even put the opponent on his mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he encounters someone who realizes he is faking, he will send the message that his power is so immeasurable that his opponents won&rsquo;t dare antagonize him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And putting that aside for a moment, even with the false message he sends out, he displays a similar magicule possession as Karion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His real power is completely incalculable. Since now I understand what he&rsquo;s playing, I&rsquo;d better stay away from any trouble with him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The person clearly on a different level with me&mdash;&mdash;The man known as&#12300;Guy&#12301;. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soon after my observation of Guy, another powerful man walks into the meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is alone without any company.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His presence by itself is imposing enough. That man must be the Demon Lord Dagruel the Titan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He takes the seat one chair next to the right of Guy without hesitation, lowering down to his seat &nbsp;with much majesty. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, does that empty seat (in between) belong to Milim? </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I look towards Dagruel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although Guy is already very tall himself, Dagruel somehow seems even much bigger than him. Unexpectedly, his luxurious chair is able to adjust according to the man&rsquo;s size and is able to fit for Dagruel. It would seem everything in this room is some type of extravagant magical device.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Demon Lord was once the arch rival of Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His imposing looks are truly impressive, enough to admit that he is a worthy opponent of a &nbsp;&#12300;True Dragon&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of this Demon Lord Dagruel, his magicule level is through the roof.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s unknown when comparing him to Veldora, that who would have the edge in terms of strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can tell he has almost immeasurable amount of magicules, but I won&rsquo;t be able to give it an accurate reading unless seeing him in combat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, quality is more important than quantity.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No need to get so scared just because he has a bit more magicules.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s more important when it comes to how you utilize your strength most effectively. Combat depends on the quality of one&rsquo;s skill.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Demon Lord Dagruel seems quite skillful, so I should be on guard with him anyhow&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After observing Dagruel, another Demon Lord shows up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a handsome, fit man in sumptuous clothes. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he&rsquo;s not as tall as Dagruel, he&rsquo;s still above average. His facial features are stern and delicate.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His short curly blonde hair has a wild quality to it that reflects his energetic and aggressive personality.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To make a more straightforward metaphor, this man with his dazzling appearance looks a bit like a movie star.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Somehow I get the impression that he must be good at charming people.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two fangs sticking out of his mouth are most eye-catching.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He must be a Vampire&mdash;&mdash;meaning, this man is the Demon Lord Valentine.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Valentine sits down on Ramiris&rsquo; left.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Judging by the sequencing seats, this Demon Lord probably has the same level of seniority as Dagruel, both being ancient Demon Lords. It is said that the Vampire Demon Lord has been replaced before, it may just be that he has taken the place of his predecessor after that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Never mind, there&rsquo;s no use keeping my mind on the order of seats.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Compared to that, something else has caught my eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is Valentine&rsquo;s servants.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first one looks like an elderly male butler.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He must be some sort of master as he is not making a single movement like a statue.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has a similar logic to me as to surpass all of his Youki in order to prevent being revealed of his true strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second one is even more interesting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A very attractive and beautiful young girl with shining long silver hair.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her skin is pure and shining while her gold-silver pupils give off a devilish glow of blue and red. She has a kind of seductive beauty, as if she&rsquo;s halted her growth the very moment she was transiting from a girl to a woman has immortalized it forever.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She wears a dress similar to a maid outfit. Maids are all combat classes&mdash;&mdash;By that theory, it quite likely that the girl is very strong&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m surprised that such powerful individuals are merely subordinates to another.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another point worth mentioning is that this beautiful girl&rsquo;s Youki is so immense that it is almost spilling out, which she&rsquo;s actively allowing it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm, wait a second?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I cross eyes with that girl, something feels strange, yet I can&rsquo;t describe it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps I am worrying too much, considering that the Youki leaking from her just randomly changes attributes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer. &#12300;Analysis&#12301; result as following, Target&rsquo;s magicule storage is much higher than Demon Lord Valentine.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, of course.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have no way to assess the total magicules of this girl, but only know that she&rsquo;s got more than her master Demon Lord Valentine.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her method of concealment is extremely clever and people unlike me, who don&rsquo;t have an ultimate skill would not be able to see through.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even with that being said, she has no intention of hiding it as well. Like Guy, she probably wants to see whether the rest would notice.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;If that&rsquo;s the case, could this girl be the Demon Lord herself?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s possible that she is the retired ex-Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her true identity would be the female vampire &#12300;Milus&#12301; that even Veldora recognizes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is rumored that the last change in leadership was one thousand, five hundred years ago and the Demon Lords who know the details are less than a few. Did they acquiesce the act or did they really not notice?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or perhaps&mdash;&mdash;They may simply be uninterested.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve got to be cautious with her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The current Demon Lord Valentine is no weakling either. His power is unquestionable, given how his Haki feels even stronger than an untransformed Karion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s also accompanied by the seductive and beautiful maid.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If she is the Demon Lord whose kingdom was burnt to ashes, she has good reason to hate Veldora. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why in the world would you go provoke this type of people! I want to shout out, but hold back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Could this be the legendary syndrome of&#12300;My head hurts already and it&rsquo;s getting intensified </span><span class="c4 c30">send help</span><span class="c0">&#12301;?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I am to seek salvation in mind, should I perhaps think in line of &#12300;My life is complete by enraging and getting killed by this type of beauty&#12301;?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;No, I don&rsquo;t want that type of salvation after all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hope my relationship with Veldora won&rsquo;t get exposed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it does happen to be exposed, I hope I won&rsquo;t be cleaning up his mess (D: &ldquo;wiping his ass&rdquo; is the original sentence) for him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I pray to myself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Afterward, some time has passed since I got into this situation before the fifth person enters.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He enters alone with drowsy, sleepy eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are two swords sheathed at his belt and that&rsquo;s all his equipment. How convenient.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, he opens his eyes to momentarily reveal their beautiful light blue colour. His dark purple hair looks dark in the room, with silver strands mixed within.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looks rather young, almost like a high school student. He is quite handsome, but his sleepy eyes and lazy gestures reduce the appeal of his pretty face..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That guy wanders towards Ramiris and stops to greet her with his hand slightly raised.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Morning&mdash;&mdash;you are still tiny as ever.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Do you want to pick a fight? How cocky have you got, Dino the noob?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fifth one is Dino. I recall him to be the same kind of person as Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They aren&rsquo;t really arguing, but more like a routine quarrel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Silly, you know I&rsquo;ll win anyway, why would I look for you to fight.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh&mdash;&mdash;I see you&rsquo;ve gotten tired of living. Today I&rsquo;m feeling super good you know!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No way. You look like you&rsquo;ve shrunk. Have you grown smaller since the last time we met?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I can&rsquo;t help it! I&rsquo;ve been reincarnating lately!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris once said that it would take a couple hundred years before she could grow up. After asking for details, I was informed that she was only reincarnated about fifty years ago.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With her saying that, Dino seems to realize.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, that&rsquo;s why you look like this. Sounds pretty convenient. But, will the memories be carried over?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Of course it will. But, my spirit will devolve because of my body. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter since I&rsquo;m the strongest. That&rsquo;s why I need to let loose at times like this!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Guy, Ramiris seems to want to say something.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Baka! Are you an idiot! I know what to say to the right person! I&rsquo;ve never even thought of beating down Guy in one punch! (one pun~)&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing Dino trying to talk to the red-haired man, Ramiris immediately stops him. She begins to find excuses with her voice lowered to mumble her complaint.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s only good at words, and is super quick to change her stance.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that red-hair dude, sounds like he is indeed Guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He must be dangerous given how panicked Ramiris looks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Secretly, I take note that &#12300;Guy is dangerous&#12301;. I once avoided danger with this type of miniscule diligence, so I can&rsquo;t underestimate its usage.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to avoid provoking Guy, Ramiris and the rest only dare to whisper their conversation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The content seems to be related to Ramiris&rsquo; servants&mdash;&mdash;Beretta and Treyni-san.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris is showing off big time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehh? Why didn&rsquo;t you come by yourself, how come you brought servants this time? Won&rsquo;t I look uncool coming alone ?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh huh, yep. Now I can get back from those Demon Lords who call me a shrimp and say I&rsquo;m all alone without any love! Especially you! I&rsquo;ll let you know how useless you are against these two!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right then, wanna try to let them fight against me? Would it be alright if I break them?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah? You&rsquo;d better not! If you break them, I&rsquo;ll go tell Guy and let him punish you with his iron fists!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Part of that line sounds like a bluff.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris is just going to call for help without any shame.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;I mean these two, they probably can put up a good fight, right? They look really strong now that I look more closely!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Dino&rsquo;s remark, Beretta and Treyni-san both nod quietly in agreement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">*Sigh* what a waste to give these subordinates to Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right? Right! That&rsquo;s true, that means I speak with greater authority now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dino&rsquo;s words greatly please her as Ramiris shows her dominance by raising her flat chat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was me who helped making them two. Never mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta and Treyni-san remain silent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are both very competent servants.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Similarly, behind me, Shion is silent too&mdash;&mdash;and sleeping. I hope she would learn something from those two.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dino goes on to his own seat after the greeting, face slacked. His seat is next to Valentine. He seems like an ancient Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He ignores Valentine beside him and more surprisingly, starts to sleep on the table right away.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Valentine probably finds him extremely rude, but greetings between Demon Lords may be the actual anomaly here. Although Dino was running his mouth to tease Ramiris, his greeting to her may indeed be just an exception.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dino seems very unmotivated.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It gives off the vibe of &ldquo;Simply coming is enough&rdquo;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He doesn&rsquo;t care about the atmosphere of the meeting, simply playing the part &nbsp;of a sloth. In a sense he is a contrarian of his own.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His disregard for everything in turn, reflects his potent strength that enables such actions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;. I&rsquo;ll just consider that to be the case.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This guy also seems to have a blockade against analysis, his real power remains unknown.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I want to analyze him but instead he stares back with his eyes slightly lifted. He is indeed keeping his guard up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His interaction with Ramiris just before reflected his arrogant personality, so this guy can&rsquo;t be underestimated after all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, Dino did seem like he&rsquo;s treating Ramiris well. If possible, I don&rsquo;t want to antagonize him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Next, the Harpy Queen enters the meeting room.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">MIlim once mentioned her to me, she must be Demon Lord Frey.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her aura (sex appeal) is overflowing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her pair of breasts seem to have quite the air resistance, won&rsquo;t she feel inconvenient during flights?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh no, I accidently went astray. I&rsquo;m just a bit moved by how impactful her entry is.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of Frey, she looks towards me from Milim&#39;s empty seat, and her eyes fall on me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The way she squinting at people is also so sexy&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ahhhhhh, this is truly&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As she passes by me, her body fragrance also smells so good.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These thoughts keep swirling through &nbsp;my head, however, I sense a dangerous aura at my back. Obviously Shion is getting pissed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s found out that I was almost seduced, as expected of Shion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be a bad idea to make Shion get any angrier. I switch back to normal observation mode immediately.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her magicules are nothing special. If I have to be honest, it&rsquo;s even smaller than that of Shion and Benimaru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On that note, Shion&rsquo;s magicule count is catching up to Valentine, so her magicules aren&rsquo;t little at all. But its quality is the key. It would be too superficial to judge by its quantity.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The qualities of the two are hard to be distinguish by their breast sizes&mdash;&mdash;Eh, that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be relevant. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I suppose she must have a lot of hidden skills. She has a certain dangerous aura surrounding her, so it&rsquo;s not too far-fetched.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s about all the information I can extract from Frey, but there&rsquo;s one point worth pointing out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is the servants around her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of whom is a busty beauty who can rival Frey.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She still seems somewhat childish but her figure is still top notch.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other person is a tough guy possessing similar magicule levels to Frey. It is likely a male Harpy given the giant eagle wings on his back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s quite small compared to Dagruel, but he is just as fit as Valentine.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His face is covered by a lion mask, rendering me unable to analyze him. But&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lion?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer. According to the deduction of &#12300;Analysis&#12301;&mdash;&mdash;&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no way.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This person is on a completely different wavelength than Karion. There&rsquo;s no way that&rsquo;s him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; won&rsquo;t tell me, I can deduce this easily.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;...............&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he is indeed the missing Karion, he definitely wouldn&rsquo;t resort to such a disguise full of flaws to the Walpurgis Banquet. He would have been more careful and cautious.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Someone once said that there will be three people in the world who looks similar to oneself</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt38" id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup><span class="c0">. Frey&rsquo;s servant must be someone else.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After observing Frey&rsquo;s group, I suddenly have the illusion that freezing wind is blowing into the room.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I look towards that direction and witness the entry of a blonde beauty.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a beauty blessed with endorsement of gods.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such a beauty walks straight towards me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Are you Rimuru?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s right, and who are you&mdash;&mdash;I intend to ask back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t know this type of gorgeous beauty. But upon thinking so, I suddenly figure out his true identity.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are four more Demon Lords. With one of them being the missing Karion, we only have Clayman and MIlim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then it is Leon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I remember Leon has blonde hair&mdash;&mdash;so called &#12300;Platinum Demon&#12301;, the beautiful blonde Demon Lord&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;So, are you Leon? Why would you want to have a word with me?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes, I am Leon. I didn&rsquo;t come to you for anything in particular. It is just that I feel a sense of nostalgia seeing your face.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is indeed Leon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What a beautiful man, it may mislead people easily to think that he&rsquo;s a beautiful woman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">If it&rsquo;s me from the past, I would definitely shout in heart &#12300;WHAT THE HELL! (IT&rsquo;S A TRAP!)</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup><span class="c0">&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He used to be human yet he gives off an imposing aura.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He indeed has the presence of a Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of which, did Leon say he feels nostalgic? </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I look the exact same as when Shizue-san was young. In other words, Leon&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Leon, Shizue-san has already passed away.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t come to me for anything in particular, simply being reminiscent of Shizue-san.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I know. Of course she would die. Simply because she refused to accept Ifrit and didn&rsquo;t want to become a Majin.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon says it lighted-heartedly as if it was only natural.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;She once asked me to punch you in the face. Please allow me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The line slips out of my mouth without my thinking. I wasn&rsquo;t trying to look for trouble but Leon&rsquo;s attitude is irritating.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I say it clear and straight. But, Leon is not moved by it at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I refuse. I&rsquo;ve given Shizue a chance to choose for her own life. She didn&rsquo;t want to become a Majin and wanted to live as a human. I even gifted her Ifrit when we parted, so there&rsquo;s no reason for you to punch me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s surprising.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I would have thought he&rsquo;d get mad and call me rude. Yet he responds to me calmly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides from that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;However, I&rsquo;m also a little bit interested in you. If you want to complain to me, my treat. Or you can refuse if you think it&rsquo;s a trap. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter either way.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He says so himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It feels as though he&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come if you are scared&rdquo;, so I could only accept.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright, I&rsquo;ll accept. Remember to send an invitation.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I go silent after my response.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon nods his head slightly but with an annoyed twitch at how troublesome he thinks it would be.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, I&rsquo;ll do just that. But first, you have to return in one piece.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wraps up coldly and takes the seat on my left.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s not going to talk to me anymore.That&rsquo;s probably the end of that conversation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be enough progress on the matter for now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve relayed Shizue-san&rsquo;s words and I now know one more thing: Leon is not trying to make me an enemy. If he has considered me an enemy, why would he agree to send an invitation?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problem lies on what happens after that. Anyhow, I need to focus on dealing the enemy that is Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s been an hour since the time I first entered the meeting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Time passed on just like that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The order of leading the Demon Lords into the meeting room seems to be based on their experience. I was a guest so I happened to have the privilege to travel with Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, there&rsquo;s also someone like Leon who came in by his own strength, that doesn&#39;t seem to be a written rule.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now all there is left are Clayman and Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just when the Banquet was about to start, a thought flashed through my mind&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama, is it convenient for me to borrow some time of yours to report our progress? &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s Benimaru, he&rsquo;s communicating through &#12300;Telepathy Net&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The meeting seems to be in a different dimension, so how did &#12300;Telepathy Net&#12301; come through&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12298;Answer. You&rsquo;ve established connection with </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s under your rule with &#12300;Soul Corridor&#12301;. You can communicate through it.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;So that&rsquo;s how it worked.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that during my blessing, &#12300;Soul Corridor&#12301; was connected as well. It feels weaker than the one I use to contact Veldora, but it seems to work fine with communication.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I begin to listen to Benimaru&rsquo;s report.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s been less than an hour since the war started, yet it&rsquo;s already over. It sounds like it has been going exactly as planned.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our army has many injured but zero casualties. As for Clayman&rsquo;s army, there is more than a thousand deaths. There are over three thousand injured as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a surprisingly low death toll, but in this world, as long as one is alive, there is a chance of restoring them to their original state. So it&rsquo;s reasonable many weren&rsquo;t killed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In any case, we achieved complete victory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we caught prisoners, hooray!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The commanding officer of the enemies seems to have turned into Charybdis somehow, but was incinerated by Benimaru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am a bit out of loop with what he&rsquo;s saying.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since I can&rsquo;t understand, I&rsquo;ll just skip it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it is best that I skip it, but&hellip;.. How did he kill Charybdis when it has &#12300;Magic Interference&#12301;?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer. His unique skill &#12300;Great General&#12301; can compile multiple techniques and skills to perfectly control &#12300;Black Flame Prison&#12301;.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that&rsquo;s the case.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In short, his manipulation technique was superior than &#12300;Magic Interference&#12301; and was able to directly input massive amounts of heat. It may sound easy but it requires quite the level of skill.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru seems to have grown stronger than I&rsquo;ve anticipated. Very impressive!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What we didn&rsquo;t anticipate however, was the Worshipers of Dragon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are worthy as Milim&rsquo;s believers and seems to be an absurdly powerful battle group. They didn&rsquo;t engage with us seriously this time and thus allowed us to prevent casualties.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I should be the one to reflect.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It turns out I was wrong when I thought they would be no problem due to their only being one hundred in number.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I should have known better that war in this world depends on personal strength rather than the power of a group. I seem to have carelessly forgotten such common sense.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s most fortunate that we didn&rsquo;t get beaten to a pulp.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We must be more careful next time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to Benimaru&rsquo;s report, I have an overall idea of what Clayman will claim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is said that Clayman&rsquo;s army, alongside Midley&rsquo;s group under Yamoz&rsquo;s rule, is famously marching to investigate Karion&rsquo;s betrayal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is in order to collect evidence about Karion&rsquo;s betrayal of the Demon Lords and murder of Clayman&rsquo;s subordinate and my accomplice.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, that&rsquo;s not true.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not &lsquo;collecting&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;fabricating&rsquo;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now his plan has been disrupted due to our victory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wonder if he will find some other reasons later, but I doubt the other Demon Lords would agree with that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyhow, we will take down Clayman in the end, one way or another. If any Demon Lord gets in our way, we will just have to eliminate them as well, In order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we have to work hard now to make life easier for us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raphael-sama, I look forward to your performance!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;.............&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; seems very motivated as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I can be relieved for a moment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, Souei is also reporting in.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seems to have taken Clayman&rsquo;s base.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei is really badass. I heard he also had Hakurou to back him up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the most active member must have been Shuna.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">It seems some drama has occurred and for some reason, she has gained some undead </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as companions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am rather confused but Souei said&#12300;We will have Shuna-sama brief you on the specifics&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;. And that&rsquo;s equally baffling to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The important thing is that Demon Lord Karion was not detained in Clayman&rsquo;s castle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there&rsquo;s something else.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;We&rsquo;ve discovered a secret vault. We&rsquo;ve contacted Geld to conduct the transfer. There is also evidence of Clayman&rsquo;s association with the Moderate Clown Troupe. Please use them to your desire.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They seem to have robbed all of Clayman&rsquo;s treasures he&rsquo;s collected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is it considered thievery?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I shouldn&rsquo;t care about that. Clayman has brought us trouble, so I&rsquo;ll take his compensation with gratitude.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seems to have hidden many treasures in his time, so now our financial gain has gone over the roof.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In comparison, the more important evidence has has been collected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru and Souei have both mentioned it to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of the evidence have been transmitted to my &#12300;Stomach&#12301;. With it, I can topple all of Clayman&rsquo;s claims and sources.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s important to keep my reputation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like that, We&rsquo;ve decimated Clayman&rsquo;s forces at a much faster pace than I expected. Now we&rsquo;ll see how he reacts. We&rsquo;ll use all of our information to its fullest to put the favour on our side.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soon afterward&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I finish listening to the report, Clayman&rsquo;s party finally shows up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is surprisingly a handsome man, but at the same time, he looks somewhat psychotic&mdash;&mdash;This man is Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wears classy clothing that seems very fashionable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Demon Lord is indeed something else. He has special grade equipment all over his body. These alone seem to be able to form a strong combat force.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What concerns me more is the fox he is holding. Its monstrous power is extremely powerful, as well as its astonishing amount of magicules. Its power may reach that of a Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is one of the servants&mdash;&mdash;correction, it is. But since Clayman is a Demon Lord after all, his subordinates are pretty good as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My &#12300;Analysis &#12301; of Clayman has revealed something rather concerning. Although we&rsquo;ve taken his base, we still can&rsquo;t underestimate him, especially while wrapping up the end of our operation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Following just after is Milim; so now all of the Demon Lords are present.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone here is a monster not to be underestimated.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tried to run &#12300;Analysis&#12301; for Leon as well, yet was unable to analyze his power. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How interesting, &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; also says it can&rsquo;t be analyzed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, he has a similar skill to me&mdash;&mdash;Ultimate Skill.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, abruptly I realize something.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy is leaking fake intel to others&mdash;&mdash;Is it to counter Ultimate Skills?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If one is unable to be analyzed through Ultimate Skill, it means the opponent possesses an Ultimate Skill as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s quite possible that he he has released simply false information.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am only able to realise this because&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael &#12301; is very strong. Had I discovered this, I would have also been deceived.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that logic, Guy naturally has an Ultimate Skill as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milus? Highly suspicious, and the same can be said about Leon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultimate Skills all possess special yet incomparable functions. There are several important conditions in acquiring them, such as the user&rsquo;s ability, luck and timing. It is rumored that a rare skill isn&rsquo;t guaranteed even when someone becomes a True Demon Lord. Such power is indeed the &nbsp;ace up users&rsquo; sleeve. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I need to act more cautiously.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, I need to assume Guy has also realised that I have an Ultimate Skill.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a grave miscalculation on my part.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s all because of my lack of experience. My opponents are all cunning Demon Lords. I need to be much more careful in keeping my guard up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No use crying over spilled milk; it is not a major misstep for now. How I would deal with it in the future is more important.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is also difficult to grasp my true ability, just like Dwarf King Gazel and his mind reading ability . It would also mean that my opponents won&rsquo;t be able to tell the specifics of my abilities, so I don&rsquo;t need to worry myself over it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;d rather try to mislead him using this and pretend that I&rsquo;m oblivious on the matter.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be more specific, I need to hide&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301;. It won&rsquo;t hurt if others see my other Ultimate Skills then, if I always have Raphael as my trump card.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I do so, won&rsquo;t I have a trump card that will never be discovered?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is what I can do with possession of four different Ultimate Skills, a rather bold way to hide my skills.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could show them off during my battle against Clayman later, when it comes to it, then I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Proposal. &#12300;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&#12301; is very hard to conceal.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It can consume and dissipate dispersed attacks, a skill both capable of attack and defense. My combat abilities are mostly based of &#12300;Prey&#12301;, so it would be a good idea to show &#12300;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&#12301; to the public.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In future battles I&rsquo;ll focus on using &#12300;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&#12301; while hiding other skills. I&rsquo;ll adapt this tactic into all my fights.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I should be happy today that I got to come up with this new tactic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be meaningless if I&rsquo;m not willing to use my skills and end up dead because of it. If I can leave this place safely, I&rsquo;ll reconsider a new tactic after that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as I finish my reflection, I suddenly see something astounding.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Move faster, you retard!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman spits as he suddenly hits Milim violently.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitting Milim&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Too damn slow, go and sit down right now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He even poses all high and mighty after hitting and giving Milim orders.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m on the edge of becoming furious, but I push it back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not time yet, I just need to endure a little bit more.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before he moves on to start speaking according to the rules of Banquet, I have to hold on to my anger&hellip;....</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of which, what in the world happened to MIlim?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim being bullied like that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the two were to switch places and have Clayman being the one hit, it would be a normal and a typical sight to see.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, what a poor guy, and that would be it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was violent towards Milim and beating her, yet he was not punished for it at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim didn&rsquo;t resist, not even having a word of complaint.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She remains obedient and sits in her seat without a word.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How strange.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Could Milim really be under Clayman&rsquo;s control? </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that I need to consider the worst case scenario.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides I am not the only one surprised at it, other Demon Lords such as Dagruel and Dino also exchange confused looks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t change at all, there is no way to know what he is thinking.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman on the other hand looks all superior and smug.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing his face, my fury is again ignited.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you think you will get a quick death Clayman. I&rsquo;ll make you pay for hitting my friend, Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I promise in my heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is dead meat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I won&rsquo;t let him walk away, no matter what reason he has.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, I can&rsquo;t rush it just yet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Banquet is about to begin.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The participants of the Walpurgis Banquet is as following:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ten Great Demon Lords, minus Karion, nine Demon Lords in total.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demon&mdash;&mdash;&#12300;Lord of Darkness&#12301; Guy Crimson.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dragonoid&mdash;&mdash;&#12300;Destroyer&#12301; Milim Nava.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fairy&mdash;&mdash;&#12300;Fairy of Labyrinth&#12301; Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Titan&mdash;&mdash;&#12300;Rage of Earth&#12301; Dagruel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vampire&mdash;&mdash;&#12300;Bloody Lord&#12301; Roy Valentine.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fallen Angel&mdash;&mdash;&#12300;Sleeping Ruler&#12301; Dino.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Harpy&mdash;&mdash;&#12300;Sky Queen&#12301; Frey.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Undead Elf&mdash;&mdash;&#12300;Marionette Master&#12301; Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ex-Human&mdash;&mdash;&#12300;Platinum Saber&#12301; Leon Cromwell.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And one other person.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The protagonist of this Banquet&rsquo;s subject-matter, the one who dares to proclaim to be a new Demon Lord&mdash;&mdash;Me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of Guy&rsquo;s maids named Rain begins to introduce everyone with a cold tone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m most interested in Leon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fuse once told me that Demon Lord Leon has the nickname &#12300;Platinum Demon&#12301;, but now it is changed into a cooler title of &#12300;Platinum Saber&#12301;,</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He does give off the look of it, but who on earth came up with these titles?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Could it be himself&mdash;&mdash;No&hellip;&hellip;. I shouldn&rsquo;t say that. I&rsquo;m not qualified to judge other people. Let&rsquo;s try to avoid this type of topic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s about it as the introduction comes to a conclusion, when Clayman stands up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Well then, I much appreciate everyone to have answered the invitation to the Banquet today. We shall now begin our feast! I hereby announce the official unveiling of the Walpurgis Banquet!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He announces the start of the meeting as the meeting holder, </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that, with the foreshadowing feeling of imminent storm, Walpurgis Banquet is officially convened.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman leaves his seat and in a swoop as transforming the meeting room into his personal stage, he begins his speech.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looks rather satisfied, glancing around at all the Demon Lords, including me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His eyes seems to have stopped at Demon Lord Valentine, but that might have just been a trick of the light. It&rsquo;s none of my business either way, I may have just thought too much.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon is sitting to my left, while the seat on my right is empty.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One seat over my right would be Clayman&rsquo;s seat. On his right is an empty seat that belongs to Karion who has gone missing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman starts explaining the cause of this whole ordeal rather smugly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His words are prolix and lengthy, but I still decide to listen to them seriously.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here&rsquo;s what he has to say:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One, Demon Lord Karion has instigated me to proclaim myself a Demon Lord. The evidence for this is that Karion&rsquo;s army stationed in our town.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two, Rimuru instigated Falmas Kingdom to attack the Great Jura Forest. This also served as an excuse for Rimuru to attack the humans.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Three, I (Rimuru) defeated Falmas Kingdom and proclaimed myself Demon Lord with Karion secretly backing me up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He thinks Karion&rsquo;s actions were violations to the rules among the Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman&#39;s claims has completely overlooked the actual chronology of events. They are all excuses but are hard to prove otherwise. His accusation is much more discreet than I expected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, his accusations of our actions happen to be after the Demon Lords&rsquo; non-aggression pact of Jura Great Forest was withdrawn. So the evidence of crime is all clear.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 556.00px; height: 810.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image20.png" style="width: 556.00px; height: 810.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But what the hell does any of them have to do with me?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman adds on even more.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;through this, I stand by my testimony. However, my subordinate Myuran who reported me all this have been murdered by that donkey named Rimuru. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve decided to avenge her.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What an act! Clayman&rsquo;s so good at acting that my praise almost slipped out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m almost moved to tears by his performance&mdash;&mdash;like hell I am. Myuran is still alive!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;This Rimuru has planned with Karion to kill me. Myuran was able to inform me of it with her last bit of strength through &#12302;Magic Communication&#12303;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon saying so, Clayman looks rather emotional. It could almost be a piece of art, with how handsome he looks, but I&rsquo;m still pissed with how fond he is of acting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did Clayman say that I want to kill him and take his seat as Demon Lord?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that the one behind this scheme was Karion? What a story he has come up with. Karion has the integrity of a samurai (warrior), so people who know him would probably burst into laughter hearing this story. All of these are just sophistry&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Clayman finishes his speech with a tangent, focusing on Karion&rsquo;s betrayal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And because of that, Milim losing her nerve, went to destroy the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania, killing Kairon in the process&mdash;&mdash;These are his claims.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion was killed? It&rsquo;s very suspicious how he hasn&rsquo;t mentioned that Karion has gone missing. It doesn&rsquo;t seem right, so I&rsquo;ll see what Clayman has to say about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim was doing all of this for Clayman&rsquo;s sake, but Clayman scolded her later about how it was inappropriate without evidence. After the incident, Milim began admiring Clayman and asked for his help a lot&hellip;&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to get his hands on evidence of the collusion between me and Karion after his subordinate was killed, Clayman decided to march. Such is his narrative of the events.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He also mentioned that I was going to kill him and claim to be a Demon Lord afterward, which he couldn&rsquo;t tolerate and thus decided to lure me out and execute me through the verdict of the Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is truly impressive how he can make up such a story that puts so much favour on his side.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But with that being said, his explanation is too lengthy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was going to listen to Clayman&rsquo;s arguments and come up with my own points to argue back in hopes of proving my innocence and defeating Clayman reasonably.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the only reason why I&rsquo;ve listened to him so patiently for all this time, but now I can&rsquo;t tolerate it anymore.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is it not time to strike?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After hearing Clayman&rsquo;s words, I discover the fatal flaw in his argument.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no evidence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from testimony, Clayman&rsquo;s claims are not backed up by any other evidence. And upon inspecting these testimony, they are mostly from Clayman&rsquo;s loyal servant&mdash;&mdash;Ring Finger Myuran.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What a joke.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Myuran is still alive, so his testimony has little to none credibility.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem that he didn&rsquo;t have time to fabricate evidence. Now I can finally prove my innocence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have already prepared key evidence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;As such, I am done. Now that everyone has learnt about the story from start to finish, this Rimuru here is a despicable Majin and an idiot for daring to proclaim himself as a Demon Lord. It is best if we eliminate him&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman says so as he was concluding for his explanation looking all high and mighty.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Lords are quite patient, having willingly listened to his boring and lengthy story. But someone did fall asleep among them, but he won&rsquo;t pose trouble so it&rsquo;s understandable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rules seems to say that everyone has to listen to the speaker finish explaining without a word.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is at this point when the Demon Lords apparently may express their opinions freely. However, this time they have me as both the guest and the person in question.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rain seems to be appointed as host, as the maid looks towards me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Now then, allow me to explain to everyone.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s finally my turn.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve endured till now. Now to stop dancing with this clown. (D: Literally)</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are Clayman, right? I mean, you are just a giant liar.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;m gonna be honest with you;I don&rsquo;t care whether or not I become a Demon Lord. The thing you said about Karion-san&rsquo;s instigation was all nonsense. And the Falmas Kingdom attacked due to their greed. The two incidents has no connection whatsoever.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I say so as Clayman throws an annoyed glare at me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh! Who would believe such excuses? My subordinate also got killed!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He adds, which plays right into my court.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is she called Myuran? I didn&rsquo;t kill her, she&rsquo;s still alive, you know?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ha! And I thought you were&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Anyway, listen up now. All of your claims have been mere hearsay and your personal deduction. It may work for more gullible people, but I won&rsquo;t buy it. Your witness Myuran is now under my protection. I won&rsquo;t allow you to do a thing to her, and your testimony has zero credibility.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon saying so, even Clayman&rsquo;s expression changed drastically. But, he seems to only disagree with my statements.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehe, how despicable of you to do such a thing. You must have done something to Myuran&rsquo;s corpse and allowed an evil spirit to possess her.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He immediately questions my claim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, there is magic in this world that can even hide ambiguity of life and death. What a headache to deal with.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It thus means that the testimony doesn&rsquo;t anything.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It would seem that you&rsquo;ve decided to deny everything. That&rsquo;s why I was being clear with you, but I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. Before the Banquet started, my companions assisted me in collecting evidence.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I say so with much disdain in my eyes towards Clayman as I smile slightly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is enraged by the sight. This guy seems more simple than I expected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What do you mean by that? If you wish to die so badly then&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t get ahead of yourself now, Clayman. I told you that I have evidence.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I interrupt Clayman and take out a couple of crystal balls from my pocket.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The crystal ball is then transferred to the center of the round table and activates its magical effect one by one.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every crystal ball carries a video recording.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is footage of the fights between my subordinates and Orc Lord through Gelmud&rsquo;s point of view. These are all discovered by Shuna from the ancient castle at Clayman&rsquo;s base.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, there are also crystal balls recording the battle that just concluded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are from Benimaru as he&rsquo;d recorded every bit of the battle under his watch and from his memory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are some interesting scenes in them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;S-stop! Please don&rsquo;t do this, Clayman-sama!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s Clayman&rsquo;s subordinate screaming as his body turns into an incomplete version of Charybdis.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;What a surprise, but I knew Yamoz would betray&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Clayman&rsquo;s army is routed. The mission is a failure. We&rsquo;ve suffered a lot of loss&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Even Laplace went to persuade him, it&rsquo;s all Clayman&rsquo;s fault this time&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We have to report to that Lord&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so on.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In front of Geld and Phobio, the suspicious clowns conversed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are the members of Moderate Clown Troupe, Footman and Tear. It must be since they also mentioned Laplace.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And &#12300;That Lord&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I originally thought that Clayman was behind the scenes all this times but as it turns out someone else was behind Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Could it be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer. These series of events are all related to him.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Of course.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This mysterious man who has been pulling the strings in the dark, setting me against Hinata and manipulating Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why the timings were so precise.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I was battling the Western Saints Church, Clayman had the chance to instigate Falmas Kingdom and that led to the tragedy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could &nbsp;understand simply seeing me as an eye-sore.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, you&rsquo;ve crossed the line this time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I will take all of you down.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&rsquo;t blame me. After all, this is the jungle for the survival of the fittest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s called proof, Clayman.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I say with a victorious smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be honest, it&rsquo;s much easier to do things with evidence. But there are still plenty of ways to resolve things without it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, we could just beat the crap out of him in a fair fight and then find some reason to get ourselves by the blames just like what Clayman is trying to do.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not about right or wrong, but about our image.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now with real evidence presented, he won&rsquo;t have any comeback.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;S-stop it! What nonsense is this?! How dare you try to bluff your way out with forged, fake footage made by magic. Don&rsquo;t try such dirty tricks, you slime!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Bluffing? That&rsquo;s not bluffing at all, baka~ We decimated your army. And you are next.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman looks at me angrily.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;E-everyone, don&rsquo;t get fooled by him! This slime called Rimuru is really good at bluffing. He unlocked the seal of Veldora and eliminated the Falmas army with him. Then he claims that it was his own power to show off, what a scumbag! No real Demon Lord would be fooled by this guy!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman throws everything he has to continue his act.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How dare you try finding someone to back yourself up now, aren&rsquo;t you the real scum of the earth?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be really impressive if you do is just act all of this out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi, Clayman. Didn&rsquo;t you just say that this Rimuru provoked Falmas Kingdom? If it&rsquo;s true that Veldora has been revived, why would he bother to trouble himself by doing all this?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;T-that&rsquo;s because&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The question came from an unexpected place.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel speaks up and questions Clayman with much majesty.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is troubled for a while and decides to go all out with his response.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright, then allow me to explain.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Clayman begins to explain, exaggerating and overstating it once more, using body language to convey it</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If one is to collect human souls, one will awake to become a True Demon Lord&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seems to have hidden this matter in hope of preventing the other Demon Lords to get the benefits of it first. Now that Dagruel has asked, he has to open up and state things clearly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;This reckless, lowly slime was lucky enough to evolve to the Demon Lord Breed. Then he went over the line to have human society investigate the truth. After which he presumptuously caused a war between human and </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">. And orchestrated a massacre using Veldora who has been sealed and allowed it to rampage out in the world. Our reputation as Demon Lord will plummet as a result. That&rsquo;s why I think we must eliminate him, what do you all think?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With his emphasised body language, Clayman attempts to persuade the other Demon Lords of his case. .</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So what, you would need evidence for that. Can you even give us that? You&rsquo;re daydreaming if you think that would work. No one here would approve what you are proposing.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman stares at me with hatred, but he can stare all he wants.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m tired of his nonsense. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehh&hellip;&hellip;. Don&rsquo;t you look down on me, you slime, bluffing just because you have the power of the evil dragon! Likes of you could never become a Demon Lord.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;It&rsquo;s irrelevant whether or not I am a slime. Besides Veldora is my friend. But I have not come here to listen to your nonsense. You should just give up and &nbsp;just admit that those clowns followed </span><span class="c4 c8">your </span><span class="c0">instructions in reviving the Charybdis. The Majin called Phobio in those footages can testify that he&rsquo;s been encouraged by that clown &ldquo;Footman&rdquo;! Moreover, your subordinate just caused a havoc after transforming into Charybdis. This is all clear evidence. Call me a bluff if you want, but you can go to hell, thinking that.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I kick off the chair next to me to get up and contend against Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I put forward my hand casually put it where my hand is about to touch at the round table. The gigantic round table disappears instantly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is nothing surprising about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s simply consumed by my &#12300;Gluttonous King Beezlebuth&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I&rsquo;ve cleared out a large space.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The kicked chair &nbsp;flys on behind Clayman and collides against the wall loudly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Lords don&rsquo;t seem to be moved by it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The only one scared is Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Everyone, how can you tolerate such violent behaviour from this guy!? He&rsquo;s even ignoring our authority. We should punish him together!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Together he says.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As expected, this guy is real scum.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stand up entirely and move towards the center of the empty round space surrounded by chairs.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, I don&rsquo;t care whether I become Demon Lord or not. I just want to create a country satisfactory for myself. I need human help in that aspect, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve decided to protect the humans. If anyone dares to intrude, whether they be humans, Demon Lords or the Saints Church, they are all my enemies. For instance, you, Clayman.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I take a even more avid approach compared to Clayman and announce my ideal in front of the Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHAT&mdash;&mdash;!!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;As for violent behaviour, you said, did you plan to attend the Walpurgis Banquet while trying to mind control others?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I fix my eyes on Clayman and ask.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He must think I didn&rsquo;t notice. He was quite arrogant, thinking he could cast a psychic attack on me halfway through his speech.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He probably wanted to control me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it won&rsquo;t work.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Simply because &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; is always protecting me. Attacks like that will always be nullified instantly</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But with that being said, I now have a justified approach.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could argue that, in a sense, Clayman was the one who striked first.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If any other Demon Lords dare to confront me on this, I&rsquo;ll see what to do with them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I make up my mind to resort to violence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But after I said so with much resolve. Unexpectedly, it is not Clayman who responds, but the top seat and the dominator of the meeting .</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No. Here, everyone is equal and everyone can express his opinion of others.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The red-haired Demon Lord Guy says.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looks rather intrigued, giving off a small smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But Guy, this guy is insulting the Demon Lords&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Cut the crap. You don&rsquo;t see me eye to eye, so shouldn&rsquo;t it be a problem between us?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right, Clayman. You are a Demon Lord as well. Then go and defeat this Majin by yourself. And you&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy tells Clayman to shut up and looks towards me while saying:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Do you want to be a Demon Lord?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes. Since I&rsquo;ve already taken the position as the leader of the Jura Great Forest Alliance. The humans have seen me as a Demon Lord for a long time now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They won&rsquo;t care about the story, all they will care about is that I&rsquo;ve collaborated with the evil dragon in taking over the forest. That&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t deny even if people call me a Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Very well, everyone here shall be the witness. If you can beat Clayman here and now, we&rsquo;ll approve your becoming a Demon Lord.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy announces to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I can defeat Clayman, we can settle everything nicely.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s just what I want.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman quickly regains his composure and begins to laugh.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Gogogo, my goodness. I plotted all this so I won&rsquo;t get my hands dirty, yet things got even more complicated than I expected. How unwise I was.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman says so while laughing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is he accepting the reality?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman he laughs at me coldly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s time for you to shine, Milim.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He says so calmly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The atmosphere immediately becomes much, much more tense; even the Demon Lords become nervous along with it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although some of them retain their same, casual expression and posture.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My eyes also fall on Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has kept shown his hand&mdash;&mdash;Milim is under his control. It seems that this has made Clayman quite confident.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Up to this point, Clayman would exploit her without hesitation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim is indeed being manipulated&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are truly amazing at running your mouth. With all these said, how could you still rely on other people in the end? Now you dare to involve Milim. I&rsquo;ll beat some sense into you then.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I attempt to provoke Clayman with these words, but&hellip;&hellip;. Clayman is no fool, not foolish enough to fall for it anyway.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How boring. It goes without saying that I will fight as well. Guy, do you have an objection?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Not at all, Clayman. If Milim is willingly helping you, then I won&rsquo;t interfere.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is no good.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman alone is fine, but Milim is very strong.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy agrees without thinking, it would seem that I have to confront Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If my opponent is Milim, I won&rsquo;t be able to beat her with my current power level.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides I want to find a way to save her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I must save her!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now, Milim, who seems to be frozen, seems to be holding her fist tight, looking no difference from a doll and raises her hands to do a victory pose&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;No, that was just an instant, maybe I&rsquo;ve been mistaken.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seriously, what a poor thing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m gonna save you soon, Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I swear to myself in heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right then. I was planning to save Milim anyway, I&rsquo;ll break your brainwashing technique if it takes everything I have.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Surely you jest! And you will die trying.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are the one who&rsquo;s going to die, Clayman. If it were against you alone, my subordinates will suffice. It would be bullying for me to fight you myself.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman&rsquo;s expression seems frozen by my words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s probably mad as he begins to dissipate black Youki.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As expected from a Demon Lord. There is plenty of pressure in the air.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, it feels pretty average.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, Clayman will probably show some openings because of his anger and anxiety.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion is going to fight in my place, she&rsquo;s good at exploiting those traits.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I signal with my eyes towards Shion and she takes action immediately. In a blink of an eye she closes in on her opponent and strikes towards Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She infuses her Youki into her fists and launches thirty something punches.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then she turns back, looking delighted, and asks me: &#12300;Is this okay?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oi, shouldn&rsquo;t you ask that before beating other people?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I only glanced at you once.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Did you get it? Clayman has been provoked by my words, now take your chance!&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sent out such signal to her, but I didn&rsquo;t tell her to beat the enemy to a pulp in an instant.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then what&rsquo;s the point of me exposing enemies&rsquo; openings&hellip;&hellip;?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">*Sigh*, but what can you do when the man is already beaten.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman was launched flying due to the impact of the hits and fell in front of me. That is the middle ground of the empty round space.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;B-bastard, you bastard&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman begins to shout out loud as he gets up from the ground. He is surprisingly durable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The thick black Youki that wrapped around him suddenly thickens and heals all of his wounds instantly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s much stronger regenerative ability compared to Orc Lord. But he is a Demon Lord, so abilities such as this should be normal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman seems to be targeting Shion as enemy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alright, things are going according to plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;As you wish, I&rsquo;ll kill you all.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By Clayman&rsquo;s order, the fox that ran to his feet begins to grow bigger.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Warning. This is deduced to be the Nine-Head Beast Myuran mentioned.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh yeah, with that reminder, I do recall her mentioning this to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This fox indeed is no pet, but a powerful servant of his.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And another one of them emerges from the shadow of Clayman&rsquo;s black cape.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem both of these are his servants.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back on our side, Shion is also preparing for battle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga also begins to enlarge and prepares, falling into a battle stance.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eh? Milim is also joining, we seem to be losing in terms of numbers&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No no no, it&rsquo;s no time to panic yet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now Beretta could&mdash;&mdash;Ah!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have all stepped into the circle that used to be the round table. This is a battle stage: once you&rsquo;ve stepped in, a barrier near the edge will completely cut you off from the outside. The space within also begins to expand, and the chairs outside of the circle now seem very far away. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to prevent the interference of other Demon Lords, a strong bound of barrier also seems to have been set up. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Never mind, I was expecting this when I cleaned up the space for a stage.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My helper Beretta has yet to enter.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh no, I&rsquo;ve been tricked&mdash;&mdash;As soon as the thought flashes, Clayman shouts loud.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Milim, kill that guy!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He roars.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim begins to move.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She begins to throw her iron fists at me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The power of which are lethal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, my perception has been increased a million times by &#12300;Thought Acceleration&#12301;. With it I still have a chance to dodge.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, I have a chance, nothing more than that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The burning hard block scratches my face cheek.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The speed is incredibly fast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even with &nbsp;&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; fully in use, I still can&rsquo;t &nbsp;dodge them perfectly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I attempt to counter, I will show openings and suffer a fatal blow. If that&rsquo;s the case, I can only try my best at keeping her occupied while trying to help her escape her brainwashed state.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, I&rsquo;m using &#12300;Magic Perception&#12301; to show the situation around before me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Multitasking Rimuru is terrifying.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now it&rsquo;s no time for joke.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion is still fighting against Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, she&rsquo;s also fighting the black cape servant. It&rsquo;s hard to maintain an advantage while fighting two alone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga is batlling the Nine-Head Beast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I thought we had the upper hand, yet I see the Youko&rsquo;s three tails suddenly turn into two Majins.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now it suddenly changed into a three on one. It&rsquo;s disadvantageous to Ranga.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And lastly there&rsquo;s me, who needs to deal with Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve run out of options here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could only pray that I will survive long enough that my &#12300;Analysis&#12301; on Milim can be completed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m relying on them about what is coming after that!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With such feeling, our fight breaks out with us being in disadvantage.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta takes action immediately.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He ardently begged &nbsp;Ramiris to join the battle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris didn&rsquo;t refuse and ran to bother Guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh, Guy! I&rsquo;m on Rimuru&rsquo;s side and want to let my Beretta join the fight!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris begins to demand Guy not knowing her place, but Guy&rsquo;s response is very cold.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is not buying it at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Why?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh? This is a battle between Demon Lords. How could you let a mere servant join the fight. Besides, isn&rsquo;t it a fight between that slime and Clayman? Why is that &nbsp;any of your business?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t be so mean! Milim has also joined the battle.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, but that is fine.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What is that supposed to mean? Why won&rsquo;t you allow me then?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Annoying as hell&mdash;&mdash;Guy thinks to himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris was a always an annoying fairy, and once she decides to be noisy she just won&rsquo;t stop.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To this day Ramiris has never brought servants to the meeting. That&rsquo;s why Guy thought there must be some hidden motives why Ramiris has brought servants this time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">MIlim also seems to be planning something, it will only makes things more chaotic if Ramiris decides to join the battle. In order to prevent this from happening, Guy has intentionally separated the battle zone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Aren&rsquo;t you annoying, Milim is probably planning something on her own.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You say it as if I&rsquo;ve not come up with any genius plan!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is it not that the case? Moreover&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he says so, Guy looks towards one of Ramiris&rsquo; servants, Beretta.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Who&rsquo;s your servant loyal to? The other one&rsquo;s protecting you with all her heart, but this one really isn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s loyal to you on the surface, but is he completely loyal to you? Are you really fine with dealing with this type of unknown retainer?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy can tell.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta is loyal to someone else besides Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris is an important friend of Guy&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s why he can&rsquo;t tolerate that her servant isn&rsquo;t completely loyal to his master.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are indeed right, I am comparing my master to someone else.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta is not troubled hearing Guy&rsquo;s words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His summoner is Rimuru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And his creator is Rimuru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet he also has another master, which is Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Demon Lord is very optimistic, reckless everywhere she goes, curious like an infant and extremely timid. Beretta has grown a liking towards her and her personality.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why he doesn&rsquo;t feel worn out by his job of being toyed around by her all day.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru wants him to protect Ramiris. He is also glad that he himself is able to serve Ramiris. So he doesn&rsquo;t feel conflicted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there is one point.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta still wishes to repay Rimuru&rsquo;s kindness.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is Rimuru who introduced him to Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was once of the Demon race. Rimuru was able to give him a new life and new duty&mdash;&mdash;He wants to repay such kindness.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Similar to my wish, Ramiris-sama also wants to save that Lord&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta asserts without restraint towards Guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh? You are not afraid of me and dare to talk straight to me. Interesting. Ramiris, is this guy speaking the truth?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy asks, but he realises it&rsquo;s unnecessary as soon as he sees her expression.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm! Of course it&rsquo;s true! That&rsquo;s why Beretta, go in my place and save Rimuru!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehh&mdash;&mdash;So this guy will carry out your wish. You&rsquo;ve recruited quite the servant, Ramiris. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, I didn&rsquo;t recruit him, I am his companion. Beretta, Treyni and Rimuru, too! And many, many, many more!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris says so with a joyful smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Never mind, I&rsquo;ll allow this.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy doesn&rsquo;t know what Ramiris is trying to get out of this, but as long as she&rsquo;s happy it&rsquo;s fine. He does not object.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He puts forward his hand looking impatiently and opens a hole in the barrier.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Many thanks, Primordial Red (Rouge).&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm. Spare me the title. I&rsquo;ll allow you to call me Guy. But from now on, you can only recognize Ramiris as your master, do you understand?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Allowing him to call his name&mdash;&mdash;To Guy, this means he has recognized Beretta&rsquo;s strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And right now, Guy wants Beretta to choose a master. If he doesn&rsquo;t, Guy plans to end him right there.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Beretta agrees without hesitation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then, Guy. I shall pledge my loyalty towards Ramiris. For that reason, please allow me help Rimuru-sama out this once.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy is a bit surprised.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To the Demon race, their master must be strong enough. Yet Beretta doesn&rsquo;t seem to be interested in strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What an odd ideal. In other words, he is an outcast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that all?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes. Rimuru-sama has servants stronger than me to serve him.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that&rsquo;s the case, Guy thinks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he also begins to doubt. Beretta has openly admitted that someone is stronger than him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Besides, I really enjoy research. Everyday spent with Ramiris-sama researching is like a dream&mdash;&mdash;Oh, apologies. Rimuru-sama also wishes for me to serve Ramiris-sama. There is no need for you to worry.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing Beretta, Guy suddenly recalls a certain Demon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To pursue things that one desires and those only, that is the alternative definition for outcasts.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From his type alone, it won&rsquo;t be anything strange to have given birth to a Demon with the personality similar to Beretta&mdash;&mdash;But everyone knows that particular Demon do not create vessels often.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, very few people know about him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I have a question. Which branch (faction) are you from&mdash;&mdash;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta turns his face up behind his mask, and a smile becomes visible.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;I am just a humble nobody, a Greater Demon. But, Demons from the same branch as mine are very rare.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rare system&mdash;&mdash;Then it can be confirmed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now Beretta&rsquo;s hair color has faded to silver, but its original color was probably&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I see. That&rsquo;s why you are not afraid of me. Your kind of Demon always do what your heart desires and put your personal feelings first. Does that mean you admit someone is stronger than you?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy glances towards the battling Shion and Ranga and turns back to look at Beretta.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion and Ranga are indeed strong. But, Beretta is definitely not weaker.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I feel much honor receiving your praise, but my abilities are nothing to be mentioned. With that Lord serving Rimuru-sama, I won&rsquo;t have another chance to show my skills.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, I see. I understand how you feel. Go on.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The hole on the barrier is large enough for one person to pass.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then excuse me for my leaving.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta bows elegantly before proceeding without hesitation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy smiles as he sees him off.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has sensed what&rsquo;s weird.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He knows the one Beretta is talking about.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">&mdash;&mdash;Is that so? You are on the move too, Primordial Black (Noir)!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His old friend that parted way with him eons ago.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This newcomer has even recruited character like that. This slime battling Milim has suddenly become very intriguing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The outcast serves the outcast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">His name seems to be Rimuru. I&rsquo;ll remember it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With such thoughts, Guy observes the fight with delight. The result of which seems very obvious to him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is bad.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you ask me which part of this is bad, it would be Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Combating her is really strenuous, to the point that I&rsquo;ve even had to let go of my anger towards Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She hasn&rsquo;t applied any combat style that Phobio hasn&rsquo;t seen yet (referring to vol 3 event), so she probably hasn&rsquo;t gone all out yet&hellip;&hellip; But she is so overpowered to the point of unreasonable. I&rsquo;ve already been giving all I have.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; was able to display its power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be honest, I would be dead long ago if not because of the skill.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s about how I feel as I was busy fighting Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, my subordinates are also fighting hard.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I originally thought that our number is down in this fight, however&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga has summoned two commander level vessels of Tempest Star Wolf, changing the three on one to three against three.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem that he could only summon three simultaneously. One of which has been summoned by Gobuta so now he can&rsquo;t call for more reinforcements.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that should be sufficient.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nine-Head Beast has incredibly high amount of magicule storage, but it seems to be lacking in combat experience.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga still have the upper hand when fighting it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">With that being said, the two </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">s summoned by Nine-Head Beast are surprisingly difficult to deal with.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">They are White Ape and Moon Rabbit</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt40" id="ftnt_ref40">[40]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;according to results of my &#12300;Analysis&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two are capable of conducting collaborated counter-attack with plenty high intelligence. It&rsquo;s very challenging to deal with. The Moon Rabbit is able to manipulate gravity to pressure the battle zone while the White Ape is flying all over the place while hitting down hard. The Nine-Head Beast on the other hand is responsible for delivering the fatal blow to enemies.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This combat strategy is almost invincible.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Ranga has seen through their tactic and disrupted the cooperative approach employed by the enemies.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He could have used a more powerful attack to achieve victory, but he&rsquo;s afraid to affect Shion in that way.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is with the upper hand indeed, but he is able to deliver the final blow.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for Shion&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is holding up with brute force.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The black-cape is a delicate magic doll. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And honestly, it looks stronger than Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehehehahahaha, how do you like my finest work Piorra? Isn&rsquo;t it dazzling?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is extremely confident, but not without his reason.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The doll is undoubtedly powerful.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, if you ask me whether it looks dazzling (pretty) or not, the answer it&rsquo;s no.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because it is equipped with weapons all over its body.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every item is a special grade weapon as well as its armor. Yet with too many of them stuck onto it, there isn&rsquo;t any sense of aesthetic at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fire, lightning, ice, heavy weight, resonance, as well as other attacks seem to be constantly poured out by it without an end.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Shion doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind these attacks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any enemy she encounters would have to deal with the troubling skill of &#12300;Super Regeneration&#12301;. Thanks to this skill, she can restore herself instantly no matter what type of attack she encounters to resolve the crisis.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now, due to the combined attack by Clayman and Piorra, she is unable to launch any attack. However, Shion&rsquo;s rage meter is also building up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be horrifying if all of her rage explodes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I thought so, someone entered to assist Shion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Kept you waiting huh. Rimuru-sama, allow me to assist you all.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh oh, it&rsquo;s Beretta!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t know how he got in, but Beretta was successful in entering this separated battle zone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve been expecting you, Beretta!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes sir!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How dare you interrupt our business&hellip;&hellip; I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s gonna use these fools for blood sacrifice!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion is just being afraid of losing, they are just words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Be my guest. Beat the carp out of them!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;Yes sir&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that, the situation is proceeding as original plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our victory is imminent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although there was some unexpected interludes, but as how things have developed so far, we will definitely be the winner.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If any problem&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s that Milim has yet to show any her true color so far.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as we rescue Milim, we would secure the win.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I have no more worries and can focus myself entirely on Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The noises of my surrounding gradually disappear.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My concentration is clear with Milim fixed in my eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The trajectory of her fists seems clearer now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I continue to concentrate my mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of the cells in my body are running at maximum proficiency to do the calculation. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would all be a waste if I lose.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I must find a way to remove the curse spell Clayman used to manipulate Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Come on, Raphael-san. Run &#12300;Analysis&#12301; at its full power!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You guys would probably say it&rsquo;s hypocritical that I just mocked other people for relying on others while I myself is relying on &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301;. You must have been mistaken, Raphael-san is my power after all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am super reassured!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why, I&rsquo;m relying on you.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer. &#12300;Analysis&#12301; result is&hellip;&hellip;. No data.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Huh? What now?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ehhhh, what does that suppose to mean?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does it mean that it didn&rsquo;t see through Clayman&rsquo;s curse?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;No curse spell was discovered. This&mdash;&mdash;&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oi oi oi, that&rsquo;s no casual matter that you can just get away with me calling you useless!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I thought I was unable to analyze because of my lack of focus, but then with all I have put into work now, I still can&rsquo;t break through it. Not only that, it didn&rsquo;t find any curse spell.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raphael-san, you are surprisingly useless in this type of situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is bad, if this continues I&rsquo;ll suffer a horrible death.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My chances of victory against Milim in a toe-to-toe fight is truly low.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case then I don&rsquo;t have any other option. I have to keep Milim trapped with me before Shion and the rest beat Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to continue my confrontation with Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, my own ability has also improved greatly. Even though she has been manipulated and is not fighting with her true abilities, I still can put up a fight with her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it&rsquo;s me in the past, I would have been beaten to the ground in less than a minute.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet I&rsquo;ve been able to hold up the battle with all I have for dozen of minutes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Would it be possible for me to beat her out of her brainwash?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That thought cross my mind, but beating Milim is really against my personal principle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Proposal. Suggest to activate &#12300;Gluttonous King Beezlmuth&#12301; and attack by absorbing magicule.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh? Oh oh? I totally forgot that I can do that!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No time to lose then, let&rsquo;s try it out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll be the one to take damage from a frontal impact, so I need to use dissolving techniques in my offense. I&rsquo;ll use my force from the side to change trajectory of Milim&rsquo;s fists and kicks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then I&rsquo;ll used the interval for &#12300;Gluttonous King Beezlmuth&#12301; to absorb magicule. This seems to be very effective as Milim draws distance from me with annoyance.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The damage caused was minimum, but it would suffice.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Milim&rsquo;s attacks are all protected by her Dragon Aura, that&rsquo;s why the more I engage and absorb her dragon aura, the more stamina I can drain from Milim as it goes. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s hope Shion would defeat Clayman soon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it&rsquo;s another issue whether I could win or not with this continues to repeat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 574.00px; height: 839.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 574.00px; height: 839.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I truly wishes to win I won&rsquo;t be able to reserve any of my power. But I may still lose even to this extent. And even if I win, I&rsquo;d be exposed of my powers in front of the other Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By that time, in terms of the overall situation, I would be the loser.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right considering my status, I can only continue on causing damage and wait for the cursed bond of Milim is removed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hope Shion would finish Clayman sonner.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no way of knowing how much longer the attacks and defense on both side would last.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or rather, I&rsquo;ve been in defense all these times.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I would be taken out if I has a miss. Under such serious circumstance, I was able to continuously dodge most of Milim&rsquo;s attacks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&rsquo;s fist slashes over my right cheek with a low growl.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My mind is not concentrated enough and dodging has become impossible.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If she hits me head on, my body would shatter.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I possess regenerative skill &#12300;Infinite Regeneration&#12301; that surpasses &#12300;Super Regeneration&#12301;, but using it too much would drain my magicule. I would still be able to revive after being shattering by her. But with repetition of this process, I&rsquo;ll be the first one to exhaust my stamina.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I must concentrate, and concentrate more.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I predict Milim&rsquo;s movement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The shape of her right fist suddenly changes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a skill called &#12300;Dragon Tooth&#12301; that has been disguised as her fist.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She threw it over my cheek just like before but unleashes her claw to slash my neck.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is worthy of the name Dragon Tooth, my head would definitely be severed from my body. That&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t dodge this attack, but instead stop it from the side.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim releases her Dragon Tooth while I move my left hand towards the outside to take the hit. I feel the burning sensation on my left hand. The intense energy exploded and my left hand which took on the attack has been gravely injured.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s what happens when I try to stop her attack alone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only a madman would try to launch offense against her directly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The so called power of an overlord is the ability to suppress opponents with just some power applied and form an instant kill skill. That is exactly what I&rsquo;ve been experiencing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, if I don&rsquo;t sacrifice my left hand, I would have suffered a fatal blow afterward. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s fine as it is. But Milim&rsquo;s reckless behaviour is beginning to make me complain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps my complaint has been answered as a heavenly opportunity appears.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, Milim loses balance and throws out her iron fist with her left hand that has been at rest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Good chance!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Warning. It could be a trap&mdash;&mdash;&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the time I made a sound of realization &#12300;AHH!&#12301; in my heart, it&rsquo;s all too late.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The calm analysis from &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; has been thrown behind my head as my attack has already been launched.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was planning to grab onto her left hand and throw her out. Since Milim has lost balance, I thought I could pull a over-shoulder throw on her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, if that was a trap set by Milim&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&rsquo;s left hand suddenly paused as a smirk emerges on her face.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s the expression when you succeed in pulling a trick.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">OHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOO&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now I am in a state of turning in Milim&rsquo;s view with both of my hands reaching out, trying to grab Milim&rsquo;s left hand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can watch my own actions through third-person view by &#12300;Magic Perception&#12301;, what a posture full of openings.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m done. GAME OVER.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Milim swings out her iron fist and is about to score a direct hit on my head&mdash;&mdash;before she could hit, someone barged in between me and Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">DONG!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hear a sound of low blow.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Awoo! How can you suddenly hit people? Isn&rsquo;t that over the line?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A brown-skin blond man appears.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He kinda looks like me&hellip;&hellip;.. Eh, isn&rsquo;t this Veldora?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora is squatting down with his hands wrapped around his head.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It looks pretty painful. But he seems to only been slightly injured by the direct hit of Milim&rsquo;s iron fist, there isn&rsquo;t much to be worried.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh, Veldora, why are you here?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I took the chance and reposition myself and ask Velodra while being on guard against Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wooo, that was super embarrassing.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That doesn&rsquo;t matter, did something happen to the town?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Not really. It&rsquo;s because that Diablo guy has returned so the defense network has become stronger.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What the hell? Did you say that Diablo have come back?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no way the plan to take over Falmas Kingdom is concluded that quickly&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Never mind, right now the focus is on Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Why did you come here for? You can screw off if you just came here to watch a show. Go back at this instant!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru, now you are just being mean&hellip;&hellip;.. Don&rsquo;t worry, I was going to do some real business!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora hands out something seemingly with a sound effect of&#12300;Chang&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;. It&rsquo;s the manga I prepared for him beforehand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora is holding the last volume.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What is this for?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t understand. As a result Veldora becomes indignated and begins to complain to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t you play dumb now! The content doesn&rsquo;t match up with the cover! Are you trying to troll me by tantalizing me at such crucial (plot) point?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, AH&mdash;&mdash;! I recall.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was trying to prank him alright.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he acts nice then I&rsquo;ll give him the sequel. That&rsquo;s the prank with manga I wanted to try lecture him with.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I accidentally left the entire manga series to him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So did Veldora come all the way here to get the sequel&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All the way to this separated battlefield.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the addition of my ultimate skill &#12300;Storm King Veldora&#12301;, I would be able to summon him from &#12300;Infinity Prison&#12301;...... But even without my call, Veldora came regardless.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is another lesson for me today, but right now it matter not whether I&rsquo;ve learnt anything from it or not.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The town is guarded by Diablo now, since Veldora has come, I&rsquo;ll just use him to my advantage.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alight, before I give you the sequel, there is a request I want to make from you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm? What is that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You go ahead and have some fun with Milim over there. But, you must refrain from hurting her.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;MIlim? Oh, that&rsquo;s my brother&rsquo;s only daughter. It&rsquo;s my first time meeting her. I see she&rsquo;s still a child. Fine, I&rsquo;ll handle it!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora agrees with alacrity.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does he want to read the sequel? Or does he have interest in Milim? Either is fine.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s only daughter&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;That line is somewhat discerning, but I&rsquo;ll include it in the meeting after this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&rsquo;s eyes are carefully navigating our side, she also seems interested in Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her eyes are glowing, so it should be fine now if I walk away.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim vs Veldora, I wonder who is stronger. That&rsquo;s indeed intriguing, but at least Veldora is stronger than me, so he must be able to buy some time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t waste a good opportunity like this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that I am free, I&rsquo;ve got to hurry and finish Clayman to end this fight once and for all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now then&mdash;&mdash;How did the situation develop when I was focused on dealing with Milim?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have very little worry for Veldora and Milim, and turned my eyes to Ranga.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since he seems to have encountered the most challenge.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ranga, are you alright?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh oh, Rimuru-sama. I am fine, just a bit troubled.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So there is indeed a situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was wondering why he seems to be restrained during his fight, it would seem that he has difficulty in using his skills.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What&rsquo;s the problem&mdash;&mdash;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was about to ask Ranga when I discover the reason.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Help. Help me. Help me please!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s the weeping sounds of children. They are transmitted in forms of&#12300;Thought&#12301; from the Nine-Head Beast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">White Ape and Moon Rabbit were only trying to protect their scared master.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see, I will rescue you now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ranga, you focus on distracting the White Ape and the Moon Rabbit. Don&rsquo;t let them interfere with me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Understood.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga then focuses on pinning down the White Ape while the other two Tempest Wolves distract the Moon Rabbit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I instead move towards the Nine-Head Beast who&rsquo;s been demonstrating menace to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I approach the poor cub that&rsquo;s been controlled by Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Report. &#12300;Analysis&#12301; result shows&hellip;&hellip;..manipulation cursed spell. Remove spell? YES/NO&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time the curse spell is detected with ease and is successfully removed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be great if this was the same with the analysis on Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It doesn&rsquo;t matter. As soon as I release the cursed bond, Nine-Head beast falls asleep out of exhaustion after a joyful howl. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s quite adorable with how much it resembles a smol animal..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It has three tails with blonde hair, the rest of its body resembles a cute little fox.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga on the side seems to spark a sense of competition upon seeing the scene. I mean, you also have cool and cute characters of your own. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Protect this child.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Understood, master.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I pat Ranga and hand over the little fox to him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that settles with Ranga&rsquo;s opponent.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I then turn to Beretta.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has already finished his battle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta seems delighted as he lies out all the special-grade weapons and armors in a line to polish them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi oi oi! What are you doing?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ahh, Rimuru-sams is here. It&rsquo;s a shame that you didn&rsquo;t see me in action, but I&rsquo;ve prepared all these trophies for you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta bows to me with respect while saying so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The trophies you mean&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The so called finest work of Clayman, Piorra has been dismembered to the extent of miserable to look at. There also seem to be equipments that are gifts for Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have always guessed that Beretta is strong, but I didn&rsquo;t expect him to beat that arsenal looking Majin without a scratch&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And more importantly&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi, Beretta. This may sound pretty harsh, but you seem to have only picked up bad habits from Ramiris!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Woo!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta looks at me in shock, probably. His face is masked but I could tell from his aura.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have to give a advice here. Or else Beretta will forever got tainted by Ramiris&rsquo; horrible habits.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It may just be me thinking too much, but how do you plan to deal with all these trophies?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;A-about that&hellip;&hellip; I want to offer them to Rimuru-sama&hellip;&hellip; I was wondering if by offering these things, you can then provide residence for me and Ramiris-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm? Providing residence&hellip;..?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris has indeed mentioned about wanting to move to our town, why is Beretta supporting her?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Why are you supporting the idea?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;It&rsquo;s because&hellip;&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The content of Beretta&rsquo;s explanation is dumbfounding.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just now he wanted to help us and was forced to pledge his loyalty to one master only by Guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beretta mentioned then that he would be serving Ramiris full-heartedly after assisting me this time. But, Beretta was still once a cunning Demon, so he has already come up with a backup plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Ramiris move to our town, he could then move along as well. If that&rsquo;s the case, he could then help us indirectly through Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These words are almost sophistry yet he says it sounding very justified. His proud and smug look while saying so really resembles the style of a Demon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You&hellip;...Never mind, you truly are more and more like Ramiris!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a compliment, but I am still honored.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s not compliment at all!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seriously, it&rsquo;s only been a while since we last met yet he&rsquo;s become so much more cheeky now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, that&rsquo;s quite the interesting growth style.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll discuss about this later. It won&rsquo;t be that easy to prepare a residence alone, I&rsquo;ll have to consider it more.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes sir, I understand.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Beretta accepted my proposition happily, so that concludes it for now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll consider Beretta&rsquo;s proposition later. I turn around to look at the last person, Shion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right there, the result is about to be revealed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is breathing heavily as he stares at Shion hatefully.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem he has learnt how strong Shion is.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be an understatement to say Clayman seems to have been been getting draws from fighting Shion. That&rsquo;s because Shion has the incredible trump card of &#12300;Super Regeneration&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their powers are on par yet Shion has the upper hand in terms of endurance. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The exchanges between the two seem to be equally matched, but Clayman already seemed tired as I was battling Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion would probably win even without my help.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now Clayman must be anxious seeing Shion has the advantage.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that all you got? Aren&rsquo;t you too weak to call yourself a Demon Lord?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion sure is ruthless.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s totalling despising Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;B-bastard, unforgivable! Go, Dancing Mannequin!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he finishes, Clayman releases five mannequins. They immediately turn into Majins and throw themselves towards Shion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every one of them is a Greater Majin.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman has infused the souls of Majins he has collected with the mannequins in preparation of their immediate manipulation. They are his hidden combat forces.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s no time for him to reserve his forces, so he pulls out all his aces in a go.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These forces are more than enough to defeat normal Majin.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion pulls out her beloved odachi and slashes the five Majins in one hit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How boring. You&rsquo;ve really got nothing interesting.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She says so towards Clayman looking chilled as ever.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She sustained the battle without a scratch.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion actually has more style of a Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the contrary, Clayman begins to shiver and shouts with the expression of having been greatly shamed:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Q-quit joking around, you bastard! It&rsquo;s too early for you to get cocky! My Dancing Mannequins will restore themselves soon and attack you. Now we are doing things seriously!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is not being sour about losing, but there is really that kind of effect in play.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion waits for it without a care, yet the Mannequins have no sign of getting up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is of course a reason for it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;H-how can this&hellip;&hellip; Why aren&rsquo;t they revived?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman mumbles to himself with anxiety in his eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His proud combat force has not gotten back to their feet, causing him to be confused.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since that&rsquo;s the case, I shall explain things for him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Uhh&mdash;&mdash;how troublesome, but I&rsquo;ll tell you. Shion&rsquo;s odachi can consume souls. Did you forget to apply defensive spells for the physical and spiritual resistance of your mannequins? If you are that crude in craftsmanship, of course they would get trashed in one slash.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no point in hiding at this point.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was planning to eat Clayman anyway, so I&rsquo;ll tell what he wants to know.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;T-this knife possesses spiritual attack!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s nothing rare, even the humans are using them.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I-impossible! That&rsquo;s a rare power even among special-grade equipments!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah&mdash;&mdash;right. They are knives made by my people anyway.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve improved Shion&rsquo;s odachi greatly on basis of Hinata&rsquo;s sword. Now it can attack spiritual body.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It isn&rsquo;t really consuming souls, but the knife is able to cause damage to spiritual life form.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Depending on the power applied in her attack, those without resistive power would instantly die, nor does it have the limitation of seven hits. That&rsquo;s why there is no way to confirm whether the enemies are killed or not, but it won&rsquo;t be much of an issue considering Shion doesn&rsquo;t know how to hold back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, it is a combined heavy attack causing both physical and spiritual damages, so you won&rsquo;t even need seven hits to ensure the kill.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Oh, is that so? Then it would be &#12302;Hercules&rsquo; Edge &middot; Ex&#12303; </span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt41" id="ftnt_ref41">[41]</a></sup><span class="c0">!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You didn&rsquo;t know&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Didn&rsquo;t I clarified when briefing with you? Never mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion really is too lazy to memorize such difficult mechanisms, so it was the right call to have improved its function.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Go, gogogo, is that so? You are using the power of that knife to fight me. Then I should claim that annoying knife as well into my collection! Consume it, Superb Demon Lord Domination!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman seems to have misunderstood something.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Creepy beams of black light begin to shoot out of Clayman&rsquo;s hands and they wrap around Shion&rsquo;s body from bottom to top.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion is doing nothing in response.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ehh, you could have dodged that and then finish him off&hellip;&hellip;. Fine then, it doesn&rsquo;t seem necessary.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman might have thought that Shion was too slow to react. He looks rather pleased at this sight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Gogogogogo. You should be happy, this is the ultimate curse spell that can even control Demon Lords! It is quite the waste to use it against Majin like you, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;ll have to reorganize the Five Fingers anyway. Come be my subordinate and be of use to me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is completely mistaken judging by his words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How pathetic, Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion is not rendered unable to move, it&rsquo;s simply that she doesn&rsquo;t want to move.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman has boasted this skill to the roof yet it has had no effect. But perhaps you guys (readers) don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s the case either.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion has obtained the skill &#12300;Perfect Memory&#12301; that can store her memory in her astral body&mdash;&mdash;In simpler terms, it is a special skill that can save memory even when the brain is damaged.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as one retains his conscious soul and memory, he can be revived even when his body is completely damaged. She has become a special species. It won&rsquo;t be too much to call her a semi-spiritual life form.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, she can think with her soul.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That means she has complete immunity against all mind control effects.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Opponents against Shion have can&rsquo;t do anything with domination spells.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi, what are you trying to do with this? I don&rsquo;t even feel a thing, do I have to wait a little longer?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion asks impatiently as she has been wrapped around like a cacoon by the black silk. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve had this thought long ago&hellip;&hellip;. You should really change your pro-wrestler mindset.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why would you intentionally fall into enemies&rsquo; trap in real battles&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whether it is Shion, or Suphia or even Milim, I can&rsquo;t understand this mindset of a battle frenzy. Stop it, get some help.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; explains that Shion is not affected by the skill, so it is unnecessary to be cautious against Clayman&rsquo;s secret technique.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;H-how could this be&hellip;&hellip;.. Why is my Superb Demon Lord Denomination not working? Impossible, there is no such thing! That is the ultimate curse spell that can control even Demon lords!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the spell that controlled the Nine-Head Beast. Indeed, it seems to be able to easily dominate Calamity-level beings, but shouldn&rsquo;t it be useless against Disaster-level Demon Lords?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Clayman is too overconfident with his power.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion then, probably bored of waiting, blows away the black cocoon in an instant with her Youki.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How very boring. You don&rsquo;t deserve to be a Demon Lord when relying on such petit trickery.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion says so with much disdain in her tone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing this, Clayman falls into panic. He freezes on the spot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;No, that&rsquo;s not true.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&rsquo;s words seem to have touch Clayman&rsquo;s nerve.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Gogogo, Gohahahaha&mdash;&mdash;! How dare you say I don&rsquo;t deserve to be Demon Lord? Unforgivable, trash! I&rsquo;ll make you regret this, regret having forced me to use my real power.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He begins to shake his shoulder and laughs out without any care. His laughter sounds desolate.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He then begins to take off all his classy clothes, exposing his upper body. Clayman has secretly carried many gadgets and items, but he doesn&rsquo;t seem interested in using them and scattered them all over the place.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as I thought that things are about to end, it turns out Clayman has kept a hand (four actually) up his sleeve.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After exposing his upper body, two pairs of hands grow out of his back. Those hands look slim and long and are wrapped in black exoskeletons.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s who he truly is&mdash;&mdash;It is a completely different figure from his previous disguise, one that reeks an aura of insanity.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes, of course. Yes, Demon Lord. I am Demon Lord. That&rsquo;s why I care about how I fight. I send my enemies to their graves with elegance and grace. But that&rsquo;s enough. Enough. This feeling, I&rsquo;ve forgotten for too long&hellip;&hellip;. I&rsquo;ll crash you with my hands!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He roars with rage and reveals his true nature.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is holding something, something precious looking.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a mask, a clown mask with the carving of a smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He puts it on without hesitation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh? Now you seem a bit more intrigued. You are beginning to impress me. I am Demon Lord Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s personal secretary Shion. Allow me to be your opponent!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion looks delighted and announces her name to Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman also&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Demon Lord&mdash;&mdash;No, I am &#12302;The Laughing Clown (Crazy Pierrot)&#12303;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt42" id="ftnt_ref42">[42]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Clayman. I&rsquo;ll kill you, Majin Shion!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He responds by announcing his title</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s how they begin their fight at the same time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman with his true self revealed is very strong.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As expected from a Demon Lord, he is approaching Shion with a strong mana. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His natural pair of hands are controlling those ominous black silk beams.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The upper pair of hands on his back hold an axe and a mace while the lower half holds a sword and a shield.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is trying to give Shion a hard time with manipulation of both magical and physical attacks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Shion is stronger.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She waves her odachi named &#12300;Hercules&rsquo; Edge &middot; Ex&#12301; to deflect Clayman&rsquo;s sword and smash through his shield.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her straight swing from up to down also destroyed the defending axe and mace.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">All of these wild strength originates from Shion&rsquo;s unique skill</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt43" id="ftnt_ref43">[43]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#12300;Demonification&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for her almost cheating effect of weapon destruction, it is probably due to&#12300;Decisive Result&#12301; and &#12300;Optimal Action&#12301; from (her skill) &#12300;Chef&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, Clayman is no match against Shion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even with his true strength, Clayman is still beaten to a pulp by Shion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two pairs of iron wrists crossed behind his back are defending against Shion&rsquo;s fists, yet those four hands have been broken. Shion was also able to score a punch right on Clayman&rsquo;s stomach.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WOOOOOOOHHHHHHH&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman seems to be in great pain as he begins to foam from his mouth.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The result is set.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I may sound like I&rsquo;m favouring my subordinate, but Shion has become super strong. She came back from death and obtained far greater strength than before.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;GAPUUUUUUUUUU&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion gives Clayman another kick. He begins to spin on the ground with a depressed expression.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His mask is broken to reveal his bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;.......Im&hellip;..Impo&hellip;...ssible&hellip;...I-I don&rsquo;t believe. I&hellip;...me&hellip;&hellip;.Demon Lord Clayman is&hellip;.!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He finally realizes the difference in strength with his opponent and couldn&rsquo;t accept such reality. Clayman seems out of his mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama, can I take his life?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion asks me now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">About that, though I still have some questions to ask, but I&rsquo;ve guessed about most of his answers. The only thing left is the identity of the man behind the scene, would he answer honestly though?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;D-damnit! Milim, what the hell is Milim doing? That type of trash, go ahead and defeat&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman seems to know his death is imminent and shout in panic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the Milim in his words has been suppressed by Veldora. Suspecting at this point, Clayman looks at Veldora with eyes of witnessing unbelieving scenery&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;W-who are you&hellip;&hellip;..? W-What is this? What is with the incredible power&mdash;&mdash;!!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that he has discovered that Veldora is no ordinary Majin.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Although he may look human, he is actually Veldora. Didn&rsquo;t I just say we are friends?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is speechless.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seems to be denying, but upon seeing how the opponent was able to put up a fight against Milim, he is forced to accept reality.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora has been fighting Milim until now with elegant fighting styles. In between there seem to be shouts of familiar technique names. Milim seems to be reacting quite surprisingly to them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s making me question&mdash;&mdash;whether she is really being manipulated?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;...............&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have some doubts regarding Milim&rsquo;s reaction, but never mind, I&rsquo;ll leave her alone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora seems to be having fun fighting in human form for the first time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is right then, Clayman gave up seeking help from Milim. In the midst of Chaos, he changes his plan to flee to the edge of the battlezone and begins to shout to the outside.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;F-Frey! Frey, what are you doing? We are on the same boat here, come and help me!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman begs for help with he can yet Frey&rsquo;s reaction is extremely cold.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ara, pardon me now, Clayman. I can&rsquo;t enter this &#12302;Barrier&#12303; without Guy&rsquo;s permission. What a shame.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that, she gives such fake response.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman smacks his lip unpleasantly and turns his head towards Milim again.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His eyes twitch frequently as the last bit of sanity within him ceases to exist&mdash;&mdash;he has gone completely mad. It would seem Clayman has come up with some bad idea again. With a crazy smile on his face, his eyes fall on Milim once more.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Goha-GOHAHAHAHA! Milim, oh Milim! Hear my command and activate &#12302;Frenzy Berserk&#12303; ! Go and kill all of these people!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He spills out such frantic words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is no longer caring about his image, he only wishes to live.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh shit, now we are done.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t just sit around and watch anymore. I need to join the battle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet it is then I heard some unbelievable words coming into my ears.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Why would I do that? Rimuru and them are all my friends!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turn back in shock and see Milim smirking and chilling there.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Milim! Wait, aren&rsquo;t you being controlled&hellip;&hellip;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHA&mdash;&mdash;HAHAHA! You seem to have been fooled all this time, Rimuru! How could I be controlled by Clayman?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">N-NANI?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;...............&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">For some reason, &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; started to sound quite angry from just now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I&rsquo;ll ignore it for now, Milim is the focus here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So, are you not controlled by Clayman?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eh&mdash;&mdash;What in the world is going on? I unconsciously tried to double check. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, Milim only gives me a proud smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am not the only person who&rsquo;s confused.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the Demon Lord also said in surprise: &#12300;Eh? Wasn&rsquo;t she just hit, why didn&rsquo;t she react at all?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most surprised person is no more than Clayman himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;R-right. &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo; gave me the &#12302;Dominating Orb&#12303;. It should make you listen to my every order&hellip;&hellip; did you not kill Karion according to my order?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah&mdash;&mdash;nice one Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is too shocked to the point the of not realizing what he is saying.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now the credibility of my evidence footage has also increased.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because not only did Clayman just confess to his crime accidentally, he also exposed that there is someone behind all these.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim responds to him with the following:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, that&rsquo;s it! I wanted to ask about it. Answer me, Clayman. Who exactly is &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She questions sharply without a care. She also completely ignores Clayman&rsquo;s question, that seems like what Milim would do.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If this is the case, it would mean that Milim was never controlled in the first place, and instead has been suspicious towards Clayman from the start.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, why?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before my question could have been answered, another voice arrives to interrupt.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi oi oi, who did you say has died?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the opposite side of the isolated battlezone, a low and charming voice raises its volume.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is from Demon Lord Frey&rsquo;s servant, the man with the giant eagle wings.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hold on a second, could this be&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He really did wear such flawed disguise&mdash;&mdash;! </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now wouldn&rsquo;t that make me the one who didn&rsquo;t realize about it&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;...........&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh no.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; seems dumbfounded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of that. Back then &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; seems to want to say something&hellip;&hellip;. No, I must be thinking too much. Yeah, I&rsquo;m definitely thinking too much.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s forget about this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I need to be more perceptive in the future.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s how I would do it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That man&mdash;&mdash;Karion slowly takes off his mask.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His incredible aura instantly leaks out in its full.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion activates his aura and restore his original appearance in an instant.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lion King (Beast Master)&#12301; Karion &mdash;&mdash; The real deal, there is no way around it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Glad to have you back safe and well, Karion-san.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hey, Rimuru. I&rsquo;m not exactly safe and well, but that doesn&#39;t matter. Thanks for taking care of my subordinates.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are welcome.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion expresses thanks to me and gives off a smile to Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I can confirm that Milim was never controlled.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What, how could this&hellip;&hellip; It would mean, did you really&hellip;&hellip;.? But, Frey said&hellip;&hellip; Oh, so Frey was in it too. Even you betrayed me&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that he has cleared up the story, Clayman stares his eyes at Frey like a madman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, Frey doesn&rsquo;t seem to care one bit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 829.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 602.00px; height: 829.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Considering the situation, rather to say she&rsquo;s betrayed Clayman, it&rsquo;s more like she&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ara? Have you been mistaken all these time about me being your partner?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey says so coldly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, indeed. Women are horrifying.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes indeed, Frey has been lying to Clayman from start to end.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Q-quit&hellip;&hellip;.joking around! Y-you people&hellip;&hellip;. Unforgivable, I won&rsquo;t let you walk free!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, the howling of the sad clown echoes around the room&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shion, do it.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Leave it to me!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I give the order and Shion takes action.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She has been like a starving hound under the order of &#12300;Freeze!&#12301;. Now she has grasped her knife tight to swing it at Clayman with all her strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is going to execute him with the slash of her odachi.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman applies all his defense, yet all three pairs of his hands are severed. He has sustained grave injuries after being slashed open sideway. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&rsquo;s odachi can even destroy one&rsquo;s spirit. That slash put Clayman down to the ground without a sound afterward.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right, now Clayman is out of the scene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion is still alive, so my testimonies are all set.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I won&rsquo;t be treated as enemy by the Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is on the verge of dying.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He isn&rsquo;t posing any threat and is impossible to come up with any plan to reverse his situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The evidences to his crime are all confirmed, now he can&rsquo;t walk free with excuses.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">BEcause he has openly confessed in front of the Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the Demon Lords witnessing all these, they will judge for themselves, yet Clayman has lost all credibility. Now there won&rsquo;t be any Demon Lord trying to defend him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The &#12300;Barrier&#12301; separating the battlezone has been deactivated. Frey walks towards us and then turns straight towards Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I trusted that you won&rsquo;t be manipulated, but I was still quite nervous, MIlim. But, you have followed through our &ldquo;promise&rdquo;, thank you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHAHAHA! Of course I will since we are friends. Right, Frey, have you kept good care of that thing and brought it here?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I did, are you referring to this? Speaking of which, you are even immune towards the dominating orb, you are truly strong&hellip;.. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two continued to exchange as Frey takes out something from her pocket to hand to Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s the Dragon Knuckle I gifted her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim seems delighted and takes the thing as she couldn&rsquo;t wait to put them on.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And a smile blooms on her face.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim and Frey&rsquo;s interactions have all been observed by the Demon Lords. After seeing all these, they&rsquo;ve finally been brought updated to the situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So that was all an act.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I-I saw through it from the start!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s how I guessed things should be.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So that&rsquo;s how it was&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, I overheard many conversations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I shouldn&rsquo;t be the only one who was fooled by Milim, yet in the end everyone acts as if they&rsquo;ve known long ago.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just then, I heard a moan in pain near my foot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;F-from when? How long have you deceived me&hellip;&hellip;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem he&rsquo;s still struggling to grasp his last breath. He couldn&rsquo;t believe this. It was unacceptable to him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim reveals the cruel truth to Clayman on the ground.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, I worked really hard! I made a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; with Frey to pretend being tricked. And I put on the wristband to mislead you into thinking you&rsquo;ve controlled me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;.....Q-quit joking around&hellip;.. That was the Dominating Orb infused with all of my mana&hellip;..highest level&hellip;...most powerful domination curse spell&hellip;..! And how could you&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm! I could resist most of those magics. I deactivated most of my barriers and force myself with my own will to give up resisting&hellip;.. I know you are cautious enough to not believe the curse spell has worked until you see it with you eyes. I was able to make it through in that way!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;W-What did you&hellip;.say? You&hellip;.you let others intentionally cast a curse on you. And even with my highest level magic item&hellip;&hellip; my ultimate technique that can even dominate Demon Lords&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so? But, it would be impossible to dominate me!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">MIlim raises her chest and brags looking all proud.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Seriously, you made me really worried. By the way, your acting was so poor with how you held your fist in the victory pose with smile on your face.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You can&rsquo;t blame me for that. I was really happy seeing Rimuru being angry for me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey shrugs seeing Milim like this. Then she recalls something and says:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, I was so nervous when Clayman beat Milim initially. If Milim had not endured, my home would definitely be destroyed. Your forbearance skill is top notch. That is commendable.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She exposes this regarding the whole incident.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Clayman has beaten Milim more than once. He has hit her more before.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t believe such person even exist, is he trying to commit suicide?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm! Because I am already an adult. An adult who knows how to tolerate!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She emphasizes on the word adult, but she&rsquo;s still just a kid.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No way. Never mind, I won&rsquo;t go after you for it. Besides, did you really endure it just for our agreement? What was your real intention?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Hmm? Nothing really. I just recalled the weird things Clayman said before. He wanted to make Rimuru into an enemy of the humans and plan a war between human and </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">. It won&rsquo;t be fun to let him succeed, that&rsquo;s why I had to interfere!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t expect that you would stand out like this for once&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHAHAHAHA! That&rsquo;s right! I am already an adult!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right right right. I&rsquo;ll take your words for it.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that&rsquo;s how it was&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&rsquo;s sharp instinct has made her notice the people behind that manipulates Clayman. Did she pretend to be manipulated in order to find out the real identity of that person?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She seems to also have made some sort of a deal with Frey, I suppose I&rsquo;ll let the whole deal of fooling me pass.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From this I can conclude that Milim has never once been brainwashed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not that the effect has been deactivated midway through, it has never worked in the first place.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of these have been an act. It&rsquo;s all because Milim was too good at her performance, we can crown her the best actress.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And she even went to the extent of secretly eating pepper in private to maintain her emotionless expression. She has fooled everyone with her natural expression while enduring the horrible taste (of pepper). </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora has seen through her with one glance and played along Milim. He says that he wanted to get familiar with his new body, so he had some fun fighting with Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora seems to have surprisingly high adaptability.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Have you not noticed all these this whole time, Raphael-san?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;..............&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, yes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that I think about it, it&rsquo;s been trying to say something all this time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raphael-san said that there was no result, now that I think about it, it makes perfect sense.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since she was never under the control of any spell.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I misunderstood.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I need to listen more carefully to other people&rsquo;s explanation in the future. I&rsquo;d better form another habit of listening other people&rsquo;s words till they finish.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I reflect secretly on the incident.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Karion comes and stands before Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right, Milim, is it alright for me to ask you something?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm? Sure, ask away!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim answers with a smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is in a good mood with her Dragon Knuckles back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s not a big deal but I want to confirm something&hellip;&hellip;. Were you really not controlled? Does that mean that you were having fun trolling me as well?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion is putting up a smile as veins pop on his forehead.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm, of course he would mind that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Woo! A-about that&hellip;&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ahh, don&rsquo;t be so nervous. It&rsquo;s okay. It was because I was too weak. But, you did trash my country, was that your idea as well?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion didn&rsquo;t even try to hide his anger and asks Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">For an instant, Milim panicked, but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh! Karion, does such insignificant business really matter?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She got mad at him instead.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing this, you know for sure it is Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Insignificant my ass! Seriously, if you had slipped your hands, I would have died!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Heh, annoying, you are so annoying! That&rsquo;s because I was acting too&mdash;&mdash;no, because I was acting so hard to trick Clayman ? That&rsquo;s why it was all Clayman&rsquo;s fault!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi oi oi, don&rsquo;t push all the blame to Clayman now&hellip;&hellip;. Enough. You won&rsquo;t listen anyway if I complain to you&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feel much sympathy for Karion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing Karion&rsquo;s manly face now shed with tears, I have the impulse to go comfort him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was tricked too, so I can understand how he feels.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t be sad, Karion-san. The Beastketeers and the rest are all fine and was able to aveng you. They all worked very hard this time. So things are not all bad.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh oh, Rimuru. Sorry I had to trouble you to comfort me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry. Besides, you can always rebuild your castle. In order to rebuild it, I&rsquo;ve taken captives of Clayman&rsquo;s subordinates and will let those Majins do the work for you guys.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah? Oi oi oi, is it true&hellip;&hellip;.?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Of course it is. We also won&rsquo;t hold back any of our technical support. And assistance is only natural. That&rsquo;s why, let us work together to build a more prestigious, more comfortable kingdom!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have time on our side. I&rsquo;ve also got a bunch of money from Clayman. I was thinking to use it for future trading, right now it would be a good strategy to give out a few favours.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was also thinking to build a good relationship through this operation with our neighbouring Beastmen. Allow me to use this opportunity well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHA&mdash;&mdash;HAHAHA! That&rsquo;s wonderful, Karion. I have also contributed to it!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How did Milim contribute to it at all?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If anything, her contribution is to have wiped out the entire place clean without bricks and stone so the construction work could be conducted more easily.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;My apologies for the trouble, but we are saved! Rimuru&mdash;&mdash;I should call you Rimuru-san. I swear that us Beast Kingdom will maintain a friendly relationship with your country forever, and we will provide you with any assistance!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion was surprised and spoked with gratitudes on his face. Then he turns back to Milim and warned her along:&#12300;I hope you could reflect about all this.&#12301; Milim seems to sense that things have been resolved with fluention and has turned back to her old self.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Should I can her a realist? Never mind, that&rsquo;s more like Milim anyway.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyhow, Karion has regained his spirit, so I&rsquo;ll let things slide.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, it would seem there are more people who are surprised by my words. The Demon Lords surrounding us are also surprised at my speech.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I can&rsquo;t believe there is something like this in life. You let those Majins live, aren&rsquo;t you just too naive&hellip;&hellip; But it&rsquo;s an interesting thought nonetheless. No wonder Noir decided to serve you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Red-Haired Guy says so delightfully.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Noir</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt44" id="ftnt_ref44">[44]</a></sup><span class="c0">? What the hell is that?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Never mind that, I would put aside it to check on Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Neh, Clayman. You have been arrogant against the weak and those who can&rsquo;t resist. I don&rsquo;t think you are qualified as a Demon Lord. I didn&rsquo;t interfere because Milim has endured this whole time&hellip;.. But even I am a little pissed.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey lashes out at him coldly and says so. It means she doesn&rsquo;t plan on saving Clayman, the equivalent of giving him the death sentence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right. Even though this is the natural rule of the survival of the fittest, but Clayman, you really crossed the line this time. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of complaints now that my country has been destroyed.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion as well, he is angry at the fact that his country has been bombarded. Even though the one who did it was Milim, he seems to be pushing the responsibility onto Clayman. He doesn&rsquo;t plan to forgive him. &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy is only watching the show from the side.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rest of the Demon Lords as well, they aren&rsquo;t objecting the punishment towards Clayman. It would seem none of the Demon Lords are in favour of Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then the whole thing is now settled.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What follows it&rsquo;s the &#12300;Clean up job&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman&rsquo;s death is near.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman knows he won&rsquo;t live for long and is troubled by thoughts of regret that have filled his heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he recalls his comrades&rsquo; words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Those words swing around his heart like trotting lamps</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;You&rsquo;ve got to be careful&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Ah ah&hellip;.. Laplace, you were right&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He thought he was cautious enough already, yet he has been blinded by power all these times.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has mistaken Milim&rsquo;s incredible power that he witnessed as something of his own. This has led to the situation now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Just as you thought, from the result now, I&rsquo;ve been played in Milim&rsquo;s palm this whole time. I thought I took every step with caution&hellip;&hellip;. Yet I was played by Milim. You guys gave me the seat of Demon Lord because of trust, yet I could only make it to today&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When he ignored his friends&rsquo; advice, he was already destined to end up in this fate.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such thoughts keep revolving in Clayman&rsquo;s head.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Clayman, you are not as strong as us, don&rsquo;t you go act all stubborn on your own!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;He&mdash;&mdash;Hehehe. Tear is right. Come and find us if you need help.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Ah ah, Tear. Ah ah, Footman. Yeah. I forgot to&hellip;....</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has always placed his dignity with too much importance and never wanted to rely on his companions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, he has always relied on his companions, yet he threw that idea behind his head at such crucial point of time. That was really uncalled for.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">I wanted to become strong just like you guys. Shouldn&rsquo;t it be natural to be stubborn and strike for it? Because I am a member of the Moderate Clown Troupe after all&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman hopes to receive recognition from his companions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He hopes they would recognize his power, that&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t involve the Moderate Clown Troupe to his schemes. It was truly Clayman&rsquo;s miscalculation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, it is all too late&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;He recalls the first time he met &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hey, are you Clayman?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Who are you? How dare you call my name like that, do you have a death wish?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi oi oi, you don&rsquo;t have to raise your guard like that. I got here because of someone&rsquo;s recommendation.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Recommendation?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah. The one recommending was your boss, Demon Lord Kazaream.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What did you say?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman was planning to kill this young man, yet he has called out a memorable name&mdash;&mdash;Kazaream. That&rsquo;s when Clayman began to have interest in hearing the young man to speak.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he learnt something.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He learnt his ambition and his abilities.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s how it is. I must control this world. Come and assist me in doing so, Clayman?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;He-hehahahaha. Interesting, is this perhaps a request?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes. A request for the &#12302;Moderate Clown Troupe&#12303;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;And the reward?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;To revive Demon Lord Kazaream, how about it?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This reward is more than he could ask for, so there was no reason to turn it down.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He knew what the young man is capable of and recognized the plan to be feasible. There was nothing to doubt.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman made up his mind then to take on the contract.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I know you will take it. Let us collaborate in taking this world into our pocket. When the time comes, we can all live in this world happily ever after!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo; wishing to turn the world into a game to enjoy its fun, Clayman believes such idea may come true one day.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They must overcome layers of obstacles. But it is precisely because of that this task seemed so fun.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He thought so originally, yet now his misstep has costed the entire plan to foil.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was rare already that the reward has been paid&mdash;&mdash;Demon Lord Kazaream was successfully revived&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">My carelessness has led things to this point today. Then, I won&rsquo;t even have ground to excuse myself&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kazaream went through all the trouble to be revived, yet Clayman couldn&rsquo;t even find a chance to congratulate him now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is all his own doing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was ordered to stay put, yet Clayman has acted on his own and ignored the order.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At last, he thought of that man&rsquo;s words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The wise words from Clayman&rsquo;s respected and beloved Demon Lord Kazaream.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Clayman. You and I are a lot like each other, so it&rsquo;s fine to set me as your model, but never ever inherit my shortcomings as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He should have thought about that long ago. That was the motto he deemed as truth.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Ah ah&hellip;&hellip;. Kazaream-sama&hellip;.. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ve forgotten your advice and made the fatal misstep&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, Clayman has taken the wrong move and made the worst choices.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like Demon Lord Kazaream, he has lost to a new Demon Lord, inherited his trait of doing stupid things.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is karma.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the miscalculation that Clayman hated the most.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">I couldn&rsquo;t even save the army you borrowed me, I&rsquo;ve lost them because of my miscalculation&hellip;&hellip; I can&rsquo;t die, not just yet. I won&rsquo;t forgive myself to die without any legacy like this&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As things have progressed, he at least needs to spread out the intelligences he gathered from his enemies. This has prompted an idea to rise in the heart of the desperate and almost given up Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;You the Undead Elf created through my body, but I&rsquo;ve done the most work on your head. Unlike Footman and Tear, you are not suitable for combat. However, you are the only one who would take the role of strategizing and commanding the army. That&rsquo;s why Clayman, you should be the Demon Lord&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has let down Demon Lord Kazaream&rsquo;s expectation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he didn&rsquo;t have enough power, he would only need to acquire it. Then, he would be on the same ground with Footman and Tear. No, he would surpass them in strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once Clayman who&rsquo;s quick in the head acquires power, he would excel more than them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Right, that&rsquo;s it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I can&rsquo;t awake to become True Demon Lord. That&rsquo;s why, please grant me power. Grant me power&hellip;&hellip;. Grant me the invincible power&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Confirmed. Transforming souls to magicule&hellip;&hellip;...Successful. Beginning decomposition to produce vessel of flesh, reconstructing&mdash;&mdash;&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman didn&rsquo;t expect his wish to come ture. Yet the &#12300;Voice of the World&#12301; has answered to Clayman&rsquo;s request.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under such desperate circumstance, Clayman&rsquo;s wishes came true.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">God (Veldanava kek) has not forsaken me!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman has already answered himself in heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">&mdash;&mdash;Go-gogogo&hellip;&hellip; These people have always looked down on me, I&rsquo;ll have them pay for it. But, right now no matter how I need to get out&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though Clayman has weakened to the point of not capable of making sounds, his spirit still possesses a fighting will.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is the bright flame that is the fire of life.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even so&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Opposite to how he thinks, Clayman has remained calm and decided to retreat from the location first.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are several ancient Demon Lords here, and among them Guy, Milim and Dagruel are the most difficult to deal with. He won&rsquo;t be able to best them after just awakening, so it&rsquo;s more important for him to act cautiously now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To report to &ldquo;That Lord&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s his priority.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has previously underestimated the power of the Slime, and his Majin subordinate alone was stronger than Clayman. Not only so, he has also forged a friendship with the revived Veldora. This along cannot be overlooked.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It couldn&rsquo;t have been a coincidence that he was able to survive the duel with that Hinata.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He must throw away his own opinions and analyze calmly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Clayman has decided to retreat with this information.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has drafted his plan with the condition of retrieving these intels.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would use all his power to launch a Giant Magic Missile and flee during the chaotic situation created by the magic missile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Must be careful about Guy, but&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy is not interested in the weak, that&rsquo;s why Clayman thinks he won&rsquo;t care about himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">&mdash;&mdash;It&rsquo;s alright, I can make it out of here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman makes such judgement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would even benefit more if the missile is to affect the surrounding crowds&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With these thoughts, Clayman climbs up.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under the gazes of all the Demon Lords, I was probably the first one to notice his movement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since I have been keeping my guard and staring at Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Get away from there now, Shion!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She immediately reacts to my order and backs up to my side. Quickly afterward, the location Shion stood on was affected as a giant magicule storm begins to swirl around Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The storm has been absorbing more magicule from the surrounding towards Clayman. Had I gave the order a little later, Shion would have suffered its damage.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Look like he&rsquo;s getting serious now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama? What is going on&hellip;..?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion asks me immediately, but she seems reassured seeing I am composed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is nothing to be panicked about, but even though I won&rsquo;t panic&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Clayman has awakened. Just as I predicted.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It is really just as you have predicted, then I am reassured!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion completely trusts me, but I still feel somewhat uneased.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything is moving according to the plan of&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is it really okay? It would be embarrassing if I lose at this point&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I initially saw Clayman, I saw a group of evil objects chasing behind his soul.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those things may be called the spirits of resentment. Clayman has killed many people to this day, those are the remains of their souls.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">They have not merged with Clayman. They won&rsquo;t ascend to heaven nor will they dissipate into the atmosphere. Even with Clayman killed, they would only disappear along with him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was thinking about how to utilize them when &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; proposed an attack plan.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is to push Clayman into a desperate spot and catalyze his awakening.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Proposal. Utilize &#12300;Gluttonous King Beezlmuth&#12301; to &#12300;Prey&#12301; on Clayman&rsquo;s awaken power. This can make up for the consumed magicule.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; said it as if it&rsquo;s so easy, yet there are many problems hindering it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s uncertain whether Clayman would indeed awaken or not. But he would definitely become stronger after awakening.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, about that? Would Clayman fall asleep as he begins to evolve into Demon Lord?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Answer. Clayman&rsquo;s evolution was not achieved through proper procedures, he is able to achieve complete evolution. Thus, predict he will not enter a state of dormancy.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem that its prediction of Clayman&rsquo;s increase in strength would be limited. But regardless I would need to beat the awakened Clayman anyway.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to the prediction of&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301;, no matter how strong is Clayman becomes, I would still easily defeat him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The strength of the body, acquired power, and possible acquired skills&mdash;&mdash;With all of these taken into the simulation to produce prediction and with his threat level set to the highest, &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; still arrives at the result that I would be the winner.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no use worrying, I have to confront him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Besides, it is true as well that my magicule is about to drain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reload speed of my speed is super fast as well and I can instantly replenish myself after a large scale magic spell. But honestly, it&rsquo;s still a long way from filling my mana full.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so I&rsquo;ve still got more mana than that before my awakening, yet without my notice I&rsquo;ve been using up the fuel tank provided by Veldora. Of course then I would want to replenish my magicule.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, I want to demonstrate to the Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am the newcomer, I have to win the throne of Demon Lord with my own strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can only gain the approval of the Demon Lords by demonstrating my power like this, so there may be less trouble in the future. In order to prevent any other Demon Lords to mess with me, it is best to have them be on guard against me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to prevent further trouble in the future, I&rsquo;ll use the awakened Clayman to demonstrate my strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With my power&mdash;&mdash;Ultimate skill &#12300;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi, Rimuru! Did you say Clayman has awakened? Although it&rsquo;s unbelievable, but that power is truly incredible. Let me to assist you now&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, Karion-san. I&rsquo;ll deal with this guy. I&rsquo;ve claimed myself to be a Demon Lord, I want to get my position with my own strength. I&rsquo;m going to eliminate this guy to gain the approval of everyone.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With my words, Karion has to step back.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t lose to him.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He cheers for me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I won&rsquo;t lose.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My only motivation now is to take down my enemy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, I am the angriest person here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Come on, Clayman. Let us see who&rsquo;s stronger.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, Clayman climbs up as I walk in front him myself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other Demon Lords seem to decide to continue to observe.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone seems fine with me fighting alone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right, they must have made no objection hoping to see my true strength.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim laughs delightfully while Ramiris doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about the situation. Both probably thinks I won&rsquo;t lose.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll consider them to be confident in me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shion, Ranga, step back.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Leave it to me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Understood!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Then I wish you emerge victorious in your conquest, Rimuru-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Lords take a step back along with Shion and the rest. Now this won&rsquo;t affect the others.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing that there is only me left, Clayman shows a small smile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehehe-HEHAHAHAHAHA&mdash;&mdash;! See, I&rsquo;ve got the power! How dare you be so cocky you trash! Now, it&rsquo;s my turn. I&rsquo;m gonna crash you!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His laughter turns into guffaw as he looks at me with disdain. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, he&rsquo;s only putting on an act.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sad thing is, Clayman&rsquo;s actions have all been predicted by &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; mentioned, it has predicted the two possible actions Clayman may take.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would either charge at me to kill me without the fear of death, or he can pretend to look down on me with the hope of distracting me and escape.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is clearly the latter.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Clayman would probably take the actions of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His words are full of frivolousness yet his eyes show cautiousness. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is trying to find any of my opening.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve decided to play along him as his ploy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Didn&rsquo;t I just say? You have nowhere to run. I am stronger than you. Give up your struggle and tell me the identity of the person giving the command behind you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is me acting, but my truthful words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps because of my sincerity, Clayman took the bait without a doubt.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hehehe, how arrogant of you indeed. Let me show you my power&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman continues his act smoothly and suddenly decides to take action.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Believing that I&rsquo;ve let down my guard, he launches a Giant Magic Missile.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He must have accumulated that during our conversation. He has infused all of his power after awakening and fire the incredibly powerful Giant Magic Missile at me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman predicts that I would dodge it. He may even have made other predictions, believing I would use my attack to counter the magic missile, but he probably thinks that it is impossible to stop a magic missile that&rsquo;s suddenly launched.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I dodge the attack, he would then activate the explosive missile mid-air. If I come up with a way to counter it, he would also be able to escape during the explosion of the magic missile&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s likely how Clayman has planned his great scheme.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">*smacks lips* What a shame.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I told you that you are done. This type of attack is useless. Projectile attack won&rsquo;t hurt me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I activate &#12300;Gluttonous King Beezelmuth&#12301; and &#12300;Prey&#12301; at Clayman&rsquo;s Gigantic Magic Missile alongside the surrounding space.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that it won&rsquo;t even affect the surrounding. Clayman&rsquo;s plan has been completely destroyed by me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Nani!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is both shocked and confused.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And with the interval I snap my finger to produce a clear sound.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In an instant, a wall of &#12300;Barrier&#12301; emerges to separate me and Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is now an isolated battlezone. I borrowed it from Guy&rsquo;s construction spell to recreate one.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 582.00px; height: 819.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image18.png" style="width: 582.00px; height: 819.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How dare he steal my technique, what a shameless guy.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy mumbles so while looking intrigued, it&rsquo;s great that he doesn&rsquo;t seem mad about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I can eat Clayman with much reassurance.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My conscience would probably feel bad having such idea. With these ideas, I seem to be adapting a mindset more and more akin to the bad guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Is it because I am a </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that I&rsquo;m not against eating Clayman?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or could it be because I&rsquo;ve become a Demon Lord?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Never mind, anything goes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;W-What is this? What is happening&hellip;&hellip;?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman cannot hide his shock in mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The attack he prides on vanished in an instant, his mind probably couldn&rsquo;t even process that in time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I&rsquo;ve told you several times, you are done.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you tried to fight against me with your level of strength, the result has already been set.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How much power do I have and how much does my opponent have, it is very important for one to recognize that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi, if you want to show your true power then be quick about it. I&rsquo;ll wait. Or perhaps, are you planning to fool around and flee away with that attack just now?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I ask despite knowing the answer myself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Humans are horrible. But since I&rsquo;m slime and not human, so it won&rsquo;t matter.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Compared to that, Clayman is still underestimating me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has kept guard against me, but it&rsquo;s not enough.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; predicted, Clayman&rsquo;s awakening is not that good.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His magicule has increased by a lot, but that&rsquo;s about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He hasn&rsquo;t mastered the mana to control the magicule nor did he acquire any applicable skill.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though he seems to have awakened, his condition compared to me is still earth and heaven.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can accelerate my perception speed a million times more with &#12300;Thought Acceleration&#12301; and the time seems to have frozen. I could also build my spell under this condition so any magic would be activated right after the thought of it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it would be very inefficient to be applied for Magic Missile that requires the gathering of Youki around me, that&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t utilize it under such circumstance.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s unlike the construction of spell that relies on consciousness&mdash;&mdash;that is information. The gathering of Youki would cost some time, but it is only natural.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">However, that&rsquo;s because I have &#12300;Chant Exemption&#12301; and &#12300;All of All&#12301;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how long the magic would take to launch, the million-time extended body sensation of time would always help cast the magic instantly. After all, a second under the skill is equal to two hundred and seventy-seven hours.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how large the scale is the spell, it would not cost more than a day, so any spell I cast wouldn&rsquo;t cost more than zero point one second to come in effect.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for normal magic, it would be a piece of cake to cast several spells at the same time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why, if I am Clayman, I would have casted several different magics to cause a chaos at the scene before utilizing the chance to escape.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman did not resort to this reflects that his power is insufficient.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t even notice that I&rsquo;ve set up the isolated battlezone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that Clayman&rsquo;s escape route has been cut by me, he will have to defeat me before he could escape.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m not sure if he has sensed the bad situation he is in, but the his aura begins to alter.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;He-HEHEHE, a miserable slime, how arrogant. You are indeed strong, I&rsquo;ll admit it. But this is not all my power!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He charges towards me without a care&mdash;&mdash;a change of plan to walk the other path we predicted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has given up escaping and decided to showcase his own abilities in front of the other Demon Lords. It&rsquo;s a gamble with a low rate of win. To the Demon Lords &#12300;Power is everything.&#12301;, it would be possible for them to forgive his crime if he is strong enough.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But first, he need to defeat me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You seem quite confident in your control of Youki, but will you be able to take this? Eat this, my strongest ultimate! Dragon Pulse Death Canon!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Clayman has spoken a lot to distract me while trying to manipulate the pulse of earth</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt47" id="ftnt_ref47">[47]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and surrounded network around me and release them all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Youki gathered around the ground with the addition of his own magicule allows the pulse of earth to be transformed into beams of disturbance effect to attack the enemy&mdash;&mdash;This is the principle of Dragon Pulse Death Canon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whoever affected by the skill would have their sequence of magicule disturbed and cause internal damages. It is immune to physical defense and it may even shoot through and destroy&#12300;Barrier&#12301; that is formed by magicule. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">It is a surge of power that can be called the </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Buster, truly something worthy of the style of Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it won&rsquo;t work on me at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I shall consume them all, &#12302;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&#12303;&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beams projected from Dragon Pulse Death Canon rises from the ground like a flying dragon. However, now these dragons seem to be howling in dismay before their death as they being absorbed into a twisted space before they could even reach me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Impossible to escape.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The scenery is as if they have encountered the gravitational force of a black hole that even light cannot escape.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s no use, Clayman. You are weaker than me.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I must break his psyche.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this way, he may give out the man behind the scene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fear is the best weapon to break one&rsquo;s mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Impossible&hellip;..How can this be possible&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! That was m-my ultimate technique!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not important whether it is your ultimate technique or not, because projectile attacks won&rsquo;t work on me. If he puts in more thoughts and attacks me head-on, it may be a different case.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Now do you know that you have no chance to win? Then I&rsquo;ll ask you something. Give me all the information you have and give me the names of your helpers. If you confess honestly, I&rsquo;ll give you a quicker death.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;HEHAHAHAHA! I am an undead elf, I&rsquo;ll revive even if I am killed by you today, I&rsquo;ll just find another day to kill you&mdash;&mdash;OUCH!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I start to hit him with my hands.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I continuously hit him hard without a word.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, I apply &#12300;Thought Acceleration&#12301; on Clayman and accelerated his mind a million times more. My &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; not only would contribute to me, it can also affect other people.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In terms of the time in the real world, it has only been a few seconds.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But to Clayman, his sensation has lasted for dozens of days, filled with the taste of fear and pain of being continuously beaten by others.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He needs to remember this fear and pain with his soul.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few more seconds pass on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman&rsquo;s hair has fallen off due to fear, his face turns to one that resembles a ghoul.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Clayman.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I call him calmly. And Clayman suddenly shakes and his entire body freezes out of fear.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ll ask you one more time. Who leaked the message to you? What&rsquo;s his relationship with you? Tell me and I&rsquo;ll give you a quick one.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although I&rsquo;ve asked, Clayman turns out to be more tenacious than I expected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;D-don&rsquo;t underestimate me. I won&rsquo;t betray my companions, nor will I sell out my contractor. T-this is the iron law of &#12302;Moderate Clown Troupe&#12303;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is that so? So even the villains have their principles and that is non-negotiable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so, then don&rsquo;t blame me. Yeah, I&rsquo;ll let you in on this, you are not going to revive.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I say so to Clayman as if it&rsquo;s nothing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was shouting about getting revived, but it would be impossible.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once you are eaten by my &#12300;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&#12301;, you will end up in a worse fate than being trapped in the &#12300;Infinity Prison&#12301; that even Veldora can&rsquo;t escape.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;W-What? What the hell are you talking about?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Could it be that he has been so stubborn because he still has hope of being revived?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing my words, Clayman panicked.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You just said it. Didn&rsquo;t you say undead elf would revive even after death. That&rsquo;s why you want me to kill you so you can escape by releasing your astral body. Am I right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This guy is really cunning, and it&rsquo;s impressive how he would resort to anything in order to achieve his goal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman&rsquo;s face suddenly turns blue.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;W-What are you saying?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He tries his hardest to play dumb, but that simply confirms my doubt.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t even need &#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; to spot such a thing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, Raphael-san is indeed strong.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Let&rsquo;s see, you can attach your astral body with the pulse of earth to preserve your consciousness and memory, am I right? That&rsquo;s why you won&rsquo;t really die even with your body destroyed. That&rsquo;s why you want to fake your death&hellip;..&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see, so that&rsquo;s how it is.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">I directly read out the explanation of&#12300;Wisdom King Raphael&#12301; . Clayman begins to shiver as a result, it seems that I&rsquo;ve guessed right on the spot.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;W-wait&hellip;&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that I know the reason behind it, it&rsquo;s about time to finish this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright, it seems I won&rsquo;t be able to get more information by questioning him. I&rsquo;m going to execute Clayman now. Is there any objection? If you want to object, I can take on you for a round!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I ignore Clayman who wants to say something and ask the Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be problematic if someone objects, but there is probably none.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Do what you wish.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As expected, Guy spoke on behalf of everyone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other Demon Lords seem to be fine with it as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Stop! Don&rsquo;t do this, STOP IT&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman begins to shout like a madman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has realized at this point that he can&rsquo;t escape.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You&rsquo;ve made a big mess for me, that pisses me off. Don&rsquo;t you think you are getting a quick death now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said, I place my hand on Clayman&rsquo;s head.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he is willing to give me the identity of the man behind all these, I was going to give him a quick one. But Clayman didn&rsquo;t talk. In the long term, I need those information, but I suppose it&rsquo;s fine if I don&rsquo;t get it now, I&rsquo;ll see to it in the future.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps Clayman has hidden some clues in his castle. I&rsquo;ve heard from witness &nbsp;that &#12300;Moderate Clown Troupes&#12301; are not all Majins, they are clearly collaborating with humans.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now I don&rsquo;t know whether it is Eastern Empire or the Western Nations. Either side is fine. Since they know my movement, they must also have eyes in the Western Nations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Slowly and surely, I would catch on their tail. If I get testimony that can not be verified from Clayman, it may do the opposite effect and mess with me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why, Clayman&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;There&rsquo;s still a little more time before your soul is destroyed completely. Before that, you should take you time to reflect.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;</span><span class="c23">NO! HEY, STOP IT! DON&rsquo;T DO THIS! STOP IT&mdash;&mdash;! H-HELP ME, FOOTMAN! HELP ME, TEAR! I CAN&rsquo;T DIE YET. CAN&rsquo;T DIE HERE&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!</span><span class="c0">&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman seems to still be looking for ways to escape, he looks rather embarrassing like that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, I won&rsquo;t let him go.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter what he do now, I won&rsquo;t be moved. Letting someone like him go would be burying seed of catastrophe.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, thanks to you, I&rsquo;m not that naive anymore. I&rsquo;m not gonna lose my companion again because of my naive ideas.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;</span><span class="c23">P-PLEASE HELP ME, KAZARAEM-SAMA&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c0">&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman reaches towards his broken mask, hold onto it and pray&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shua&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman with his ugly shouting, his struggle and resistance suddenly disappear in front of me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has been consumed by my &#12300;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&#12301; with not even his soul remaining.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is being transformed to pure magicule in my body. In the process, Clayman would taste the suffering pain as if he is in hell.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whether you are a filthy soul, evil soul or evil kind soul, none can avoid it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All are equal before death.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that moment I suddenly hear&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Ah, Laplace. You were right. I crossed the line. I should have followed to your advice and stayed put&hellip;&hellip;..You view was always right&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;I seem to have heard Clayman&rsquo;s voice.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is he confessing?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So even this type of man of extreme evil would also confess&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hope Clayman would more or less reflect himself with my gift of &#12300;Death&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>

		<p class="c11 c10"><span class="c4 c15">Eight-Star Demon Lords</span></p>
		<hr>
		<p class="c11 c10 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as I finish consuming Clayman, the red-hair Demon Lord stands up from his seat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He then begins to speak with much majesticity. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Nicely done. I will approve you to use the title of Demon Lord in the future. Any objection?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any objection. It looks like they&rsquo;ve all recognized me as a Demon Lord now. Now I can be reassured.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Honestly, it would be a suicidal act to try taking the hostile stance against the rest of the Demon Lords around here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, those concerns seem to be unnecessary.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I disengaged from the battlefield and Ramiris approaches by flying to talk to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I knew Rimuru could do it when he gets serious! That&rsquo;s why I told you, I&rsquo;ll allow you to study under me in the future&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh, I&rsquo;ll pass, you can find student somewhere else.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Why? Why does it matter? Just be my student (underling), pretty please.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris starts to complain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Milim responds to her proudly:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Fufu! Rimuru is my besties. He doesn&rsquo;t seem willing to get along with you now!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehh? You must be kidding, Oi! Rimuru, that isn&rsquo;t true, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHAHAHA! You&rsquo;ve been elbowed out by me, Ramiris! &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What did you just say&mdash;&mdash;! Then check this out!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&#39;s deliberate provoke was successful, leading Ramiris to throw a flying kick to Milim&rsquo;s face.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim laughs delightfully as she casually dodges the kick.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two seem surprisingly close.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without my notice, Veldora began to chat to Demon Lord Dagruel intimately.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seems to be showing off by discussing about his current training of surpassing aura.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He even points at me while saying &#12300;You see that, Dagruel? That&rsquo;s the best example.&#12301;, looking all smug.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel replies &#12300;Indeed. It was only for a short while but I felt it dearly. The burst of magicule is impactful. Yet he concealed it so perfectly.&#12301;, as such, in agreement with Dagruel.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora seemed to have acted as the live commentator for me during my battle against Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">please stop doing this and spare me the trouble. It is because I know you would have done such things that I wanted you to stay at home&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dino seems to have lost interest once the battle was over and says dizzily:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh well, that&rsquo;s cool I guess.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He simply throws out a line like that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Demon Lord is quite hard to see through and I have no idea what&rsquo;s on his mind. But at least he seems to recognize me as well, that should do.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon on the other hand acts as if it is none of his business. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh, I&rsquo;m not interested in whoever becomes Demon Lord. You guys can do whatever you want.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What a cold guy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey and Karion don&rsquo;t seem object either.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Which means, there&rsquo;s only one person left&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, the previously silent Demon Lord Valentine takes a heavy step forward.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh, a lowly slime wants to be Demon Lord. I would never agree to that&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Valentine looks down to me with arrogance and said so to me in a glaring tone like an emperor.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems he&rsquo;s voted against me. However, by the system of majority votes, I&rsquo;m positive that most of the Demon Lords here have approved of me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then there won&rsquo;t be a problem&mdash;&mdash;I thought so and decide to ignore him.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Ga&mdash;&mdash;HAHAHA. Silly brat, how dare you insult my friend? Oi, Milus</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt48" id="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup><span class="c0">, your underling is quite rude to his superior, should I teach him a lesson for you?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora said so to Valentine&rsquo;s maid without hesitation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eh, OI! What are you doing, mister??</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What do you mean by that? I&rsquo;m just a loyal maid to Demon Lord Valentine-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her voice is cold, cold as her expression&mdash;&mdash;as Milus responds to Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hey, you can&rsquo;t do that! Valentine&rsquo;s been hiding her true identity, Veldora, you shouldn&rsquo;t expose other people like that!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eh, Milim-san? Aren&rsquo;t you the one who&rsquo;s exposing other people?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was already skeptical about it before and it would seem my guess was correct.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The beautiful girl wearing maid suit, Milus, is the real Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her sights alone now could kill. That is the type of stare Milus is giving Milim right now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ahh!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim seems to have realized and begins to awkwardly whisper, trying to muddle through.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 551.00px; height: 808.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image23.png" style="width: 551.00px; height: 808.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You aren&rsquo;t even whispering out any sounds. Plus, it&rsquo;s no use for you to do something like that now. Milus doesn&#39;t seem to be the joking type, you probably can&rsquo;t have her forgive you after doing something like that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milus menacingly glares around her surrounding.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her eyes tell that she wishes to kill everyone present to dispose of &nbsp;the witnesses.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She seems like the aggressive and dangerous type. But luckily Milus decides to give up the idea so as to not make her a public enemy here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Gee, you blasted evil dragon, ruining my</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt49" id="ftnt_ref49">[49]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;work every single time&hellip;&hellip; Also, did you even forget my real name? You sure are irritating. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milus&mdash;&mdash;no, Demon Lord Valentine says so with her intimidating aura unleashed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora sure is casual, even remembering other people&rsquo;s name wrong. That probably have provoked Valentine even more. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Enough. You may call me Valentine.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Valentine announces so with much displeasure. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Immediately after, she releases an immense amount of magic and changes her appearance instantly. Her maid suit disappears, and instead it was replaced with a luxurious black gothic dress.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s magical dress change&mdash;&mdash;The quick clothes change magic that MIlim is also good at.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And a girl with heavenly beauty appears before us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, of course. The real deal is indeed different.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The male Valentine is rather strong too, but the difference between the two is heaven and earth. The Demon Lord with both beauty and power thus enters the scene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Roy, you can go back first.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Valentine displays the style of a king and orders the current Demon Lord Valentine after her dress change. It would seem that the Demon Lord valentine here is called Roy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But, Valentine-sama&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;There&rsquo;s no point in keep acting now after &nbsp;we&rsquo;ve been exposed in front of so many people.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Valentine asserts so while staring at Veldora. Veldora is looking all awkward and mumbling &nbsp;&#12300;It&rsquo;s not my fault, none of my business&hellip;.&#12301;and tries to avoid eye contact with Valentine. These are barely excuses.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the one who started all this, Milim, has it out of her mind completely now. To Milim, that&rsquo;s likely just a past event. Her habit of doing whatever she wants really can&rsquo;t be changed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she probably knows better than anyone that Valentine, apart from her rage, has no intention to extend her complaints any further.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now she&rsquo;s changed her mood and gave some strict orders to Roy, who now is simply an underling:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Besides, there&rsquo;s something on my mind right now. That guy Clayman has laid eyes on you, and his vision was freezed for a second. This may have something to do with the pest that invaded our territory. Go back and inform everyone to stay on guard.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She says so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to her, it would seem then Clayman has been meddling in other people&rsquo;s business all this time. No wonder he is disliked so much.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps he&rsquo;s just trying to find out more about the unknown domain of Valentine, what a reckless guy. Such love for information collecting is playing with fire.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Understood.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After his response, Roy leaves alone to return to his country.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t disobey Valentine&rsquo;s order. This means that Roy has little reluctance for the seat of Demon Lord and was indeed just a body-double.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This also shows the authority wielded by the real Valentine.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, Valentine returns to the her Demon Lord throne once more. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now let&rsquo;s restore everything to normal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I take out the round table from &#12300;Stomach&#12301;and place it properly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the right call to absorb it to protect it from breaking. If we had broken out fighting without such preparation in the fighting area, it would definitely damage the table. It looks quite expensive so I have no intention to compensate for breaking it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Lords return to the round table while the two maids working for Guy begin to serve everyone with red tea.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon, slanting his eyes at the scene suddenly speaks:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;ah, now I recall. The name Kazaream sounds awfully familiar. It was the Demon Lord that I killed.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I almost spit out the red tea I just drank.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could Leon just suddenly say that in monotone without a single bit of emotion?!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Do you know him, Leon?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How come YOU don&rsquo;t know about him, Milim-san?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rest of the Demon Lords have a similar reaction to hers.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who&rsquo;s that supposed to be? The majority think so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Ramiris has completely forgotten about him. Don&rsquo;t you have any memory to those things? I want to tease her about that, but I digress out of pity.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;So where did the name Kazaream come from?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;...... Answer. Clayman just called out to a number of people. One of the name was &#12300;Kazaream&#12301;.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh yeah! Now I recall.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Which other name did he call out now&hellip; Just to clarify, I remember everything very clearly, please don&rsquo;t treat me as the likes of Milim and Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So what would be the relationship between this Kazaream and Clayman?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I attempted to ask and got an answer from Karion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Kazaream was the &#12302;Cursed King&#12303;. Milim, didn&rsquo;t you and Kazaream recommend me to become a Demon Lord?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, it&rsquo;s that guy. I remember there was a &#12302;Cursed King&#12303;. Right, he&rsquo;s the Demon Lord that Leon killed.&#12301;. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She can&rsquo;t remember the name but still recalls the title. That&rsquo;s somewhat acceptable I guess.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that&rsquo;s the only Demon Lord Leon has beaten. But in my view, she must have forgotten because it is unimportant&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Yeah, I remember Kazaream was an Undead Elf</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt50" id="ftnt_ref50">[50]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;just like Clayman. And it&rsquo;s the mutated species of elves that evolved through their own efforts. I used to have some connection with him in private and heard that Clayman took over Kazaream&rsquo;s territory. From that we can infer the two are connected secretly.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion reminiscents of the past and turns to tell me that. It seems Karion thinks Kazaream is not as bad as Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wow, right, wait a second? I almost skipped through that, but since Kazaream is also undead elf...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Could it be that Kazaream is still alive? Did he pretend to be killed by Leon and in reality, have hidden himself somewhere else?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hmm, that guy is capable of that indeed. Kazaream, he&rsquo;s a much more difficult guy to deal with than Clayman. He is a smart man.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion agrees to my view, so I think it&rsquo;s likely the case.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You say it as if I had intentionally let him slip. Unbelievable. He used to proclaim so arrogantly that he will assist me to become a Demon Lord one day as long as I serve under his reign. I didn&rsquo;t even bother to refuse and simplu took his place by defeating. Whether he&rsquo;s dead or alive now is none of my concern.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon says so without any shame.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I suppose Leon just wanted to show his strength instead of actually killing Kazaream. That&rsquo;s why he doesn&rsquo;t care about his status now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi oi oi, Leon. It must be because this kind of attitude of yours that Clayman hated you so much.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh, I&rsquo;m not interested.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karioin decides to advise Leon but was met with a cold answer. But it probably would only trouble Leon more.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of which, I didn&rsquo;t know Clayman was working against Leon as well, he sure had a lot of enemies. Is he really a smart guy? I become more and more skeptical. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if that&rsquo;s the case, I seem to have a rough idea of what Kazaream and Clayman&rsquo;s plan is.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I heard that it&rsquo;s been around two hundred years since Leon become a Demon Lord, and apart from helping Karion and Clayman becoming Demon Lord, Kazaream likely wanted to have more companions within the Demon Lord rank.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is probably for that reason that Clayman carried out the plan to turn orc lord into a Demon Lord. It is to have more people to help out and have more of a presence during the Banquet.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This type of idea of creating big group of comrade seems to be quite scummy and isn&rsquo;t appropriate for a Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it is indeed an effective plan, so I could understand..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Among Clayman&rsquo;s companions, there is an organization called &#12302;The Moderate Clown Troupe&#12303;. They seem to receive assistance from humans and it&rsquo;s likely the revived Kazaream has possessed onto some human.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I begin to explain my theory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Having been defeated by Leon, Kazaream&rsquo;s body seemed to have been destroyed. This is why in order to revive himself, it must start with his astral body.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that was the case, he would naturally want to possess onto other living being.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, if he had revived in the resident area of other Demon Lords, he would have been discovered immediately. Kazaream, who has yet to be discovered till this day, must have hid somewhere other than the domains of Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Maybe that&rsquo;s the case. Leon&rsquo;s attack could even destroy spiritual body. It&rsquo;s rather commendable that Kazaream was even able to figure out a way to survive. Moreover, it would take several hundred years&rsquo; time for even us, the Demon race, to revive from our soul form. It&rsquo;s definitely worse for Undead Elf. So it&rsquo;s unlikely that he was able to revive himself with his own strength. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy surprisingly agrees to my view.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike spiritual life form such as Demon race, the Undead relies on flesh. This is why the revival of his astral body requires a lot of time. It&rsquo;s a miracle that he was even able to survive.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is Guy&rsquo;s explanation summarized.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, it&rsquo;s highly possible that someone has been assisting him</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there isn&rsquo;t any reliable source of information regarding these connections behind the scene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Anyhow, we&rsquo;ll leave it like this for now. Regardless, we must assume now that Kazaream has been revived. Stay on alert. Clayman has been killed, so I would think he will probably hate me a lot.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHAHAHAHA! Rimuru, you are quite strong, so don&rsquo;t worry about it!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Idiot! Don&rsquo;t you know you will get defeated for being so careless!?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim suddenly replies as I spoke.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a way I responded so to serve as a reminder for myself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our grand victory today wiped out all of Clayman&rsquo;s forces, so I&rsquo;d think the enemies won&rsquo;t take any action any time soon. But I can&rsquo;t get careless now. It&rsquo;s fine if they go after me alone, but right now I have companions to take care of.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I need to put more thoughts into defense in the future and draft some response strategies.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The short break ended with the meeting once again held.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman who was previously the host of meeting has now been forcefully retired. So Guy took his place and host the meeting. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Our topic of discussion today is the betrayal of Karion and the rise of the Rimuru guy over there. And all these issues have been resolved. Karion never betrayed us and Rimuru has shown power worthy of the role of Demon Lord. I think the meeting is done so far. But since it&rsquo;s a rather rare occasion, does anyone have any suggestion to make?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey begins to speak, seemingly awaiting that line.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Could you allow me to speak for a moment? Right now we are during the middle of our meeting, so I have a suggestion to make, or rather, a request to make, I suppose.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Fair enough, have at you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing Guy has approved, Frey nods and proceeds:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;From today onward, I&rsquo;ve decided to follow Milim&rsquo;s rule. Based on that, I would like to give out my seat as a Demon Lord.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such it&rsquo;s the big shocker she just tossed out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi oi oi, why are you saying this all of a sudden?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wait, Frey! How come I never heard you mention about this?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed, I&rsquo;ve kept silent. But, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it for sometime now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey squeezes her eyes and drifts afar as she speaks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey recalls to herself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was talking to Milim then. Their conversation made Frey determine to have faith in Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Let me ask you this, Frey. Would you like to be my friend?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Why do you ask that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Because I made a friend like Rimuru! Friends are really amazing, they help each other out all the time.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Well now, is that so? About that, Milim&hellip;&hellip; If you are willing to help me, I would like to be your friend then.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Really! Then I will definitely agree to you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Haha, that&rsquo;s pleasing. However, I am rather cautious. So if you are willing to follow a &ldquo;promise&rdquo;, then I&rsquo;ll trust you.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright I know! Then we can be friends together!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey doesn&rsquo;t trust Clayman, that&rsquo;s why she chose to believe Milim. She gets to keep herself safe while pretending to have accepted Clayman&rsquo;s advice.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Milim didn&rsquo;t follow the promise, had she actually been manipulated&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although she feels unease, Frey decided to gamble on Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so in the end, it was her victory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is the reason.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason why Frey decides to put her faith in Milim and follow her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This lone and arrogant Queen has not trusted anyone before, and this is the first time she entrusts herself to any individual.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey seems to have recalled something and had a chuckle about it. Then, she announces with determination:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Anyhow, there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons for why. But the most important one of them is that I feel like I am too weak to be a Demon Lord. After witnessing that battle just now, I was further convinced. If I am to fight against Clayman, I could barely manage to make it a draw in the end. Not to add that Clayman became awakened mid-fight, so there&rsquo;s no way I could have won...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;But Frey, aren&rsquo;t you good at high-speed aerial combat? Is there really a need to look down on yourself like that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel tries to defend her, but Frey seems already determined.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed, I&rsquo;m more advantageous in aerial combat. But that&rsquo;s no excuse for not being a Demon Lord. Moreover, I know it&rsquo;s not enough to just have some advantages&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon saying so, Frey peeks at me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then she proceeds with the words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;So, that&rsquo;s why I decided to work under Milim. Besides, Milim can&rsquo;t always act so stubborn, right? She needs to learn how to run her own territory now, shouldn&rsquo;t she?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That means Frey isn&rsquo;t saying so just for her own sake.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim is indeed a dangerous individual that can&rsquo;t be let loose on her own. There needs to be someone who can assist her and watch over her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey understands her short-coming. But in my view, she&rsquo;s not as weak as she describes. It can be said that she is a different type of strategist from Clayman, one whose ideas can&rsquo;t be seen through. It&rsquo;s quite terrifying when you think about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In anyhow, she is the typical type of person that let you go &ldquo;women are terrifying&rdquo;. I suppose that&rsquo;s why I feel she&rsquo;s particularly scary.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But what would really happen if that&rsquo;s the case (Frey serving Milim)?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If she is no longer a Demon Lord but proceeds as a servant. Her combat ability is undoubtedly worthy of Milim. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no recognized nation under Milim&rsquo;s name, but would she now possess territory once Frey becomes her subordinate?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the time comes for me to build an alliance with Milim&rsquo;s country, the engagement may be complicated with Frey&rsquo;s involvement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or rather, it would be more interesting that way.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So, do you accept my proposition?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey looks towards Milim as she continues her speech.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;B-but, I don&rsquo;t give out visas&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as she attempts to reject the proposition&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hold your horses. I&rsquo;ve got something to say about this as well.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With such statement, Karion joins in their conversation,</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I, too, has lost to Milim during a duel. I think life is all about being straightforward, so I want to surrender to her. In terms of our titles, the Demon Lords have the same place. It&rsquo;s a different case when fighting against a Chosen Hero, But now I&rsquo;ve lost to another Demon Lord, so I ought to step down. Which means there&rsquo;s no excuse for me to keep being a Demon Lord. That&rsquo;s why now I&rsquo;ll be Milim&rsquo;s subordinate from now on. Please take care of me, BOSS! &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This one just decides to straight up ignore her personal will.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I understand that power is everything to all the Demon Lords, but this is just&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim doesn&rsquo;t take any subordinate and so she won&rsquo;t get objection from them. But now suddenly two current Demon Lords fall under her reign, how does that even make any sense?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wait a second, Karion! The duel thing was all Clayman&rsquo;s doing! I was manipulated, I&rsquo;ve got nothing to do with that!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s just quibble.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t think excuse like that would work, Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other Demon Lords are also looking at her, dumbfounded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hey now, stop lying. You did just say &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to manipulate me!&rdquo;, and you said it so confidently!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion&rsquo;s impersonation is really on point and was able to reenact Milim&rsquo;s words. I&rsquo;m surprised he turns out to be so talented.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hm? T-that, that was...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s okay, don&rsquo;t mind that idiot who&rsquo;s all brawn and no brain, you will take me in right, Milim?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Y-you are saying that hoping to trick me, right? Becoming my minister or </span><span class="c4">underling</span><span class="c0">, and you won&rsquo;t talk to me like an equal again, right? And you won&rsquo;t play with me or do pranks with me either. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey shakes her head hearing Milim&rsquo;s words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s not true. We get to be together forever in that way. And we get to do more fun things together.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She begins to brainwash Milim with such things&mdash;&mdash;Trying to instigate her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see, it&rsquo;s this type of things that makes you cautious around her.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for Karion, he does have a strong personal style and cuts to the trace:</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Bottom line is, it&rsquo;s all because you&rsquo;ve trashed my kingdom to shreds! Rimuru-san promised to helps us, but you&rsquo;d also have the duty to take care of us.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t think that type of duty exist, but Milim seems to be clueless against this type of logic. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion, is surprisingly witty.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim seems to have taken Karion&rsquo;s words for it and almost fainted. But then she bursts out as if she doesn&rsquo;t want to care about any of this anymore.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So ANNOYING&mdash;&mdash;! Alight, alright, whatever you guys want!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Smoke begins to flow out from Milim&rsquo;s head like the eruption of a volcano. Milim.exe has stopped working.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sasuga Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She seems smart but never actually uses her brain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Karion, do you really wish to do that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Of course. I&rsquo;ve thought through a lot already. I don&rsquo;t intend to retire from being the king of the beast kingdom. I merely wish to pursue Milim and build up a new system.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion gave a simple and clear answer to Guy&rsquo;s question.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I was rather fond of you. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll also awake given another couple hundred years and I was looking forward to it.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy sighs through his nose and says so with disappointment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he immediately switches to a smile and announces.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Very well! From now on, Frey and Karion are no longer Demon Lords. You two can go server Milim as you desire.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Guy&rsquo;s words out, the two are officially released from the duty of Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one present seem to object.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And of course, I&rsquo;m none the wiser.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, I&rsquo;ve officially been approved and inaugurated as Demon Lord. I eliminated another one alongside with the retirement of two other, who decided to be Milim&rsquo;s subordinates.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Ten Great Demon Lords are now Eight Great Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And just as I thought the meeting is over, there seems to be another issue to resolve in the end.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said it without much care and started the whole ordeal.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh yeah, so it&rsquo;s not Ten Great Demon Lords anymore.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This quickly sparked responses from all the Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s quite annoying indeed. It&rsquo;s a matter of prestige, so we&rsquo;ve got to come up with a new title.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel says so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eh? Is it really that important?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Glad that the banquet has yet to be dismissed. Now that all the Demon Lords are gathered, we may come up with some good ideas.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Valentine who doesn&rsquo;t take jokes lightly begins to follow with a serious expression.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oi oi oi, we don&rsquo;t need to be that cautious with something like titles.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if we let it slide, the humans will definitely make up names for us by themselves.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We&rsquo;ve gone drained our brain doing this last time. Everytime we decide to change our name the number of members just keep fluctuating. And then several banquets just pass with no result&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ehhhh! Did you guys seriously hold the Banquet just for some boring trivia like that?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I recall Ramiris was being exaggerated when she mentioned that the banquet is a special meeting that all Demon Lords must attend&hellip;&hellip; that doesn&rsquo;t seem right, or is it just simply a tea party in the beginning.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feel whatever changes would be okay.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yeah, like the last title &#12302;Ten Great Demon Lords&#12303; was in the end how the humans call us. We wasted so much brain cells just trying to come up with a name. So leave me out of this one, I&rsquo;ve got no more strength to spare&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No no no, whether you can do it is a different thing..You are just too lazy to think at all.So stop saying that as if you&rsquo;ve gone through much serious contemplations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Quite, people. All you&rsquo;ve been doing is complaining. There isn&rsquo;t anything constructive at all!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What do you mean by that Valentine. You sure talk the talk when you push all the work to Roy.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Valentines says so which resonates with me, yet it was countered with a single line from Dino. Unlike Milim or Ramiris, this lazy bone here has sharp words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But why would it cost so much time just trying to come up with a name. Or rather, they seem all so pumped up by it, could the Demon Lords be really bored in life?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After asking around I learnt that it took them several years to settle for a name last time. But as they were halfway through, the humans began to call them &#12300;Ten Great Demon Lords&#12301;. Thus the Demon Lords in favour of naming drastically decrease. As long as they can come up with a good name, they seem to be fine with moderating the number of Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so they decided to use the title officially, but not everyone was fine with how it sounded.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s one nonchalant info.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You guys need to calm down now. It is time like this we need to show some comradery to sail through difficult times together, unlike how we usually behave. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy was straight to the point about their lack of unity in most days.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris begins to mumble to herself hearing Guy&rsquo;s word.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh, but&hellip;. This time is, Eight Great&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though she says so, her mumbling dies down under the immense silent pressure exerted by the rest of the crowd.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">She then restarted with something else: &#12300;Ah yes. What a great speech by Guy! Let&rsquo;s work hard together now!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone seems to be against the title Eight Great Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, this is not a symbol of unity.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHAHAHA! I&rsquo;ll leave this task to you!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;m tired, time for bed.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It didn&rsquo;t take long before the unfitting bunch starts to appear one by one.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I should have guessed that, they are Demon Lords indeed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;d say it would be an impossible mission to unite them all, and my guess was right.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, someone suddenly appeared to break this awkward atmosphere.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This brainlet of a man now stands right behind me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh? If that&rsquo;s the issue, my friend Rimuru is pretty good at it!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s Veldora.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora who has started to feel bored and wanted to go back soon, said this out of nowhere.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">OH NOO, the Demon Lords&rsquo; eyes now have all fixated on .me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why don&rsquo;t you go read you damn manga instead of spilling nonsense here. But, could it be that he has finished all his manga? Even the last volume?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim has her eyes locked on Veldora, no, Veldora&rsquo;s mangas in his hands. Those eyes are sharper than those of eagles&rsquo; when locking on prey, causing me to feel a lot of unease.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it&rsquo;s not the time to worry about that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Someone agreeing with Veldora appears.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s Ramiris.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Speaking of that, he also named my Beretta super fast!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now she&rsquo;s tossed me the hot potato with all those nonsense.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This girl&hellip;.. She&rsquo;s getting more and more casual with me. It vaguely reflects a sense of dependence she&rsquo;s growing towards me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">While I turn unconsciously, the rest of the Demon Lords are also looking at me with expectation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is bad. I&rsquo;ve been surrounded!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Lords exchange looks and Guy stands up to speak in everyone&rsquo;s name.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru, the newly risen Demon Lord, today I shall grant you an epic special privilege.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, no thanks. I don&rsquo;t need that.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I attempt to cut him up as soon as possible. However, my imaginations were too naive. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chong-dong! As I hear the loud noise, The giant round table that reflects with textures of obsidian and looks quite expensive is now severed in half with by someone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy ignores my rejection with a smile and continues:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Of course you need it, the privilege to create a new title for us. This is of great honor, you must really want to accept it, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He walks towards me casually and proclaims to me and fondles my cheek.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is this some sort of flighty display to ask for a favour?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he looks gentle like water, his tone sounds irrefusable.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am speechless. Neither could I accept nor could I reject, so I decide to exercise my rights to remain silence, however&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy starts to pushing against my cheek hard with his fingers, while biting my ears and whispers: &#12300;By the way, aren&rsquo;t you the way causing our layoffs of members today? You will take responsibility and help think up a name now, won&rsquo;t you?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It may seem to the rest is some lover wanting to get spoiled, but it&rsquo;s not the case at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a threat!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alas, I couldn&rsquo;t refuse anyway considering how everything went.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t believe how troublesome this has become.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Never mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Alright, alright. Gosh. Then don&rsquo;t complain later that you don&rsquo;t like the name I make.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I took the task with much unwillingness after giving up struggling.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Lords are all with smiling faces as if saying &#12300;That&rsquo;s great, now we are reassured.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some people even ask for more tea and decide to rest from then on. They always like to push their work to other people.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fine then, I won&rsquo;t care about them either.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are eight Demon Lords in total, so Eight Great Demon Lord is okay&hellip;. But, it seems a bit too straight forward.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whatever Ramiris was just about to say is probably Eight Great Demon Lords, so I&rsquo;d refrain from using that. After all, you could feel the immense pressure emitted from the rest of the group, telling her to stop. I definitely won&rsquo;t make it now if I get those threatening stares.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So &ldquo;Eight Great Demon Lords&rdquo; is a no go.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of which, tonight is the new moon.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The shining stars in the night sky are very pretty&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How about &#12302;Eight-Star Demon Lords&#12303;(Octagram)? You can say it&rsquo;s an inspiration from Eight awn star&#12290;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said, a period of silence dawns the scene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Lords all begin to close their eyes and think over these words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, everyone opens up their eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That would be it, it sounds very nice.&#12301;</span></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We can definitely win with this name! A new age has arrived!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right! I know Rimuru could do it!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You sure knows your stuff. As expected from candidate nominated by Veldora.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, sounds alright. Then I shall agree with you a little.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You got it in an instance! That&rsquo;s pretty cool. I don&rsquo;t know why we wasted so much time on this last time.&#12301;</span></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;......Hmm *</span><span class="c4 c8">Dino Approval Sound</span><span class="c0">*.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any objection.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s great. And if anyone would like to object, I&rsquo;ll have him think of a name.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although I don&rsquo;t know who Milim is trying compete with or win. It&rsquo;s a bit concerning but I won&rsquo;t go after it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also Dino, I want to ask you what the blaze were you all discussing before&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of the people here&rsquo;s reaction raises a lot of question for me, but I manage to play dumb like an adult to make it through.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash; In total, eight members as mentioned above.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">From today onward, the new age of Demon Lords has arrived.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But first, we need to divide territory.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My domain would be the entirety of Jura Great Forest.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s a nice treatment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, Milim got it better.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The combined territory of Frey, Karion and Clayman is now under Milim&rsquo;s control.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she only rules it in name.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The inner work of the territory would be runned by Karion, Frey and the Worshippers of Dragon who follow Milim.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, the previous territory belonged to Clayman now falls in the buffer zone with the territory of eastern empire. They must investigate how he has runned it and built up defense line.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That seems to be a difficult and time, labour-consuming job. However, that would be Milim&rsquo;s worries.I&rsquo;d rather prioritize my works at hand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rest of the Demon Lords&rsquo; territory remain the same.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of which simply wanders around without territory, some of which hides their territory, or lives in a different continent. As such, no one really knows about other people&rsquo;s territory, and thus there&rsquo;s no notion of changing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">These Demon Lords all act according to their wishes and have their own means of communication.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The &#12300;Ring&#12301;I received as the proof of being a Demon Lord, not only can it identifies the person itself, it is able to make &#12300;Cross-Spacetime Communication &#12301;with other Demon Lords.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It even has the secret call function for individuals, and also the ability to make a group call. What a convenient magical item.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With this ring&mdash;&mdash;Demon Lord&rsquo;s ring, you can even make call from &#12300;Infinite Prison&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since it&rsquo;s so convenient, I would like to put it in &#12300;Analysis&#12301;and mass produce it. But that would be a secret.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Clayman&rsquo;s conspiracy&mdash;&mdash;the series of unrest within the Jura Forest, these are all finally settled. I&rsquo;ve gained approval and become a new Demon Lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although Clayman&rsquo;s master&mdash;&mdash;Kazaream does raise concern for me, the issues regarding the Demon Lords are at last resolved.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;As such, I&rsquo;ve become a member of the Octagram.</span></p>

		<p class="c11 c10"><span class="c15 c4">The Holy Land</span></p>
		<hr>
		<p class="c11 c10 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought I was dead for sure&mdash;&mdash;bearing this in mind, Laplace tries to escape with everything he&rsquo;s got.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to the plan, once the banquet begins, he would attempt to invade the holy land. He was planning to go to infiltrate the &#12300;Inner sanctum&#12301;where he last encountered the demon lord. Laplace headed towards the interior of the holy church, however&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He encountered the person he least wanted to see.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the strongest beauty &#12300;Head of knights of the pope&rsquo;s Imperial guards&#12301;and the commander of the Holy Knight Order, Hinata Sakaguchi.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">What the hell! How did this happen, this isn&rsquo;t going as he promised at all!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace complains in heart about his employer who&rsquo;s not present.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all the promise and meetings, the employer decided to take care of distracting Hinata by asking her out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ahaha, sorry, sorry! He seems to hear the casual apologies of his employer. This is clearly a hallucination, but Laplace is still pissed about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even so, this is no time to complain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How dare you infiltrate such holy residence, you pests surely are annoying.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace got scared almost to death hearing Hinata spitting out that line cold-bloodedly. He escaped without hesitation and was able to save his ass.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could he be motivated at all to explore the &#12300;Inner sanctum&#12301;, the mission was a failure.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, it&rsquo;s not Laplace&rsquo;s fault.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">And just when I thought demon lord Valentine is out&hellip;. I won&rsquo;t stand a chance if that woman is guarding the place&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;How the hell I am supposed to win against that type of monster&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace mumbles, he&rsquo;s already given up and decided to retreat.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of which&hellip;&hellip;. Laplace thinks to himself&mdash;&mdash; I&rsquo;ve been running away a lot lately.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am good enough to be able to escape from Hinata&mdash;&mdash;he wants to praise himself that, but he still feels rather conflicted. Lately his luck has been on the down side, so he&rsquo;d better not get cocky now and thinks he&rsquo;d be able to escape&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace&rsquo;s thoughts was paused at that moment when he senses a strong shockwave of magic while seeing a distortion of space outside in the surrounding of Ruberios. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ehhh&hellip;..no..way&hellip;&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m dead&mdash;&mdash;Laplace wants to cry.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whatever is causing the phenomenon is already far beyond the realm of higher majin, it&rsquo;s clearly a powerful individual on a different level. Moreover, Laplace is somewhat familiar with that wavelength. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Trash, how dare you show yourself before me again!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rage of Demon Lord Valentine burn, his furious shouts spread all around Laplace.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Damn it! And now we get a demon lord!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the worst, Laplace wants to exclaim out loud for his misfortune. But right now, there&rsquo;s no time for such things. He again braces himself to escape with all he has.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh! You trashes are all the same. Why are you all so fond of running away?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;At that instant, Laplace is bestranged by the words of Valentine. He stops his footstep..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What do you mean by that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Huh, it&rsquo;s none of your business, but I&rsquo;ll tell you anyway. Just now, Demon Lord Clayman is dead. That moronic, treacherous trash is just like you, running around with his tails tucked. He even cried embarrassingly in the end.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Valentine spitted out the line, unimpressed and mockingly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hahaha, why are you getting so pumped up about it? This is none of your business, right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Shut your mouth! Oi, you said Clayman is dead, is it true?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ha&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;HAHAHA! Trash, now you&rsquo;ve slipped up. Of course you are all in this together. Everything is as Ruminas-sama predicted!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace is frozen in shock watching Valentine laughed out loud.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clayman is dead, he can&rsquo;t quite process that for the moment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not exactly impossible to believe, but he&rsquo;s not willing to do that. To Laplace, Clayman may be a bit psycho at times, but he&rsquo;s still his companion who shares the same dream and ambition, more importantly, a good friend to Laplace.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;What are you laughing at, you bastard!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Trash, who do you think&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. Guwu&mdash;&mdash;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;YOU SONUVABITCH! STOP LAUGHING AT MY FRIEND!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beaten to death with bare hands.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That would be the words most suited to describe the scene. Laplace&rsquo;s fists did not stop for an instant.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Wuu, don&rsquo;t get all cocky now, you trash!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Valentine&rsquo;s face started to turn red due to the anger and humiliation, shouting and staring at Laplace.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The opponent it&rsquo;s Valentine who possesses &#12300;Ultraspeed regeneration&#12301;, no matter how you beat me it won&rsquo;t work at all. The fools must be punished and killed. Valentine thinks to himself.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He unconsciously rubs away the blood that has splashed out, no, he was turning the blood into a red mist of blood fog, spreading it to the surrounding&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Go to hell, &#12302;Blood Flash Shock Wave&#12303;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Being trapped in the inescapable blood barrier, the blood beam fired towards Laplace who is impossible to escape&mdash;&mdash;Yet it didn&rsquo;t go as he wished.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s futile, you are already dead.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Wuu!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Valentine couldn&rsquo;t react in time. He, who possesses immense power is being played by such low life trash. He planned on using his strongest skill to take his life, yet strangely, his ability is not activated. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tonight is indeed the night of new moon, it is the day when Valentine has the least amount of power. But it matters very little when you&rsquo;ve reached a level such as demon lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps the weakening didn&rsquo;t really have a impact. Then, there is only one logical explanation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace is very strong.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That explanation is quite correct indeed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace is holding something in his hand, something that is still beating.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;&mdash;&mdash;Wuu!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s right, this is your heart (core) that I hold in my hand. You can&rsquo;t move now, can&rsquo;t even make a sound, right? This is all my work. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He announces that cruelly.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknowingly, Valentine&rsquo;s body starts to tremble. Almost if&hellip;..</span></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Is, is this fear? Am I afraid?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;You are rather late to realize that. Yeah, I&rsquo;m pretty strong.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Color begins to fade on Valentine&rsquo;s face and he begins to show a desperate expression.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What Laplace is holding is indeed my heart&mdash;&mdash;Valentine realizes that in shock and realizes his defeat. Seeing the expression on his opponent, Laplace begins to laugh hysterically and smashes the heart into bits.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The victory has been settled.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace won&rsquo;t stop laughing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Ah ah, Footman is gonna be pissed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He laughs as he kills off all the guards who discovered him. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Ah ah, Tear is definitely gonna cry.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He bears his head deep and attempts to escape.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s why, I&rsquo;m going to laugh.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He thinks &#12300;You are one big dumbass&#12301;, this is Laplace&rsquo;s teasing of Clayman.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because he thinks, that&rsquo;s the best way to send off &#12300;The Laughing Clown&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He won&rsquo;t be angry and won&rsquo;t cry.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He will laugh in place of his friend who can no longer laugh. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laplace laughs.</span></p>

		<p class="c11 c10 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c11 c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 314.00px; height: 448.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 314.00px; height: 448.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
		<p class="c11 c10 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A certain location holds a small journal &mdash;&mdash;&#12300;Rimuru&rsquo;s Notebook&#12301;, which was considered a valuable document with records of events regarding that period of time (refer to volume 5).</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But among experts, whether the artifact is authentic or forged has been a famous controversy even to this day.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there is good reason for it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">~Everyone was all happy about the fact that I have awoken by evolving into a demon lord. Since they decided to turn this day into a holiday in Tempest State, I&rsquo;d best record everyone&rsquo;s status before I forget~</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This document&mdash;&mdash;records of&#12300;Tempest Resurrection Festival&#12301;documented in&#12300;Rimuru&rsquo;s Notebook&#12301;begins as such.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a dominating demon lord, it has a rather casual writing style, almost like a handnote to record whatever entered his mind.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The continuation of it will also be things added to the narrative whenever he feels like so, expressing feelings no different than us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What would you feel after reading this?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps you would also feel a sense of care towards the demon lord.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s exactly the type of reaction I hope to get</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since there&rsquo;s no need to continue this tangent, I will now introduce you to its content.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">~It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;Dong~Dong~Dong&rdquo;, but </span><span class="c4 c8">Slash, Pierce, Roll</span><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those are the sounds of Shion cooking</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What horrifying travesty lies beyond the kitchen door&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cooking. </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The word echoes in the void like atmosphere.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I look towards Benimaru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">His face has turned blue. His menacing aura is nowhere to be found.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s as if he has given up everything, like a criminal about to be executed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m just gonna let Benimaru sit here while I (attempt) leave in silence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ri-Rimuru-sama. This is ve-very dangerous, isn&rsquo;t it now&mdash;&mdash;Eh, AHH! He ran away!!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru ran after me with tears in his eyes.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Damn, it would seem I&rsquo;ve been noticed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That being said, it&rsquo;s equally horrifying to just sit there and wait for Shion to finish cooking.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Do you want to come along?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Please allow me to accompany you!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t even have to listen to what comes next.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;d rather go check on the smiles of the ones being resurrected with Benimaru just to forget about our imminent death sentence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I walk out of the kitchen, I receive appreciation from my subordinates who noticed me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone passes on the good news with smiles on their face.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, one by one we exchanged greets over time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And after that, we visited Kurobee&rsquo;s workshop.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We saw Hakuro there as well</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tonight everyone will dine together&mdash;&mdash;That is, a feast will be held. It would seem he has come to deliver the message.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Kurobee has been spending most of his time alone in the workshop, I decided to invite him and later introduce him to the new-comers. But that seems to be unnecessary.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are people who do care for Kurobee besides us.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feel a sense of joy for that even though it was to be expected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I decide to take the opportunity to chat with Kurobee a bit more.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Thanks to Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s evolution, I also gained some abilities. With these, I am planning to update everyone&rsquo;s weapon. Since Rimuru-sama has now proclaimed to be a demon lord, there will probably be more armed conflicts in the future.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kurobee smiles and says such words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Truly a reliable man.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem Kurobee has gained Unique Skill &#12302;Godly Craftsman&#12303; on the basis of &#12302;Researcher&#12303;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That symbolizes Kurobee&rsquo;s resolve, he will put his heart and soul into producing armaments.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve come to have him check on my sword. On top of that, in order to reflect upon the miscalculations with regards to the Falmas invasion, I have decided to retrain everyone. So, in order to be better equipped to respond to all sorts of situations, I asked him to make more varieties of weapons&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hakuro points to all sorts of bizarre weapons on the wall as he says so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are scythes that would be wielded by grim reaper[1] and two-handed great-swords; There are also more common weapons such as sword breakers[2], axes and spears.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for weapons requiring more techniques to wield, there are poles, bladed knuckles and nunchakus.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">There is even weapons as hard to wield as </span><span class="c4 c8">kusarigamas</span><span class="c0">[3]</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem he really has decided to pass on all his weapon techniques in order to cope with all situations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of which&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I want to craft a kitchen knife for Shion, could you help to make it?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Of course, Shion just wouldn&rsquo;t let go of her odachi so it&rsquo;s just about the right timing. While she holds onto a kitchen knife, I would be able to improve on her odachi.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;m relying on you. Also, you should also add on her blade&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I told my ideas to Kurobee, he also expresses interest in the modification.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I was explaining, Hakuro passed me a glass of wine and somehow a drinking session started without me noticing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And because of that, I began to loosen up and give out all kinds of weapon proposals.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most of them probably would turn out to be the results of fantasy and difficult to be of any practical use.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though I won&rsquo;t get drunk, it still warrants myself to reflect the fact that I can lose myself in good atmosphere.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru was also participating in the weapon upgrade &nbsp;and handed his Tachi to Kurobee.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it&rsquo;s an issue of whether Kurobee is gonna able to remember anything after getting sober. Oh well, that&rsquo;s his problem.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We proceeded to the town square after leaving the workshop.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There, the people are working non-stop for the feast preparation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Among them, we encountered a party that&rsquo;s gearing up to leave the town.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, Rimuru-sama! Congratulations on your evolution! I also feel like getting a bit stronger after that!&#12301; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh, Gobuta. That would be pretty good. Speaking of which, there&rsquo;s a feast tonight so where are you heading to now?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ahhh, I&rsquo;ve been asked by Shuna-sama to visit the sea&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Aha?! The sea!?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobuta is heading to the seaside to collect fish for the feast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The last we visited the sea, the fish we brought back was made into sashimi. It would seem she asked Gobuta to help bring the top-tier goods, so they&rsquo;ve decided to bring it back to the table.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s not it, rather say I&rsquo;m being requested to go&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;A second, Gobuta-san. If you continue this, it probably won&rsquo;t end well.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Y-Yes. That&rsquo;s it, we&rsquo;ll be back soon!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobuta stopped just before announcing whatever he was going to say after hearing his second-in-command&rsquo;s reminder.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mah, it is understood without saying.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna&rsquo;s request, rather to be called a request, it&rsquo;s more of a forceful command.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Someone like Gobuta wouldn&rsquo;t be able to resist that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ok, I&rsquo;ll be looking forward to that. Catch something big to bring back!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#12300;Understood. Leave the rest to us!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that being said, Gobuta is pretty fond of fishing regardless.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I bear some regrets in not being able to prepare the feast with everyone. However, collecting the ingredients for the main course is an important task to hand to Gobuta.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He probably feels pretty happy in his heart despite the complaints.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Gobuta prepared to leave, there came another person holding a bag dripping blood.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Due to the distinct swell of the bag, its dangling weight and smell make the us to feel dizzy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned to see who it was, and it turned out to be Gobuzo.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So it&rsquo;s Gobuzo. It&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;re looking well but&hellip; What is that?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I asked subconsciously sensing an ominous aura emitting from the bag.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Are? Isn&rsquo;t this Gobuzo? What is this all about?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Gobuzo could answer, Gobuta and I both started to notice following my question&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobuzo&rsquo;s answer was the testimony to my prediction, a truly horrifying foreshadowing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, Rimuru-sama! And Gobuta-san? I was told to bring Shion-sama her cooking ingredients.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hold on a second.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just, hold on for a while.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Go-Gobuzo-kun? Whatever is inside that bloody bag, could&mdash;&mdash;it&mdash;&mdash;be the ingredients?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Y-yeah Gobuzo. This-this is way too early to deliver right? Show us what&rsquo;s inside the bag for a moment.&#12301; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru&rsquo;s face is also gradually turning blue again, and demanded Gobuzo to open the bag.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What rolled from it was&mdash;&mdash;a head of a Ushiroku[4].</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A mighty one at that, with a pair of strong horns.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But!! The problem here isn&rsquo;t whether it&rsquo;s a mighty beast or not.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Hold on a sec! A Ushiroku&rsquo;s head is completely inedible, right?!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I scream that out without knowing.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Mr Ushiroku&rsquo;s head, could you please stop looking at me with disappointment.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It must have been severed in an instant and transported here directly, so now its open eyes stare deep into mine.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s a bit horrifying when you think about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s a feeling I wouldn&rsquo;t imagine feeling on day of a feast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is probably what eating raw means, but even then, neh&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is it really like that? Before, Shuna-sama said the same thing to Shion-sama, but it only seemed to ignited (ignite) her more&hellip;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Gobuzo said. I also recall having been warned by Shuna about this being inedible.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But because of that, Shion has been pretty competitive about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;(An)Ingredient that even Shuna-sama can&rsquo;t handle&mdash;&mdash;I shall make it work then!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sudden invoked vain led her to order Gobuzo to bring the ingredient here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;This is bad&hellip;. Shion is probably going on a rampage right now.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No way... So it was me &nbsp;who was going to eat this&hellip;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru looks dead inside.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it would seem Gobuta has also sensed the danger of the situation seeing Benimaru like that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;We-well, we have our own mission, so&hellip;!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Gobuta fled as he said so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It happened in a matter of seconds so even Benimaru wasn&rsquo;t able to stop them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I see Gobuta&rsquo;s leadership skill has also improved.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I agree. That bastard really only has exceptional skill in detecting danger&hellip;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru agreed in pain.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But in turn, this means there&rsquo;s no chance of Gobuta getting involved in this whole mess.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So we have to deal with the Ushiroku ourselves.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru peeked at me and patted Gobuzo&rsquo;s shoulder with determination</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Rimuru-sama is also very much looking forward to Shion&rsquo;s cooking. But he is feeling like having some vegetable soup today. Tell Shion I said that.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What the..?? Bunch of nonsense&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi! Benimaru you bastard! This has nothing to do with me, right!?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Please don&rsquo;t say so without giving me a hand!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t get me involved! Weren&#39;t you the one who tried to trick me before!?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It&rsquo;s as you said, and I&rsquo;ve been reflecting on that. However, this may be too much, no!?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru of course is referring to the head of Ushiroku.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Mah&hellip; That is definitely not happening.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Right?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We look at each other and nod.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Gobuzo, allow me return that.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;AH!? If I did that, Shion-sama would be mad at me. I&rsquo;ve been selected as a member of Shion-sama&rsquo;s new platoon, so I don&rsquo;t want to disobey her order&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobuzo wouldn&rsquo;t accept it even if it&rsquo;s an order from Benimaru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s true that Gobuzo can refuse the order from Benimaru who he doesn&rsquo;t directly serve.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even so, he&rsquo;s got balls, disobeying an order from my direct subordinate. Gobuzo may not look the part, but he is surprisingly bold.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is normally a good thing, but not under this type of situation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It can&rsquo;t be helped: I guess I&rsquo;ll have to intervene.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, how do I put this? Gobuzo-kun, please return this. As Benimaru said, I&rsquo;m feeling vegetable soup now. So just deliver the message to Shion. On top of that, I&rsquo;ll gift you this as a token of my appreciation.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I began to negotiate with Gobuzo out of pity for Banimaru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so I place the kusarigama I took out of Kurobee&rsquo;s workshop out of interest in his hand for him to hold onto.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;This is a weapon named kusarigama, Gobuzo. It&rsquo;s a difficult weapon to wield, but it should come in handy for Gobuzo-kun who&rsquo;s gained Extra Skill &#12300;Total Memorization&#12301;and &#12300;Self-Regeneration&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hand it to him as I say so,</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobuzo is extremely moved.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Understood! Gobuzo will obey if it is a request from Rimuru-sama&#12301;!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Mmm-hmm. It&rsquo;s good that you understand. When you are skilled with it, I&rsquo;ll request a better kusarigama from Kurobee. Good luck with your practice!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Yes sir!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gubuzo seems delighted and proceeded to return the Ushiroku head.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Crisis resolved.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although now Benimaru owns me a favor, I wouldn&rsquo;t even want to think about the fact that I have to return and taste Shion&rsquo;s cooking.~</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;&quot;Sympathy won&rsquo;t be of aid&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">For real, it is truly unpredictable how fashion would become one day.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt55" id="ftnt_ref55">[55]</a></sup></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it is for that reason life is more interesting.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of which, Gobuzo was able to successfully convince Shion after we parted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Benimaru&rsquo;s line of &ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c8">Rimuru-sama feels like vegetable soup&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">was the most decisive point. I had to agree to that given it&rsquo;s the original ending.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s fine, and here&rsquo;s the story of Gobuzo.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">~&#12300;I&rsquo;m surprised you have helped me collecting information on Rimuru-sama, nicely done Gobuzo!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion said happily while proposing Gobuzo with a suggestion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is, acquiring &#12302;Pain Resistance&#12303;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a necessary skill if Gobuzo would like to learn to use kusarigama.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is probably unavoidable for Gobuzo to add a few scars on himself since he&rsquo;s not really an agile individual.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, what Shion taught him was &nbsp;impossible without Extra Skill &#12302;Total Memorization&#12303; and &#12302;Self-Regeneration&#12303;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To gain resistance to the feeling of pain by hurting oneself deliberately&mdash;&mdash;that&rsquo;s the best way I could put it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&hellip; getting hit by Shion&hellip; That would probably feel nice!&#12301; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;That&rsquo;s the spirit, Gobuzo! Do work hard to improve.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">While I&rsquo;m not sure whether such exchange actually took place, from that day onward, Gobuzo has been sticking a knife on his forehead.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What in the world is that idiot doing!? So I thought, and it really is pretty stupid-looking.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even though it looks stupid, Gobuzo did in fact gain &#12302;Pain Resistance&#12303;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it is also a fact that this led to many others to do the same thing</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s way too dangerous.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I decided to add this method to my list of things he&rsquo;s not allowed to say.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;As such, those who visited wanting to learn how Gobuzo gained pain nullification will never be able to find out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are things better left undiscovered in this world.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Gobuzo left, I was introduced to the three Beastketeers</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru summoned them here to greet me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I seem to have received more enthusiastic greets than before.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Well, if Rimuru-sama can gather powerful majin such as Benimaru-sama and Shion-san, there&rsquo;s no need to doubt the power of Rimuru-sama.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alvis said so while Benimaru shows signs of fear as he is still thinking about Shion&rsquo;s cooking.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Would her view change after seeing him in that state&hellip;?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although I&rsquo;m a bit intrigued but alas. Even I fear about Shion&rsquo;s cooking, so I can&rsquo;t mock Benimaru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went to check on the beastmen&rsquo;s temporary residence accompanied by Benimaru and the Beastketeers after that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those are the encouraged people setting up tents and distributing resources.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I also came to memorize the Beastmen&rsquo;s faces for a better relationship in the future, living under the same roof.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The beastmen are building their tents at the designated refuge area underground.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All labor forces are working together under Geld&rsquo;s command.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Due to the night feast, they&rsquo;ve decided to finish laying out the bedsheets by the end day.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, there seems to be a few people with new wounds all over&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;These guys won&rsquo;t listen to me, so I had to communicate with them with my fists.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, they got beat up due to disobeying order, according to Geld.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elephant Beastman and bear Beastman, such men who are bigger in size work as Geld&rsquo;s hands and feet. Thanks to that, the operation seems to be proceeding faster than expected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;It would definitely be faster if we &nbsp;did the job entirely on our own, but they (the beastmen) wouldn&rsquo;t remember how to do it without us instructing. So I had to teach them a lesson.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld said so as if it&rsquo;s natural.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Zoir and Talos, who are quite strong within the ranks of Beast king&rsquo;s army, can barely put up a match against Geld-san over there.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed. But this would make things simpler. Since we always follow the strong due to our instincts.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to Alvis as Suphia, the Beastman society is a total hierarchy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">For that reason, they would follow the instructions of the strong when in a situation such as this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The unease brought by the disappearance of Karion led most beastmen into a state of frenzic rage. However, they will regain their rationality upon being defeated by a more powerful existence.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, this hierarchy allowed things to be smoother once they decided to obey.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This, plus Gerudo&rsquo;s strong leadership.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was able to see through the beastmen&rsquo;s characters and turn them into his troops. In order to perform more efficiently , he turned his own subordinates into overseers of their own operations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As expected of Geld.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such techniques of troop maneuvering wouldn&rsquo;t be accessible &nbsp;were it not for Geld&rsquo;s everyday involvement in construction work.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Nicely done, Geld. By this rate, you should be able to finish by the evening.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Indeed! We would definitely catch up.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What a reliable man.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And speaking of being reliable, my attention turned to some else.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The one who&rsquo;s been distributing healing potions among the injured beastmen</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The one giving them potions is Gabiru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabiru has been surprisingly well-rounded in doing those types of things.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps it is also a talent to be able to befriend any race.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Gabiru, do you have any concern? Is there enough medicine?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I-Isn&rsquo;t this Rimuru-sama! No problem at all. Our production lately has also increased so there&rsquo;s still plenty in stock.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so? Good work then! I&rsquo;m relying on you in the future as well!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;YES SIR&mdash;&mdash;! I&rsquo;LL SERVE YOU WITH MY LIFE!!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabiru answered so, almost planning to kneel before me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem he&rsquo;s lost his smugness of late, perhaps it&rsquo;s about time to give him a raise...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Next time, I&rsquo;ll grant you a vacation. You should go visit your father and prepare a report on that. &#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;B-but&hellip;. I&rsquo;ve been severed tie and chased out of home&hellip;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No need to worry, just visit with Souka under my name as a messenger.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Oh, OH, </span><span class="c4 c8">OH</span><span class="c0">&hellip;!! I like this, thank you so much. Please do entrust this duty to me!!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabiru accepted happily and went back to work.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three Beastketeers &nbsp;stayed while having high hopes for the night feast. Our party then parted.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After the inspection, I returned to my room.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the way, I started chatting with Benimaru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I think it&rsquo;s about to raise Gabiru to a higher office.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, I think that&rsquo;s a good idea as well. He seems competent power-wise, and although that guy is still the same in terms of personality, there&rsquo;s still a lot of hope in his future.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So it&rsquo;s decided..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If necessary, I should also fix the severed tie between the Gabiru household.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#12300;Hmm, as our officer, it would be bad for our image having a severed tie with a </span><span class="c4">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;[5] clan chief. We better talk to Abiru and resolve the severed tie between the two.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;So it is for that reason. But it sure is concerning. If it is misunderstood that our country has bad blood with a internal officer, the Lizardman clan would probably be in an awkward spot.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru seemed to have caught up to me. It does help a lot that we are able to engage in the proper topic so fast.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabiru probably also wish to make peace with his father in his heart somehow. Besides, it really won&rsquo;t be productive to continue this severed relationship.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for the lizardman clan chief Abiru, if his kid was able to become an officer under a demon lord, it should be sufficient reason to reconnect with Gabiru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problem here is that both Gabiru and Abiru are being stubborn.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we don&rsquo;t arrange Souka to mitigate prior to the event, they may end up in a fight.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s better to arrange things first and execute with sufficient preparations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I should ask Souei to help.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since he has already met Abiru, it would be alright to let him negotiate.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I left as I thought so with Benimaru.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Hehehehe, WHAHAHA! Only one more passage left)</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll attempt to select one of the entries,</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although the narrative would continue, but we have limited time so far.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Regrettably, the introduction shall end here.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">For those interested in what I have introduced, please consider purchasing a copy of &#12300;Rimuru&rsquo;s Notebook&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you&rsquo;ve read it, you should have sufficient reasons to understand how much the Great Demon Lord Rimuru cherishes his subordinates.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To the Demon Lord&rsquo;s subordinates, to his people, Demon Lord Rimuru is not a symbol of horror, but an existence that parallel parenthood.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That has not changed from then to now. &nbsp; &nbsp;&middot;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">(D: Following are &ldquo;alternative narratives&rdquo; in Rimuru&rsquo;s head)</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Knowing that the underling Shion was not good at cooking, both still decided to eat with his subordinate Benimaru in his aid.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Supplied Kurobee with ideas for new weapons when he&rsquo;s troubled with innovating.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Enjoyed fishing alongside Gobuta and his subordinates</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Discovered and inspired the future martial artist&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;Kusarigama Gobuzo&rdquo;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Helping the Beastmen in need without asking anything in return, as well as &nbsp;being able to sign a permanent non-aggression pact with their nation.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Listening to the subordinates&rsquo; complaints while helping to solve their issues.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it wasn&rsquo;t easy at all to help them all resolve their issues.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That demon lord, the more you try to learn about its personality, the more understanding you feel towards those close to it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Especially the part about tasting Shion&rsquo;s cooking, that&rsquo;s not a task for everyone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aya, my apologies, I may have gotten a little bit too emotional.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I was saying&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though this feeling of friendliness can be a strategic propaganda by Demon Lord Rimuru&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&rsquo;ll be the judge of that.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hopefully you will be able to make the proper judgement after reading this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Could it be trying deceive humanity, or perhaps, trying to fit in human society from the bottom of its heart?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will more or less get a peek into the Demon Lord&rsquo;s mind after reading this book.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, I hope everyone would be able to see what Demon Lord Rimuru is truly contemplating</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And wish that one day, the discussion of such a topic will end with the book.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the hopes of freeing people from suspicion, I hereby promote this book.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Written by one who wants to know more about the Great Demon Lord Rimuru&mdash;&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Done and done.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Given I have promoted in a huge scale for the product in this way, a ceiling-breaking sale is definitely expected.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Becoming a best-selling work, I&rsquo;m counting down days before I&rsquo;m called a writer-sensei. I believe the journalists gathered here would also be able to understand my feeling. Or so I thought&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I finished introducing the content of the book, the journalists at the conference all started expressing unbelieving doubt.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ayyy, we are truly sorry. But your words are a bit different from the content in the book&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What? Different&hellip; from the content&hellip;?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I laid my eyes on my notes as I heard the reporters&rsquo; doubts, and there it does record my real actions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, my actual actions.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oi, why is it real!?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I remember I changed the narrative for the better, but how come my actual records of actions are documented?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s something I can&rsquo;t solve even with shouting out loud</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12298;Due to the inaccuracies in the narratives, I&rsquo;ve conducted revisions to the content.&#12299;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">WOW, so you are the criminal!!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What-What in the world have you done!?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ano, real? So, the ones being written here is supposed to be the correct records?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, no, about that&hellip;.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is bad.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">VERY BAD.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had the illusion of having cold sweat even with a non-sweat secreting body.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;And, we had no idea this book even existed, so where do we get to read it?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, did they just ask that?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is true though, since the existence of my study is not known to any.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because, I was only going to promote it from now on.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the moment my original draft has been stored in my &#12302;Stomach&#12303; and there&rsquo;s few who can actually access it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, only I have access to it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I was thinking about excuses, the other reporters also start to join the commotion.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would seem trying to play dumb would backfire with this one.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was going to earn some quick cash while enhancing my personal image, so it would seem I have to give up for the time being.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It can&rsquo;t be helped, it&rsquo;s time for my strategic exit.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Can&rsquo;t believe that my precious plan to improve my public image just got hindered in such unexpected place.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reporting, communicating and conferencing and such are all my miscalculations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Fu, FUHAHAHA! It would seem I have been exposed. See you all another time then my fellow friends!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said so while trying to retrieve all the reading demo handed out just now.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And after which used &#12302;Teleportation&#12303; to escape in an instance.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so the &ldquo;Plan to sell Rimuru&rsquo;s notebooks&rdquo; was a failure in the end.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;...</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that, I forgot to retrieve one of test notebooks.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That notebook was the copy that became famous for the times to come&mdash;&mdash;The existence known as &ldquo;Rimuru&rsquo;s notebook&rdquo;, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have any reason to know about it at the time.</span></p>

		<p class="c11 c10 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c10 c3 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Long time no see!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s been five months since the last volume, and here I bring you the sixth volume of &#12298;That time I got reincarnated as a slime&#12299;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now it&rsquo;s afterword time as usual.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time I again confront Editor I-san and had an intense war regarding whether I should write this or not.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I was writing the first volume, I-san was very gentle.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;If you really dislike writing afterword, it&rsquo;s okay to skip it~!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Is that so? Thanks a lot then! I really don&rsquo;t know and am not good at writing this, your words just save me!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I recall such conversation back then.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">HOW-EVER!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ve tried using page number, the afterword is around eight-page long!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Eh? Eight pages, isn&rsquo;t that too many?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, afterword has reached eight pages, isn&rsquo;t that a bit much.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">So of course I would have concerns about it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Oh well it can&rsquo;t be helped. Due to binding issue with the book, if we are to cut down blank pages, the entire afterword would be lost.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Ah, then I should just skip it&mdash;&mdash;&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No way, what do you mean by that? You have to write the afterword.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we agreed during volume 1 that it&rsquo;s not necessary, that kind and gentle Editor I-san is gone&hellip;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I am quite fond of reading afterword of my novel I like, but whenever it is my turn to write, I am in the &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay to skip it&rdquo; faction.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ability to think flexibly with accordance to different points of view is one of my special talent&mdash;&mdash;but it can&rsquo;t work now&mdash;&mdash;I tried to use this talent to convince I-san, but&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;I&rsquo;ll make you write it even if we need to increase pages! What &ldquo;not writing afterword&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s not an option for you!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After getting a scolding from the editor, my road to not writing afterword is blocked.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I understand it won&rsquo;t matter even if I struggle more, so after countless negotiations I get to cut down some of the pages.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh well, however.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s time for the cliche every time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;This time there may be a little more pages&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Don&rsquo;t worry, just don&rsquo;t mind it and keep writing!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even with that little interjection, they still wanted me to write the afterword.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve always concerned about the increase of pages, and as it turns out the worries were unnecessary.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The pages of the actual story has increased a lot and now the pages for afterword needs to increase as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Editor I-san is truly crazy.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, when I hand in my first draft, here are I-san&rsquo;s thoughts:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;XX scene seems to have been cut, what happened there?&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, it&rsquo;s just that the pages involved are too many so I had to cut it out!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No way you are serious about that?! We have to leave that scene in!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;No, but, the rest of the content is not easily cut to fit it in&hellip;...&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Seriously, don&rsquo;t worry over the cuts! Just write it. You can write as much as&#12298;Slime&#12299; if you want.&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a conversation we had.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the end when I finished the first draft, the content has increased the most since I started with an addition of around ten thousand words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Due to the double line typesetting, it&rsquo;s rumored to be the light novel with the most words from GC series. And even the page number has jumped to number one.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#12300;Now we&rsquo;ve made a new record!&#12301;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Editor I-san says so.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">How ambitious is his?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all these trouble, volume six is finally out.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The volume has packed with most content in Tensura series, I hope everyone would have a fun time reading it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now as followed I would like to do some discussion regarding the content of the volume.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I&rsquo;ve mentioned in volume 2, I always read afterword when I read book.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why there will be obvious spoiler, so you should prepare yourself before reading.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8415;&#8415; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I&rsquo;ve mentioned in the afterword of volume 5, I&rsquo;ve added a lot of content this time as well.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can tell from the catalogue, Rimuru gets recognize in the volume and becomes a real Demon Lord. It&rsquo;s written up to the birth of &#12300;Eight Star Demon Lords&#12301;.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Based on the fourth arc&#12300;Birth of Demon Lord&#12301;from the Web version, I present the full story in volume 5 and volume 6.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the content from the web version of &#12300;Birth of Demon Lord&#12301;is not enough for fill the whole of volume 5, you can imagine that most of the content was added afterward.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve also interacted with Editor I-san and so the content is just like what I&rsquo;ve mentioned in the afterword of volume 5.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c4">I&rsquo;ve worked hard on this in order to avoid being called that the effort in my work is all filler like Calpis</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt56" id="ftnt_ref56">[56]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;diluted in water. </span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s about it regarding this volume&hellip;..</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As usual, there are many characters present this time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would probably be easier for web version reader to remember them, but the light novel reader may have a hard time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that I think about it more carefully, this light novel has twice as many words as most standard light novel, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be that many characters being presented.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone must want to see the illustrations, right&mdash;&mdash;About that, I&rsquo;ll rely on Mitz Vah sensei&rsquo;s work!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ten Great Demon Lords&mdash;&mdash;Eh? Why are there eleven people? How strange&mdash;&mdash;but the product is quite cool with everyone in the same room.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of which, Mitz Vah sensei apparently had got into a heated debate with Editor I-san regarding the breast size of female characters, I&rsquo;ve not taken part into that part. As for whether the outcome of the debate is reflected, I&rsquo;ll have everyone who read the end result of the illustration be the judge.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh oh, I&rsquo;m getting off topic.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s how it is, now with beautiful illustrations the imagination with the characters become much easier.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now to examine the difference from the web version, I can say perhaps only the outline is similar.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, it is possible that certain character&rsquo;s motive has completely changed with such tweaks in setting, and there are actually many changes if we are looking at details alone.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s quite hard to find original scene from the web version.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">There will be more and more such small changes in the future that would amount to a completely different story.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">But with that being said, I still intend to retain the outline of the web story. But I&rsquo;ll only know the result after I write.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hope everyone would continue to support me with the final product of&#12298;That time I got reincarnated by a slime&#12299; by that time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>

		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now it&rsquo;s time for the summary of the afterword, I want to write some words of gratitude.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thanks to Mitz Vah sensei who has been helping with the beautiful illustrations.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">After reading the design draft of the characters, some of the character design even took the place of their original images in my heart.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What a great thing to embrace such thrill!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I would add more new characters in the future, I look forward to the feedback.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And also many thanks to Taiki Kawakami sensei who&rsquo;s been in charge of the manga art as well as mange Editor U-san.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You guys&mdash;&mdash;responded to my stubborn demands, I truly appreciate it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this time I also asked for your guys&rsquo; assistance and was responded with very straight-forward agreement.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eh, do you want me to reduce the number of pages of afterword?</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">What does that mean, I don&rsquo;t understand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My thanks also go out to Editor I-san who discusses with me all the time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your opinion is truly valuable to me.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any work that not even the editor would approve is likely not possible to resonate with the readers either.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hope you will also be as honest as you are now with your opinion!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">My thanks go out to all the members who worked on proofreading, design as well as the production of the book.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Especially the fellow coworkers working on proofreading, it must be very hard proofreading so many words.</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thanks to everyone&rsquo;s effort!</span></p>
		<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">And lastly my thanks go out to all the readers who bought the book, I&rsquo;ll continue to work hard to allow everyone be able to enjoy &#12298;That time I got reincarnated as a slime&#12299; in the future.</span></p>

The power of the spells ranges from Fireball to Giant Magic Fireball, with some variations like Giant Magic Flame Barrier or Giant Magic Flame Storm. For the casting bit, think of it this way: Imagine the spells as a book or essay. The book or essay gets longer the more advanced and powerful the spell gets. Fireball would be a short, 2 sentence essay, while Giant Magic Fireball is a novel. Now scale, or size.When people remember something, what you are trying to remember often appears as a picture in your mind. Now, imagine trying to read a 300 page novel from memory, but the image you get in your head in only a fraction of the actual size.</span></p>
