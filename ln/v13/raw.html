The first one, needless to say, was about the person who tried to assassinate him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Someone who even </span><span class="c7">I</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;couldn&rsquo;t sense&hellip;There are only a few people capable of doing that. Although, I do have an idea of who it could be&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was afraid to acknowledge it. This was because if his prediction were correct, then that meant the emperor was aware of all the schemes that had been perpetrated by himself, Yuuki, and his subordinates. And, perhaps worst of all, that they had been dancing in the palm of his hand the whole time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, it&rsquo;s possible. His Imperial Majesty Rudra has lived far longer than I have. His wisdom and power are beyond the imagination of ordinary men. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he anticipated something like this happening and made preparations decades in advance. But if that&rsquo;s true, then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was fine now since he left the Empire, but Yuuki would be in immediate danger, and this was what concerned him. Thus, the question arose: Should he warn Yuuki or ignore the problem? It wasn&rsquo;t that they were strangers; in fact, Gadra had somewhat taken a liking to Yuuki. Gadra wanted to help, but now that he was working for Rimuru, it would&rsquo;ve been unacceptable for him to take independent action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rather than stressing over it alone, he also had the option to simply consult with Rimuru. On the other hand, if he shared uncertain information that turned out to be false, Rimuru&rsquo;s trust in Gadra would plummet. To make matters worse, Gadra had already betrayed the Empire. Any further loss of credibility would greatly affect his position in the future. Stuck weighing the pros and cons of his dilemma, Gadra was unable to come to a decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover&hellip;he couldn&rsquo;t gather his thoughts because of his second suspicion, which weighed heavily on his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That face, that aura&mdash;it was undoubtedly the same as His Majesty Rudra. However, he didn&rsquo;t react when he saw me, and it seemed like he didn&rsquo;t even know who I was. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s an impostor, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emperor Rudra couldn&rsquo;t possibly have been in that location.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s no other answer, regardless of how you look at it</span><span class="c1">&mdash;that was the conclusion Gadra came to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">In that case, he must&rsquo;ve been a different person who only </span><span class="c2">appeared</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;like Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If that person really is His Majesty Rudra&mdash;no, that&rsquo;s ridiculous. What&rsquo;s more important is the person who stabbed me. That person is definitely </span><span class="c7">him</span><span class="c2">, and that means Yuuki&rsquo;s in danger. My conscience will never forgive me if I don&rsquo;t at least give him a warning. Furthermore, I shall also report this to Rimuru-sama.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, Gadra chose to put his friendship first. His reputation might drop as a result, but that was worth the risk. After all, strength was what ultimately mattered most in this country. And to Gadra, this meritocracy was a dream come true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having finally made a decision, he sprang into action.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;It&rsquo;s me. Yuuki, I have to warn you about something. You see&mdash;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without regard for the other person&rsquo;s convenience, Gadra went on to convey his message.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Oi oi, this is so out of the blue.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I didn&rsquo;t have a choice. Think about my position. Rimuru-sama might start questioning my loyalty for reaching out to you, so I don&rsquo;t have time to argue. I&rsquo;ll do my best, and you should keep an eye out so that no one kills you in your sleep.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, Gadra ended his &lsquo;Magic Communication&rsquo; with Yuuki and headed straight to Rimuru in order to report the situation&mdash;carrying out ReCoCo (report, communicate, and consult) without missing a beat. He was an expert in training subordinates, so he did not fall short in that aspect.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just as I thought; that old man is safe. Moreover, it seems that he has shrewdly joined Rimuru-san&rsquo;s ranks,&rdquo; Yuuki murmured to himself, smiling wryly as he gazed out the window.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been raining for a while in the Imperial capital, and the view from his window was quite poor. Despite that, Yuuki&rsquo;s eyes still managed to pick out a suspicious silhouette lurking about in the downpour. Judging from his experienced movements, there was little doubt that he had been monitoring Yuuki&rsquo;s whereabouts. Although he was aware of this, he had nothing but a pleasant smile on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another person in the room&mdash;Kagali&mdash;responded to Yuuki&rsquo;s monologue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you talking about Gadra? If you are, then it&rsquo;s not surprising at all. Even I, an ex-demon lord, find that old man cunning and tricky. That&rsquo;s why cooperating with him was beneficial.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki agreed with Kagali, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Thanks to him, we managed to secure this position. And now, he gave us some crucial information.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Yuuki had fully expected Gadra to bring useful intelligence from Tempest. For instance, information about the so-called Hero named Chronoa. It remained unclear whether she was alive or not. Since Rimuru was unharmed, that meant she had to have been defeated, but still&hellip;if Rimuru had somehow managed to pacify that violent thing, then there should&rsquo;ve been at least </span><span class="c2">some</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;sort of rumor floating around. However, he had yet to hear anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra hadn&rsquo;t mentioned her, so he couldn&rsquo;t rule out the possibility that she was confirmed dead. With the realization that he might be worrying too much, Yuuki dropped the thought. What he should be focusing on right now was Gadra&rsquo;s urgent report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, is that so? Then&hellip;what did Gadra say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He said Masayuki looks exactly like Emperor Rudra&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki couldn&rsquo;t help but smirk at Kagali&rsquo;s uncouth shout, which was more akin to her old self. After all, he felt that he probably would&rsquo;ve behaved the same way if only Gadra had given him more time to react to the sudden news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It makes no sense, right? I seriously wondered if the old man had gone senile or something, but apparently, he isn&rsquo;t joking. Also, can we really rule out the emperor disguising himself as Masayuki&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Yuuki&rsquo;s smile faded away as he recalled his encounter with Masayuki. As he sifted through his memories, he realized that Masayuki hadn&rsquo;t come to this world via summoning. He had told him, </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;I just found myself here before I knew it.&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Yuuki originally thought that he was simply a &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; who showed up to this world entirely by accident, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s no concrete proof that Masayuki is an otherworlder. He could&rsquo;ve been using magic or a Skill to&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki tried to think through the different possibilities but gave up. He switched gears and began to speak again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Never mind, let&rsquo;s ignore Masayuki for now. More importantly, let&rsquo;s talk about the people that are monitoring us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara, that was an interesting topic though&hellip;but you&rsquo;re right. Being under surveillance all the time is going to feel suffocating.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know, right? It&rsquo;s going to interfere with our goals, so we might have to abandon all of our plans before that happens.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You heard me. If what gramps told us is accurate, then we are in a precarious situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be a mistake to move the Mixed Corps, which was deployed towards the Dwarven Kingdom, if Gadra&rsquo;s words were to be taken at face value. He needed to reconsider what would happen next&mdash;no, even before that, he had to start all over again, determining who his allies and enemies really were. That was the ledge Yuuki&rsquo;s group found themselves pushed up against.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;I see. Then, this certainly isn&rsquo;t the time to be chatting about the boy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali didn&rsquo;t doubt Yuuki&rsquo;s words. If he thought that it was dangerous, then it was, indisputably so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gramps said he requested an audience with the emperor, when he was stabbed in the back by someone once he arrived.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be Kondou?&rdquo; asked Kagali, but then quickly refuted herself. &ldquo;Maybe not. I thought Kondou was the only person who could kill Gadra, but if the shadowy Single Digits were involved, one of them might well have had the talent to pull it off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised if Tatsuya Kondou turned out to be the perpetrator in the first place&mdash;it was too obvious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree with that. But there&rsquo;s another reason why I&rsquo;m shocked. Gadra said he had an idea of who the culprit was.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room went silent. Kagali exhaled and, while looking into Yuuki&rsquo;s eyes, asked, &ldquo;&hellip;Are you saying that perhaps this person is someone we both know well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali&rsquo;s eyes told him that there was no escaping the question. A bitter smile appeared on Yuuki as he nodded lightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to believe, but that&rsquo;s exactly right. Of course, there&rsquo;s always a chance that the old man was mistaken. However, this is not something that can be settled with a simple apology.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali&rsquo;s eyes suddenly widened, and any hint of a smile disappeared from her expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does that mean this person is someone important among our companions?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Yuuki nodded, and in contrast to Kagali, his smile deepened as he spoke. &ldquo;The name of the traitor is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c5 c22">Chapter 1</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c25">Unrest and Resolve</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">A month had passed since the meeting with the executives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had been meticulously observing the Empire&rsquo;s movements in the Control Room, day after day. This was where every bit of scoured intel came together, and as a result, Benimaru and I basically lived here. Although, we made sure to go back home at night. If I left my house vacant too long, Veldora and Ramiris would almost certainly turn it into their own personal hideout. Since a lot of effort was put into constructing my hermitage, it was only right that I should make the most of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru always looked well dressed, so I believe he regularly went back to his room. Even though I didn&rsquo;t necessarily have to worry about such things, there would be a serious problem if our supreme commander collapsed from exhaustion before our decisive battle with the Empire could begin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Control Room was constantly staffed. With the threat of war looming, people were present 24 hours a day, and they rotated in shifts of three to make sure nobody was overworked. I made sure that everyone took care of their own health, which was the most important thing. Thankfully, I really didn&rsquo;t have to fret over my sworn friends, Veldora-san and Ramiris, about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You never had to instruct those two to take it easy. Rather, they just played around as they liked. They were excited at first about the war, but following a month of inactivity, they became utterly bored. Now, they were back in their research lab and told me, quite selfishly might I add, to inform them if there was any movement. Well, they&rsquo;d be a nuisance if they were here anyway, so I let them do whatever they pleased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why the executives currently present in this room were me, Benimaru, and Souei, as well as my secretaries, Shion and Diablo. And I couldn&rsquo;t forget Geld either, though I felt sorry whenever I interrupted his construction work for too long. Ideally, I&rsquo;d like to end the war as soon as possible, before Frey-san flew into a rage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That being said, it ultimately depended on our enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In war, the aggressors held the initiative. If the enemy didn&rsquo;t come at you, then your side wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fight even if you wanted to. We had predicted that the Imperial tank units would arrive in approximately 20 days, yet their movement was slower than expected. To be more precise, they were purposely delaying their advance so they could flaunt their military might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While we had already grown accustomed to their appearance thanks to our continued surveillance with my &lsquo;Argus&rsquo;, those that saw a tank for the first time would definitely associate them with the imposing presence of a vicious monster. Even monsters were afraid of huge and brutish opponents. The magic beasts living in the forest, which were A-ranked or below, were no exceptions; they fled from the advancing path of the Imperial Army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of which, the Imperial Army had already crossed our national border. Although unauthorized entry into our country was completely unacceptable under international law ratified by the Western States Council, the enemy was the Empire, which didn&rsquo;t play by the rules. Since things had reached this point, how we strategically exploited this loophole was especially important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could actually use their incursion as a reason to launch a surprise attack&hellip;but I still felt that we should at least have a talk with them. The Empire had a history of recommending surrender, so I decided to refrain from attacking until that opportunity presented itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re being way too optimistic when preparations aren&rsquo;t even close to being done. No matter what, we will settle it in battle anyway, so we don&rsquo;t have to be underhanded,&rdquo; Benimaru reassured with a rather complacent attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I found his confidence comforting, and so we steadily prepared for our war against the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, the days of waiting finally came to an end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Empire had stopped moving and started to get in formation. The Imperial Army wasn&rsquo;t stupid. They never had any intention of fighting fair and square and instead sent infantry units&mdash;different from the tank units&mdash;one after another into the woods. They numbered 700,000 soldiers in total, or 70 percent of the Empire&rsquo;s total forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This wasn&rsquo;t anything new, but I would review it anyway once more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is undoubtedly their main force,&rdquo; I pointed out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree. The purpose of the tank unit is to serve as a decoy and, at the same time, contain the Dwarven Army.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. They&rsquo;re ensuring their rear will be protected while attacking our country. They&rsquo;re being extremely cautious, even with a large army.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The slow pace of the tank group wasn&rsquo;t just for demonstration. Another, more important purpose, was to distract us from the main infantry unit until they finished assembling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, at least we clearly see their intentions. It&rsquo;s astonishing how much of an advantage we hold over them simply by controlling information,&rdquo; Benimaru commented with a chuckle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, as expected of Rimuru-sama. What you must mean is that everything is in the palm of your hand!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Diablo didn&rsquo;t waste a second butting in with his usual &ldquo;sasurimu</span><sup class="c5 c18"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo; praise. This was a daily routine by now, and with a quick &ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; we moved on. Once you got the hang of it, Diablo was very easy to handle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Regarding the Empire&rsquo;s infantrymen, it seems we may have taken their threat level a bit too lightly. Each and every single one of them is talented&mdash;there are no deserters, either&mdash;and have gathered 30 kilometers away from Rimuru, our capital. They&rsquo;ve even encamped and set up a command post there,&rdquo; Souei explained, bringing us all up to speed on the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And thanks to the information that we also got from Moss, the accuracy of our intel was unquestionably high. Supplemented by my &lsquo;Argus&rsquo;, we had the full picture of the enemy deployment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be suspicious if we didn&rsquo;t react to the fact that they&rsquo;re practically at our doorstep?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case here,&rdquo; Benimaru rebutted. &ldquo;They genuinely believe in their own superiority and that their covert operation is running smoothly. They&rsquo;re underestimating us and have begun preparations to move in immediately after their offer of surrender.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu, I agree with what Benimaru-dono said. Furthermore, these 30 kilometers is the perfect distance&mdash;not too far and not too close. After all, surveillance through magic loses its precision as distance increases. With magic interference caused by legion magic on top of that, they wholeheartedly trust the area to be completely undetectable, and that they are pulling everything off perfectly. It is laughable, but I think that is the limit of their capabilities.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apparently, my worries were unfounded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I figured they would&rsquo;ve found our apparent inaction fishy and reasoned that it was all due to some kind of a trap we laid for them. But, as I was just told, the enemy was under the impression that we weren&rsquo;t aware of their movements. On that account, the only cause for concern was how strong their infantry was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Souei, how strong are the enemy soldiers?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei had pointed out that the threat they posed was high, so they must&rsquo;ve been quite strong. Depending on his answer, I thought it might be necessary to rethink our entire strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They have an average rank of B in terms of the classification that humans refer to. The higher-ranking ones are above rank A, and the lower-ranking ones are at least C-plus-ranked. Compared to the knights of the Western Nations, they are much better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, that was a stronger force than I had anticipated. However, combat in this world was all about quality over quantity. While B-ranked individuals were tough, there were times where a single A rank was way more dangerous. With that said, the power of teamwork couldn&rsquo;t be understated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you telling me none of them are temporary conscripts, but instead career soldiers?&rdquo; Benimaru exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. The level of training, first-rate weapons and armor, tactics&mdash;by all accounts, they outperform the knights of the Western Nations in every single category. You may even find your &lsquo;Hell Flare&rsquo; struggling to penetrate their magical defenses.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">According to Souei, the enemy&rsquo;s force had legion magic active around the clock. Their proficiency was simply superb, and their overall strength as a platoon-sized</span><sup class="c5 c18"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;unit would be A-ranked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like Gobta and his subordinates, well-coordinated units were vexatious opponents. Their total strength was often many times more than the sum of its parts. If a group of 20 people were equivalent to an A rank, then simple calculation told us that we would somehow be dealing with 35,000 A rankers. In other words, we couldn&rsquo;t let our guard down. They were pretty dangerous opponents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyway, it won&rsquo;t be a problem. That&rsquo;s why we have the labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu. If the enemies are scattered within the labyrinth, then destroying them before they can even use their full strength would be a cinch. This merely means that everything is just as Rimuru-sama predicted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not really though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">In the end, the plan to intercept them in the labyrinth was the correct course of action, but it also depended on the enemy&rsquo;s strength&mdash;</span><span class="c2">wait a second&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that I thought about it, I realized something. No matter how large of a force they came with, this interception strategy would be effective. In the labyrinth, it was possible to disperse the opponent&rsquo;s strength while concentrating our own. Hence, the reality was that they could only send an elite few if they seriously wanted to conquer the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s Raphael-sensei for you</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great that Ramiris is here, all things considered,&rdquo; I unintentionally mumbled out loud, and Benimaru voiced his agreement with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll prevent damage to the town and also make it easier to turn the war around in our favor. From the perspective of a commander, she is the worst person to make an enemy of.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could sincerely praise Ramiris because she was currently absent. If we praised her while she was in the same room, she would undoubtedly become smug and be annoyingly boastful afterwards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s leave it at that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t seem to have any issues on our side, but what about Gobta&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the massive screens in the Control Room, images of various locations were projected using my magic and on display. Naturally, there was footage of our neighbor, the Dwarven Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were 2,000 tanks neatly lined up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The assembly area was also 30 kilometers away from Dwargon&rsquo;s central city, also known as Central. Impressively enough, we had already expected this to be a location where they&rsquo;d gather. What I was concerned about was the performance of their tanks. Their muzzles were pointed at the imposing front gate, which I had visited many times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">It appeared that the magic tanks developed by the Empire had better performance than the tanks I was familiar with. There was even the possibility that the range of their guns was better than the ones of my old world&rsquo;s. </span><span class="c2">Although, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible for the shells to reach the gate from that distance&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta and Gabil were on standby in the inner square of the gate. The two of them had led their corps and undertaken their respective duties. They were able to evacuate the remaining residents of the inn town without experiencing any unexpected encounters. And, as we&rsquo;d originally planned, they joined up with the Dwarven Kingdom&rsquo;s forces as additional reinforcements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Dwarven Kingdom received both the corps commanders, Gobta and Gabil,&rdquo; reported Benimaru. &ldquo;Due to the defensive pact with Dwarven, they haven&rsquo;t lost their right to command.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We didn&rsquo;t have to worry about that since Gazel himself acknowledged it, and even the Dwarven Kingdom&rsquo;s army themselves seemed to be upholding the arrangement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, we are in the clear with that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;m worried about their coordination with the Dwarven Army&hellip; But I think it&rsquo;ll be fine if Tempest&rsquo;s Army focuses on attacking whereas the Dwarven Army focuses on defending.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The crux of military operation issues was confusion in the chain of command. In a joint battle consisting of armies from different countries like this one, it was necessary to decide which orders should be prioritized. Although with Benimaru, he could forcefully intervene using his Unique Skill &lsquo;Generalissimo&rsquo;. Thanks to that, even if enemies and allies were mixed up on the battlefield, friendly fire wasn&rsquo;t a concern. The inclusion of Dwarven troops was a potential source of confusion; thus, we came to the conclusion that it&rsquo;d be far more efficient to divide the roles between offense and defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just to be safe, I think talking to Gazel again would be a good idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I concur. Now that the Empire has already set up camps, there isn&rsquo;t much time before the war begins. It&rsquo;d be an appropriate time for us to take to the field as well, so should we contact King Gazel for a final confirmation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru and I were on the same wavelength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Therefore, I immediately reached for our newly installed &ldquo;Communicator&rdquo;. The Communicator was a magical telepathic communication machine that Vesta successfully developed. The crazy part about this device was its ability to send both audio </span><span class="c2">and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;visual information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Communicator looked exactly like a computer. It had a monitor, a mouse, and a keyboard&mdash;the mouse was more of a palm-sized crystal ball&mdash;and could be activated by simply touching it. After that, if you pressed the other party engraved on the keyboard, you could connect with them. It had a simple design that focused on being user-friendly. That said, there was a drawback.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The visual information were actually &ldquo;thoughts&rdquo; being regenerated in the brain. Consequently, whatever you were thinking&mdash;as long as you held and activated the Communicator&mdash;would be leaked directly to the other party. It worked on the same principle as &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo;. Since I was accustomed to this form of communication, I could just shut down any idle thoughts I had, but if someone unfamiliar tried to use it, they might give out unnecessary information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was also the potential danger of leaking any malicious thoughts you had to the other party. You shouldn&rsquo;t think of any ulterior motives. In my opinion, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend using this device to make advances on women. It would be safer for normal people who hadn&rsquo;t undergone mental training to only use the call function. Anyway, let&rsquo;s just eagerly wait for this machine&rsquo;s improvement in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Hello, this is Rimuru speaking. Is His Majesty Gazel there?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I casually greeted with a &ldquo;hello&rdquo; as if it was the norm even in this world. It was a habit so deeply ingrained in my body that I had said it without hesitation. And so, that became a rule of using the Communicator, which was quite charming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Hello, we are now calling for His Majesty Gazel. Could you please wait for a moment?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Understood.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could sense anxiety coming across the Communicator. He had the demeanor of a trained individual, but hearing my name apparently sent him into a panic. I mean, I would&rsquo;ve been nervous too if a business client&rsquo;s chairman suddenly called me. I should&rsquo;ve been more considerate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is extremely rude to keep Rimuru-sama waiting!&rdquo; Shion shouted, enraged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you really feel that way, then you should&rsquo;ve made the call yourself, right?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I was pretty sure answering calls was part of the job description as a real secretary. Despite that, Shion refused to touch the Communicator.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason was plain and simple&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t know how to use it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps saying she didn&rsquo;t know wasn&rsquo;t exactly accurate. I tried to teach her on numerous occasions, but her &ldquo;thoughts&rdquo; were so strong that breaking the apparatus was a real possibility. As a result, Shion developed a distaste for the Communicator. She had no right to complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As for me, I think meeting the other party face to face by invoking &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo; instead of using this thing is better. If you&rsquo;d like, I could bring King Gazel directly here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo, being Diablo, remarked that rather proudly. He wasn&rsquo;t any better. It was only polite to arrange an appointment first because the other party still had their own obligations to attend to. This time, however, we were the ones being impolite for calling Gazel without prior notice. Having to wait for a while was normal and getting angry here was plainly absurd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I heard Geld comment, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult for the other party to remain calm if Rimuru-sama suddenly reached out. I sympathize with their staff.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wish Shion and Diablo would follow his example.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel responded in less than three minutes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Sorry for the wait. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to contact you.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel&rsquo;s voice came from a speaker attached to the monitor. No images were shown. Since Raphael-san was the one controlling everything for me, I could choose what footage I wanted to share. Nevertheless, Gazel was still new to this, so he was only utilizing the call feature. It was a wise decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s good. I&rsquo;m hoping to get final confirmation of the division of roles in the joint battle.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&lsaquo;Hmm. While that </span><span class="c2">is</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;important, I have to inform you about something beforehand. The gate that links to Dwargon&rsquo;s east city&mdash;Eastern&mdash;has been blocked by the Imperial Army.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra&rsquo;s information was correct. Maybe they were the troops being led by Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I found the feed. I&rsquo;ll pass it on to you.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I pointed &lsquo;Argus&rsquo; towards the direction of the Empire. The feed wasn&rsquo;t very clear due to the lengthy distance and magic interference by a &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo;. Still, you could see a mass of people blocking the road that extended from Eastern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&lsaquo;It&rsquo;s exactly as you said. Initially, I suspected it was a trap when you said that the </span><span class="c2">enemy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was betraying the Empire, but now I can see some truth in it.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&lsaquo;No, I&rsquo;m not too sure about that. There&rsquo;s no doubt that Gadra has given up on the Empire, but I wonder if we should trust </span><span class="c2">him</span><span class="c1">. He has the tendency to take advantage of people without them realizing it, so we should remain cautious.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Hah, you could say that again! If you already know this much, well done!&rsaquo; Gazel praised with a hearty laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like he was testing me to see if I had let my guard down, but I was pretty sure he just wanted to act like my senior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel reined in his laughter and continued awkwardly, &lsaquo;So, Rimuru. It appears that the Empire was being evasive and have been purposely deceiving the envoy that we sent. For us here in Dwargon, a preemptive strike is a last resort by law. Despite the fact that it puts us at a disadvantage, the pride of the dwarves is on the line, so we will wait for the Empire to make the first move. You don&rsquo;t have to follow suit, but what are you planning to do?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having deduced his intention, it made me wonder what my next course of action was. I glanced over at Benimaru. He grinned and then shot me a signal with his eyes. We understood each other perfectly without needing to have a conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Got it.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;After taking a deep breath, I straightened myself and turned to the monitor. As I stared at the blank screen, I told him stiffly, &lsaquo;The Imperial Army entered our territory without our consent. This transgression cannot be overlooked, and our country is considering a hardline approach, with even military options being examined. Therefore, I would like to confirm the willingness of your country, our ally, to follow us.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Or something like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru seemed satisfied and Shion nodded eagerly. Geld was trembling with excitement, and Diablo, for some reason, was happily jotting down notes. I had no idea what those notes were or what he planned on doing with them, but certainly nothing good would come from it. I decided to dispose of them later and waited for Gazel&rsquo;s reply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Mhmm, now you&rsquo;re acting like a true king. That&rsquo;s fine by me. Wasn&rsquo;t it your intention from the beginning to intercept them here, after having lured them deep into your domain?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Of course. Taking the potential damage to the town into consideration, we had the option of fighting along the border. But if we did that, they could argue later on that it was legitimate self-defense against a monster raid. If it&rsquo;s within our territory, however, such a claim would be declared baseless, and the Western Nations would no doubt be instilled with a sense of crisis. The evacuation of the inn town inhabitants was completed successfully and now that they&rsquo;ve crossed our border, we have a casus belli for fighting them.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel roared with laughter. &lsaquo;Fuhahaha! It&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;ve finally learned the art of reading between the lines, but you lost points for saying it aloud, you know?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though I took a stab at arousing his interest, all I received in return was that terrible reply. That was my initial impression, but then he continued to speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Be that as it may, I don&rsquo;t like sitting on my hands, especially when military affairs are involved&mdash;issues are bound to occur when misunderstandings happen. Therefore, I will make this as clear as possible: the Jura-Tempest Federation will be in charge of negotiations with the Empire. After that, if it&rsquo;s decided that war is inevitable, I shall declare that the Armed Nation of Dwargon will participate as an ally of Tempest. In order to avoid any confusion with the chain of command during the war, Dwargon will remain more on the defensive side&mdash;is that okay?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ooh, that answer was clearer than I&rsquo;d expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Since the Dwarven Kingdom held the position of absolute neutrality, I thought that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to intrude unless it was </span><span class="c2">their</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;territory being invaded. This was what Benimaru and others had already anticipated, so I obviously accepted his offer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Thank you. It&rsquo;s reassuring to hear that.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Cut it out. I know you&rsquo;ve expected this outcome from the start. Well, this tactic is the safest approach for Dwargon, but since it is a crisis for our ally, this does make sense. In times of emergency, you can always count on me.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Man, he really is reliable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We had the backing of Dwargon, which had never been defeated in over a thousand years. Having a place we could escape to as a last resort enabled us to fight with peace of mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Then, we will send a messenger as planned.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Our country needs to divide our army into two in order to protect the center and the east. It is also convenient for us to lean more towards defense. Also, be careful. The war potential of the new type of weapon you call a &ldquo;tank&rdquo; has yet to be discovered. Judging by the equipment of the Imperial soldiers, the era of the sword might be coming to a close. Forgive me for imposing such a dangerous role on you.&rsaquo; Gazel cautioned as if he were worried about us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Certainly, I couldn&rsquo;t tell him to ease up because, as Gazel just noted, the performance of the magic tanks was an unknown factor. Hence, despite thinking it was unnecessary, I decided to warn Gazel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;There were weapons called &ldquo;tanks&rdquo; in my previous world too. They used the energy of exploding gunpowder to propel the shell forward. While the principle itself is simple, the actual mechanism is complicated. The shells&rsquo; power, range, and accuracy were unfathomable. If the magic tanks developed by the Empire incorporated a similar mechanism, then we might not be able to deal with them using existing tactics.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like Gazel alluded to before, the age of the sword was probably over. And that would potentially bring forth a bloodier battlefield. Furthermore, what if magic was used instead of gunpowder to fire the shells?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I let Raphael-san run some simulations, and the results that it calculated terrified me. Based on the magic formula you inputted, it was apparently feasible to produce magical shells that were overwhelmingly more powerful than tanks that were the culmination of modern-day science.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And worse, it was a kinetic projectile weapon&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that render the anti-magic &lsquo;Defense Barrier&rsquo; meaningless?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s right. I believe we require not only &lsquo;Magic Barrier&rsquo;, but also &lsquo;Magic Wall&rsquo;. Moreover, since the tanks are expected to have considerable power, I think it&rsquo;s better to implement &lsquo;Conjure Earth Wall&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reinforce Structure&rsquo; together. We can double or triple our defensive strength by using trenches and earth walls.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;So that&rsquo;s how it is, huh? Everyone was thinking the same thing&hellip;We were also working on the development of the &lsquo;Magic Armored Soldiers&rsquo; to cope with the new era. Even though we have obviously been beaten to the draw, it&rsquo;s not my place to complain. In any case, do you think you can win?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a difficult question to answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why all I could reply with were the words, &lsaquo;It&rsquo;s not about whether we can win or not; &ldquo;We will win no matter what!&rdquo; is the only thing I can say.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel, and even the people around me, seemed very satisfied with my declaration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Fuh-fuhahahahaha! What a dependable guy! May the fortunes of war be in your favor!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yes, leave it to me!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After our exchange, I ended the call with Gazel. This final check had been perfect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the confirmation we needed, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It should suffice. He has ultimately assured us that we are free to do whatever we want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded, relieved at Benimaru&rsquo;s reply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The time had come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">At this point, we didn&rsquo;t need to wait for the Empire to move anymore. </span><span class="c2">Now that we&rsquo;re ready, let&rsquo;s formally start the war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Justice was on our side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Imperial Army had invaded deep into territory afforded to me as a demon lord&mdash;the Great Jura Forest. This was an unacceptable state of affairs. Next, our plan was to negotiate like we were in a state of panic from emergency preparations&mdash;this would ensure that the other side remained oblivious to the fact that we were aware of everything. Thus, who should I send?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta and Gabil were boorish and, above all, unfit for negotiations. Especially Gabil&hellip; When I recalled my first ever encounter with him, I had believed that he was ill-suited to be sent out as a messenger. If that was the case, there was only one person who fit the bill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided to assign Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, if it was her, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about her dying, even if the Empire ignored negotiations and proceeded to attack. Even though it was all staged, this meeting was still necessary. In my opinion, it was okay to launch a preemptive attack without any forewarning, but presentation was important for a demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After being embroiled in my thoughts, I activated &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; to give the decisive command.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

They hadn&rsquo;t entered the cave and were instead camped in the plaza&rsquo;s outer edge. The evacuation of the inn town&rsquo;s residents was completed successfully, and now they were waiting for the Empire&rsquo;s next move. No messengers had arrived yet from the Empire, and there was no recommendation to surrender. However, the people gathered here could feel firsthand that war was imminent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Dwarven Army was also busy preparing for war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Royal Order of the Dwarven Palace had seven units, two of which were the Engineering Unit and Magical Support Unit. Soldiers affiliated with those two were busy reinforcing the gate and constructing a temporary wall. An earthen wall built using earth magic would quickly become harder than a brick paired with fire magic. If it was reinforced further, a barrier as strong as iron would be created.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Work on the third wall outside of the gate went smoothly, and by the time it was finished, the Heavily-Armored Strike Force Unit began to move out. Troops of the Heavily-Armored Strike Force Unit, whose entire bodies were encased in magical armor, lined up with nimble movements that belied their otherwise weighty appearance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The war situation seemed to have progressed a bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nonetheless, Gobta and others didn&rsquo;t mind the change. Giving only a sidelong glance at the bustling dwarves, the members of the First and Third Corps relaxed without a care in the world. Gobta and Gabil were sitting on the floor, peacefully eating together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next to them, for some reason, was a table set up with a luxurious parasol. Near it were Testarossa and Ultima seated in pure white chairs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were enjoying teatime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px;"><img alt="" src="images/image9.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person serving them was Veyron, who was dressed like a butler. Although he looked old, his back was ramrod straight. His posture was beautiful and stood perfectly still like a statue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is crazy good! This is one heck of a wild dish! I love it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhmm! I am satisfied with it as well. The more you chew, the more the flavor exudes&mdash;it has an exquisite texture and marvelous taste!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The food that Gobta and the others were busy eating had been prepared by Ultima&rsquo;s servant, Zonda. It was broiled bone-in meat seasoned only with salt and herbs. This dish wasn&rsquo;t something that had been officially supplied, but rather made possible with Zonda&rsquo;s catch from his hunting trip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m truly honored as a chef to hear these praises from you, the corps commanders. I am a royal cook, so camping food like this is still something I need to improve on. Please forgive me if there is anything that dissatisfies you.&rdquo; Zonda added with a graceful bow, then stepped back to Ultima&rsquo;s side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The double-breasted chef jacket Zonda had on was a splendid piece of clothing, specially made by Shuna. It was made of silk fabric from hell moths and dyed in the same shade of light purple as Zonda&rsquo;s hair. Since everyone was wearing armor and military uniforms, Zonda stood out like a sore thumb.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Testarossa and Ultima were dressed in custom-made military uniforms. Testarossa&rsquo;s attire was a trouser type and Ultima&rsquo;s dress was a skirt type, but they had an undoubtedly militaristic appearance; thus, it came as no surprise that Zonda was the odd man out. Zonda&rsquo;s sophisticated mannerisms seemed out of place on the battlefield. You could even feel the elegance radiating from him, yet Zonda had become an indispensable individual. This was mainly due to the fact that he still taught others how to cook on the battlefield, and ultimately won everyone&rsquo;s stomach over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, another reason why Zonda could act freely was because of his position as Ultima&rsquo;s servant. Ultima herself had a freewheeling personality and made extensive use of her authority as an adviser to Commander Gabil. Her stately attitude repelled all complaints from other monsters. Ultima had already turned into a celebrity in the country of monsters. Only a handful of people had the courage to converse with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This does not fit my taste. There are not enough options; I would have liked to see more variety.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&ldquo;I guess I agree with that too. Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re cutting corners a bit too much by only grilling or cooking stew? You&rsquo;ve finally been acquainted with Shuna-san and Yoshida-shi</span><sup class="c5 c18"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c1">, so why don&rsquo;t you sharpen up your skills some more and make yourself useful to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Contrary to Gobta and Gabil&rsquo;s praise, Testarossa and Ultima gave it a thumbs down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am terribly sorry.&rdquo; Zonda apologized with sincerity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Gabil called out to Zonda, &ldquo;No, no, Zonda-dono. I believe that Ultima-dono recognizes your skills as a cook! The problem might not be the taste.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s sudden remark drew the eyes of everyone around him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa had an expression of interest on her face, whereas Ultima looked displeased because her words were being challenged. Zonda, on the other hand, was shaken as this might incur his mistress&rsquo;s wrath. Veyron was composed and displayed no emotions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amidst this unfolding scene, Gobta, who couldn&rsquo;t read the mood, asked, &ldquo;Whaddya mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you for asking, Gobta-dono! This is related to something my sister often berates me for. She told me that I should try to see things from a woman&rsquo;s perspective more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And what does that mean?&rdquo; Gobta questioned again, taking an emphatic bite of the meat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It means exactly that, Gobta-dono. We can eat our food unabashedly without worrying about what people around us think. Yet, Testarossa-dono and Ultima-dono cannot afford such luxuries.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After hearing that, Zonda finally understood what Gabil was trying to convey and murmured, &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; He was seemingly convinced. Zonda came to the conclusion that he had neglected a fundamental concept because he never needed to eat prior to his incarnation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Food was not all always about taste.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh, it&rsquo;s not like you, Gabil-san, to have an amazing perspective like that!&rdquo; praised Gobta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, I am just trying my best,&rdquo; Gabil modestly denied. &ldquo;With that being said, that was actually Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s words&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil then revealed a conversation he had with Rimuru a while back when he sought some advice&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to be popular with girls like you, Rimuru-sama&hellip; What should I do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking </span><span class="c2">me</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;about that? Personally, it&rsquo;s because I have the appearance of a chil&mdash;no, never mind. Gabil-kun, let me share some of my wisdom with you. A certain degree of delicacy is required if you want to be popular with women. If you can do that, then they will naturally like you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Gabil proudly recited the discussion he had with Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And then, I remembered Souka&rsquo;s words. I realized that the lesson Rimuru-sama tried to impart was something crucial: don&rsquo;t do things that will make the other party dislike you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Everyone was impressed by Gabil&rsquo;s assertion and thought to themselves, </span><span class="c2">Rimuru-sama sure is brilliant! </span><span class="c1">Rimuru definitely would&rsquo;ve blushed from embarrassment had he been here in person and overheard this conversation, but fortunately, he wasn&rsquo;t. There was no one who could stop Gabil from monopolizing the story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zonda appeared in front of Ultima and Testarossa and gave a beautiful bow. He then knelt down and began to speak. &ldquo;My apologies, Ultima-sama and Testarossa-sama. I promise that from now on I will do my best to serve dishes that meet your expectations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh my, you have such an excellent servant. As for my servants&hellip;&rdquo; Testarossa trailed off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you talking about? Moss appears very useful, you know? Also, seeing how you&rsquo;ve entrusted Cien to be your proxy means he&rsquo;s good at paperwork, right? My servants are more into physical-related stuff, so I envy you for having a servant who can handle such miscellaneous tasks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose you are right, Ult. We cannot help but ask for something we do not possess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa and Ultima continued their conversation, completely ignoring the kneeling Zonda. Their attitude seemed cold to Gobta and those watching, but it was actually the opposite. These ladies, who were the pinnacle of demons, seldom paid attention to others, let alone praised them. Knowing that, Veyron and Zonda, the objects of their discussion, were tremendously nervous. Yet, at the same time, they felt a burning exaltation in their souls with the realization that their lords had recognized them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, one person failed to read the mood. It was Gobta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Women sure are picky. It&rsquo;s annoying&mdash;wishing for food to be cut into bite-sized pieces so they&rsquo;re easier to eat. I get what you&rsquo;re saying, Gabil-san, but really, what a pain!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gobta-dono, even if that is your honest opinion, you shouldn&rsquo;t say something like that out loud,&rdquo; Gabil admonished. &ldquo;According to what I learned from Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s advice, that&rsquo;s the first step to becoming a gentleman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I already know that. But this is a battlefield. Eat when you can; don&rsquo;t ask for too much. This is what I think is right in this situation as a commander!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anything is fine as long as you can eat it</span><span class="c1">&mdash;or so Gobta believed. What&rsquo;s more, they were on a battlefield, so when a person said something selfish, he wanted to give his candid opinion on it. Being appointed corps commander imparted Gobta with a sense of responsibility. There was also his desire to act cool in front of his subordinates, hence his outspoken comment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What Gobta pronounced was right. His reasoning was justified. Be that as it may, there were certain individuals in this world where reasoning simply didn&rsquo;t work. Gobta should&rsquo;ve kept that in mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gobta-kun, you&rsquo;re super funny! I&rsquo;m getting chills!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, truly. It&rsquo;s good that I&rsquo;m in charge of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Ultima and Testarossa both responded with a smile, yet something was amiss&mdash;the smile was nowhere to be seen in their eyes. </span><span class="c2">Ah, this is the end for him</span><span class="c1">&mdash;everyone besides Gobta had the same notion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-wait, Gobta-san. Corps Commander Gobta? I believe that was enough. I&rsquo;m sure the military intelligence officers have already figured it out&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person who hurriedly stopped Gobta was Gobchi, one of his adjutants. Since they&rsquo;d known each other for a long time, Gobchi was aware that Gobta had no ill intentions and was merely giving his honest opinion. Gobta&rsquo;s statement wasn&rsquo;t necessarily incorrect, either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, one could not live in this world just by being right. There were people to whom such orthodoxy didn&rsquo;t apply. Gobchi was a man who could read the room, so he knew better than to potentially offend these two dangerous ladies. After all, no sane person would leisurely enjoy teatime out on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gobta-san, don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s a bad idea lecturing these individuals?!</span><span class="c1">&mdash;this was what Gobchi was currently thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like Gobchi predicted, Gobta found himself in a remarkably dangerous situation. Testarossa and Ultima weren&rsquo;t seriously angry with Gobta. They simply thought of him as an interesting toy. However, becoming a toy for these primordial demons could only mean&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta&rsquo;s fate was hanging on by a thread.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, a miracle occurred.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ah, Testarossa? Can I talk to you right now?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru had contacted Testarossa via &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; at a perfect time. With this, Gobta was saved from a terrible future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That will not be an issue. So, Rimuru-sama, how may I help you?&rsaquo; Testarossa immediately responded as she knelt down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who saw the sudden change in Testarossa&rsquo;s behavior quickly figured out that she had received a &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; from Rimuru. It didn&rsquo;t take long for them to follow suit. Rimuru was utterly oblivious to what was happening out there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ah, yeah. Wait a sec, okay?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After saying that in a rather laid-back manner, he connected the &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; to Gobta and Gabil as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Are we all here?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yep!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;It&rsquo;s fine on my end!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta, Gabil, and Testarossa could feel Rimuru nodding to their replies. Then, what Rimuru announced next caught them all by surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I had a meeting with King Gazel just now. It&rsquo;s been decided that Tempest will be the vanguard against the Empire, but before that, we need to negotiate with them first.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He mentioned how he really wanted to launch a preemptive attack, but ultimately planned to give them at least one chance to surrender. Next, Rimuru explained his agreement with Gazel. The three listened to the entire report without speaking a single word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterwards&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;So, Rimuru-sama. It would be better if I went to handle the negotiations, right?&rsaquo; the quick-witted Testarossa inquired.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her question had been a form of confirmation, but to her, it was already a done deal. The problem was how to bring the negotiation to a conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ooh, that&rsquo;s right. You&rsquo;ll still be the diplomatic attach&eacute; here, so I&rsquo;m elevating you to the position of plenipotentiary. I&rsquo;ll allow you to consult with me anytime through &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo;, and your position will be equal to that of a corps commander, so I want you to work well with Gobta and Gabil.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;As you wish.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa was dispatched as a supervisor, just like Ultima, but she also held the position of commander of the Western Reserve Force. Even though this corps didn&rsquo;t have a role to play in this battle, their military might was one of the greatest when compared to Tempest&rsquo;s other units. She was on the same level as Gobta and Gabil in terms of authority, and calling her the perfect individual to become Tempest&rsquo;s emissary wouldn&rsquo;t be too far-fetched by any stretch of the imagination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Y-yeah. You know, it will be dangerous to enter the Empire&rsquo;s territory even as our messenger. Is that fine with you?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru had asked Testarossa quite worriedly, but she happily accepted, nonetheless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;There will not be any problems. I will show the people of the Empire, who do not know their place, the majesty of Rimuru-sama.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;R-really? If possible, I&rsquo;d like to avoid war at all cost, but that might be a fool&rsquo;s errand. If that&rsquo;s the case, then&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;We shall treat the Empire as our enemy and exterminate them.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;&mdash;Huh?! No, wait&mdash;well, I guess so, but&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Please leave it to me. Idiots who ignore the ultimatum issued by the merciful Rimuru-sama clearly do not deserve to live in this world. I shall destroy them all.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa was raring to kill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Gabil, sensing her murderous motivation, was taken aback, and thought to himself, </span><span class="c2">I kind of don&rsquo;t want to get involved with this terrifying woman!</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Gobta, on the other hand, was still quite something else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Rimuru-sama, don&rsquo;t ya worry. Testarossa-san is clearly saying something brave like this because she&rsquo;s in high spirits from being on her first battlefield. I&rsquo;ll accompany and support her properly, so rest easy!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He declared to Rimuru, completely failing to read the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&lsaquo;Eh, </span><span class="c2">you</span><span class="c1">?!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Of course. As a corps commander, my position comes with a lot of responsibility. Protecting fragile women is also a part of my duty!&rsaquo; Gobta proudly proclaimed to the dumbfounded Rimuru. Meanwhile, Testarossa gave a bitter smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This kid&hellip;is stupid, but I don&rsquo;t dislike him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa was amazed that someone could misunderstand her to this extent. She had never tried to hide her brutality, yet Gobta didn&rsquo;t notice it at all, so she thought it was only fair to recognize his boldness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I-I see. Then, I&rsquo;ll send Ranga too, so escort Testarossa with Ranga. It&rsquo;d be nice if the Empire agreed to our demands. If they don&rsquo;t, the war will commence on the spot&mdash;be careful not to die, okay?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Leave it to me. I&rsquo;m great at escaping!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Is that right? Then, I&rsquo;ll leave it to you!&rsaquo; Rimuru declared and hung up the &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c38"><span class="c1">Thus, the sortie of the monster army was decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone fell silent and was watching the scene&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s finally my time to shine! Let&rsquo;s clean up quickly and go!&rdquo; Gobta&rsquo;s command roared through the crowd. The monster army started to move at once.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

I couldn&rsquo;t say that I was in a hurry to respond to the situation. No, well, I guess it </span><span class="c2">would</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;be normal if you thought about it. Acting flustered was definitely not the way to go if we wanted to demonstrate the authority of a demon lord. I felt that their approach was the correct way of going about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyways, Testarossa was reliable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed like she would sonorously show off my dignity to the Empire. She did mention something along the lines of how she&rsquo;d annihilate the Imperial troops, but she didn&rsquo;t really mean it, right? No, of course not&hellip; But then again, Testarossa was cut from the same cloth as Diablo. And that meant she was undoubtedly a problem child, so her being totally serious was pretty likely, huh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since primordials were crazy dangerous, we should probably stop her&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s too late for that</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was war, and pitying your enemies was something you did after you won.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was also an unexpected windfall, and it was Gobta&rsquo;s growth. Thanks to the fact that I gave him a position of responsibility, he was trying to carry out his duties rather seriously. He had become a fine man. The more Gobta grew, the more I&rsquo;d be able to slack off. Even though I want him to keep doing his best, I&rsquo;m afraid that he was close to stepping on a land mine. It&rsquo;d be amusing to wait and see what would happen, but it&rsquo;d be for the best to reveal the truth to Gobta before Testarossa truly got angry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While thinking that, I asked, &ldquo;Ranga, are you there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; he exclaimed and jumped out of my shadow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His wagging tail was so cute. I was tempted to brush it and take a nap right then and there, but I restrained myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ranga, accompany Gobta and protect him if anything happens.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ranga&rsquo;s tail stopped swaying. After a moment of silence, Ranga replied in a disheartened tone. &ldquo;&hellip;Understood, my lord. Then, when do you want me to go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His reaction sounded somewhat like a child who didn&rsquo;t want to leave. I could guess what he was currently thinking, but my orders remained unchanged. Given the uncertainty surrounding the Empire&rsquo;s strength, sending Gobta alone worried me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please go now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, I shall be off&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Ranga prepared himself to leave, looking dejected. </span><span class="c2">Does he really hate being away from me that much?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt a little sorry, but I wanted him to hang in there. With that in mind, I told Ranga, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting on you. Gobta himself is becoming more reliable, but I&rsquo;ll feel better knowing you&rsquo;re with him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, suddenly&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me, my lord!&rdquo; Ranga promised, bright and full of motivation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My mere words had transformed his dull gait into an energetic gallop. Besides, Ranga could use &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo;, so he had plenty of time before Gobta and the others departed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the time being, I felt a bit relieved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, negotiations with the Empire will inevitably break down,&rdquo; I reminded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll declare war on the spot, and the war will start immediately. In that case, how should we line up our forces?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Testarossa&rsquo;s words and actions alone, there was no doubt that war would break out. I really wanted to avoid it, but this was wishful thinking. Since they&rsquo;ve already gone this far and invaded our country, I didn&rsquo;t expect them to leave without a fight. At the very least, we needed to fight them once to display our strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the opponent had an unknown force&mdash;their tank unit. Making a careless move meant it could backfire greatly on us, so we had to consider our strategy carefully. Of course, it was times like these when Benimaru stepped up and showed his mettle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Testarossa&rsquo;s negotiation reveals that war is imminent,&rdquo; Benimaru added, &ldquo;then we&rsquo;ll isolate the city inside the labyrinth straight away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, calling Ramiris will be a good idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Since we are so close to the start of the war, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll be bored.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was something wrong with you when you thought of war as a form of entertainment. I guess the way monsters perceived things was inherently different from humans when it came to these things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The city would be protected by our best defense mechanism&mdash;the labyrinth&mdash;as planned. And since we were on our home turf, we would be able to take the initiative. The problem was Gobta and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Under normal circumstances, there would be too much of a difference between our forces. However, the enemy is one large mass, and you can think of a tank as a monster. In that case, the advantage is on our side.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s confident attitude told us that we didn&rsquo;t have to take into account the accompanying supply unit. Although I had my reservations, his words were rather convincing, so I decided to listen to the rest of what he had to say first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;On the other hand, if we deploy troops on a large scale, they will become easy prey for the tank&rsquo;s guns. I&rsquo;ve calculated their estimated power based on Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s imagery intelligence and deduced that the Green Numbers won&rsquo;t be able to hold out against them. Therefore, the Goblin Riders will be the first to face the Imperial Army.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Eh? Isn&rsquo;t that a little harsh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to challenge them with only a hundred riders?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do first in order to gauge their strength. If the enemy tanks are as good as I anticipated, we can win if we send in the entire army,&rdquo; Benimaru explained with a cool expression, &ldquo;but if their strength exceeds my expectations, then we will have to re-examine our strategy at that point. Either way, we have to fight them, and increasing the number of individuals acting as guinea pigs isn&rsquo;t fun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Basically, this meant using Gobta and others as a benchmark. If anything went wrong, the Goblin Riders under Gobta would turn into sacrificial pawns. Yet, Benimaru was unshaken. He made a cold-hearted calculation that this would be the most efficient way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In a worst-case scenario, what will happen to Gobta and the others?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They have already been instructed to escape using &lsquo;Shadow Step&rsquo; at their own discretion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I see&hellip; That&rsquo;s why we couldn&rsquo;t move the Green Numbers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru predicted the tanks&rsquo; performance based on my memory, or rather, my knowledge. It was pretty vague thanks to the fact that it came primarily from what I saw on TV. However, I had a strong ally&mdash;Raphael-sensei&mdash;so I believe I was able to determine fairly accurate specs, despite my hazy memory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition to that, we had now seen through the Imperial tanks. We extrapolated important information such as the caliber and diameter of the cannon, and the machine guns that appeared to serve as a secondary weapon. These were likely based on the knowledge of otherworlders, so they should be similar in function. Although their power and performance were unknown, I figured that what we needed to remain wary of was still the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s conjecture and Raphael-sensei&rsquo;s calculation results were within the margin of error, so there was nothing wrong with Benimaru&rsquo;s approach to the operation. I mean, it was better than what I&mdash;an amateur&mdash;could ever come up with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was Benimaru&rsquo;s plan:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, as soon as the battle began, 100 riders would charge all at once. Taking advantage of their high-speed maneuverability, they wouldn&rsquo;t give the tank gunners a chance to aim through unpredictable movements. This way, they wouldn&rsquo;t have to endure a direct hit&mdash;at least in theory. Since it was a small unit, they could respond to any situation. If they were lucky enough, they could use hit-and-run tactics to lead the enemy around by the nose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was convinced after being presented with the explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you get scared, you lose</span><span class="c1">&mdash;Benimaru had apparently explained this to Gobta and the others. Of course, you never knew what would happen on the battlefield. The enemy might do something reckless, which could result in a lucky hit against our troops. Although we said that they wouldn&rsquo;t die as long as they avoided a direct hit, we couldn&rsquo;t be sure until the moment of truth arrived. And it was for this reason that everyone was made ready to withdraw immediately if things fell apart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, retreating is a last resort. I will not permit any actions that bring shame on Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s prestige.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was scarier than the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make them do something reckless, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be impossible. It is common courtesy to do everything in order to win,&rdquo; Benimaru replied with a bright smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no hesitation in his expression; it was quite admirable, but I had mixed feelings. I understood where Benimaru was coming from, yet at the same time, it sounded like our only option was to sacrifice someone. I was indifferent to my prestige; although, having such a thing would indeed preserve our nation&rsquo;s dignity. However, if we had to sacrifice people in order to protect that dignity, then weren&rsquo;t we getting our priorities backwards?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t want any of my friends to get hurt&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Let&rsquo;s assume the worst and ensure that the Third Corps can reinforce them through &lsquo;Transfer&rsquo;. </span><span class="c2">If I was the one fighting, I wouldn&rsquo;t be this worried&mdash;</span><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel anxious.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

For this expedition, he was charged with commanding the &lsquo;Magic Tank Division&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lying on his back atop a state-of-the-art command post vehicle located in the rear, he was enjoying the air of the battlefield. There was no change in the large forest that surrounded him, and the path ahead was clear. Gaster, who had grown used to this familiar sight, thought of the fame that he would gain from this battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I shall overthrow the thousand-year undefeated Dwarven Kingdom</span><span class="c5">&mdash;</span><span class="c2">the Armed Nation of Dwargon ruled by the famed Champion King Gazel. There&rsquo;s nothing more exhilarating than this!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster imagined a roaring round of applause. His name would go down in history as a newly emerged champion for future generations to read about. Just the sheer thought of it filled Gaster&rsquo;s heart with excitement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The man who defeated Champion King Gazel</span><span class="c1">&mdash;the title would be his for the taking. It was a story in the not-too-distant future; a preordained turn of events that was certain to become a reality. After all, Lieutenant General Gaster led the &lsquo;Magic Tank Division&rsquo;, and they definitely had the strength to back up his ambition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The 2,000 magic tanks all lined up with perfect coordination. In the grassy plains at the base of the mountain, Gaster was blessed with a majestic view: a 100 by 20 array of tanks sat waiting at the ready. However, this had already been taken into account by his opponent. Each tank measured about 10 meters long and 35 meters wide, and since there were 2,000 tanks, a sizable space was required to deploy them all. Gaster positioned his division based on reconnaissance that they had conducted beforehand, and it matched perfectly with where Rimuru and the others had expected them to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although Gaster was completely unaware of this, he was still an excellent soldier. His exceptional individual fighting ability reflected his position as a lieutenant general. Gaster himself was confident that he could hold his own against an Imperial Knight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The only reason I didn&rsquo;t become an Imperial Knight is because I never have the chance to participate in Rank Battles. As long as I&rsquo;m in charge of this division, I&rsquo;m stuck in a constant state of military action&mdash;</span><span class="c5">Gaster thought to himself, annoyed</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Needless to say, lieutenant general was still a high-ranking position. It was a status possessed only by a handful of individuals in the Empire, equivalent to an upper-class noble. It wasn&rsquo;t an exaggeration to say that Gaster&rsquo;s existence was beyond the reach of ordinary people, yet he remained unsatisfied. Eventually, he would replace Calgurio and rise to become a corps commander. And then, he would become a champion. Gaster&rsquo;s ambition was insatiable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster desired not money, but prestige. This was why he volunteered for a decisive battle with Champion King Gazel instead of conquering the labyrinth. More importantly, Gaster was capable enough to entertain such aspirations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He possessed the ability to control sounds&mdash;thanks to his Unique Skill &lsquo;Musician&rsquo;&mdash;which allowed him to analyze situations in detail by simply listening to various noises. He could also issue specific instructions using special waves, enabling him to command allies even in the middle of a heated battle. It was perfectly suited for presiding over a corps, but that wasn&rsquo;t the only thing worth mentioning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unique Skill &lsquo;Musician&rsquo; also hid a vicious means of attack&mdash;manipulating sound waves and irradiating a target with it. In other words, Gaster wielded the power of a sonic cannon and could destroy cells through sheer brute force. Gaster was undoubtedly one of the strongest in the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hmph! I admit that the imperial guards are strong. But that&rsquo;s only because they have the legendary-grade gear given by His Imperial Majesty! I deserve to have such gear&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster was confident that all he had to do to earn the highest honor of being a &ldquo;Single Digit&rdquo; was to wear legendary-grade armor.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though Gaster was immersed in his thoughts, he still kept his guard up during the operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hmm? The atmosphere of the forest changed&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ambient noise that surrounded him suddenly died down. As soon as Gaster noticed it, he began barking orders at the entire army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Halt encampment preparations and get ready immediately!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Gaster shouted his command, he concentrated his attention on the forest to his left. The gentle clamor of animals and birds had disappeared. Even the insects were silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a tense feeling in the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then&mdash;small footsteps. Furthermore, he could hear the sound of rustling leaves getting closer and closer. The source was far away, yet it was moving quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Are they aiming for a surprise attack? It&rsquo;s not a bad move, but they&rsquo;re against the worst possible matchup.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Gaster couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Based on what he could hear, he deduced that around 100 individuals were approaching. There had been information that said the demon lord&rsquo;s army was gathering in the inn town, and it seemed like that was where they had come from. This was proof that Calgurio&rsquo;s plan was proceeding smoothly. The demon lord&rsquo;s army stationed at the inn town had failed to notice the Imperial Army&rsquo;s main force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">How will the monsters react when a 700,000-strong army appears, poised like a knife held to the demon lord&rsquo;s throat?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Gaster grinned as he imagined the scenario.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sounds had approached the ten-kilometer mark. They would soon be within the effective range of their magic guns. Although its maximum range was 30 kilometers, accuracy suffered with that distance. The guns could technically reach that far, but the actual effective range was three kilometers. However, if you used a special exploding shell, you wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about the lack of accuracy. There were only a few enemies, and they were advancing while packed together in a narrow area. They probably thought they could use the trees as shields if they didn&rsquo;t go out in the open&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">How naive. First, let&rsquo;s welcome them with a barrage to liven things up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The special shells were still in the prototype stage, and only two shots had been prepared, but the blast area was still several dozen meters. Its explosive power far exceeded conventional explosive magic. The terrain would deform under the blast and heat of tens of thousands of degrees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although Gaster&rsquo;s command vehicle was the only one that featured this remarkable item, Gaster had no qualms about putting it into use. He promptly loaded it and pointed the muzzle at the forest. Then, he gave instructions to the entire tank division: prepare to intercept in case the enemy fled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Left wing battalion, turn counterclockwise!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers were setting up tents for the camp, but they remained alert given how the Dwarven Kingdom was only 30 kilometers away. Upon hearing Gaster&rsquo;s command, they began to calmly clean up and stored their things on carts that were being towed by the tanks. Soon after, everyone was prepared for battle. Therefore, without a moment&rsquo;s delay to Gaster&rsquo;s orders, the left-wing battalion&mdash;comprised of 500 tanks&mdash;floated in the air and pointed their bodies toward the woods.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, Gaster and his men were ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was almost like they had been waiting. From the depths of the overgrown forest, a single monster emerged: a wolf-like monster with two horns on its forehead. Its massive figure was imposing. It was about five meters long, and it was comparable to a tank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That monster is most definitely &ldquo;Ranga&rdquo; as reported by the intelligence department. Apparently, it is the Demon Lord&rsquo;s pet, or whatever the hell they call it, but its ability is equivalent to A-plus rank</span><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a powerful being.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just one? What are they planning&hellip; No, I get it now.&rdquo; Gaster thought about the reason behind this visit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Coming alone means that it&rsquo;s not here for a fight. Perhaps it came here to warn us. That&rsquo;s right, in order to protect his position as Demon Lord, he can&rsquo;t just abase himself in front of his enemies. Kukuku, how foolish. </span><span class="c1">Gaster interpreted this as an attempt to intimidate the enemy with the big monster named Ranga and drain their will to fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems that Demon Lord Rimuru is quite prideful. Is he giving up the element of surprise just to protect his dignity as a demon lord?&rdquo; Gaster said with a loud laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The officers chuckled along with that remark, and the nervousness among the soldiers dissolved. The level of tension became just right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ranga edged closer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His footsteps were calm and showed no signs of belligerence. As Gaster had guessed, his goal was to negotiate. Ranga finally stopped once he was about ten meters away&mdash;a stone&rsquo;s throw from Gaster and his crew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A woman, who was perched sideways atop, jumped down gracefully from his back, all without making a single sound. Then, without showing any signs of hesitation, she walked up to Gaster and the others. Gaster felt a chill run down his spine as if he&rsquo;d been hit by an ice blade the moment he laid eyes on the woman&rsquo;s unearthly beauty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">What the&hellip;? This lady has a strange sound&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thudding of a beating heart was there, but it played an eerie melody. He could also hear her bloodstream, yet it was quieter and faster than a human&rsquo;s. No, it was way too fast. The human body wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to withstand such speeds if blood circulated at that rate&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster no longer paid any attention to Ranga. He only stared at the woman. Her long, pure white hair flowed flawlessly, accentuating her beauty. However, she was dressed in an imposing military uniform that contradicted her elegance. Her pants looked like jodhpurs, which were comfortably loose around her thighs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was another person on Ranga&rsquo;s back, but Gaster hadn&rsquo;t realized it. This was how much the woman&rsquo;s eerie presence had consumed Gaster&rsquo;s focus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Who is she&hellip;? There was no mention of her on the intelligence reports. This woman might be more dangerous than Ranga, who is considered to be an executive!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster wanted to give the information bureau a piece of his mind. Unfortunately, there was no one here to complain to. The fact that the Demon Lord&rsquo;s aides had appeared right now was far more important than his grievances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster spoke to the woman in a dignified manner as if to hide the fact that he felt pressured. &ldquo;Are you a messenger of Demon Lord Rimuru? You came quicker than I expected, but I suppose subordinates of demon lords are excellent. So, what can I do for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The woman returned a gracious smile to Gaster&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;It is my pleasure to meet you all. My </span><span class="c2">name</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is Testarossa. I am the retainer of the great Demon Lord Rimuru-sama, ruler of this land. Now, regarding the reason why I came here&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The smile on the mouth of the woman&mdash;Testarossa&mdash;deepened as she introduced herself. It was a very, very wicked smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&ldquo;I wish to convey the words of my lord to you: </span><span class="c2">If you leave now, I will let you do so. However, if you intrude any further, I will show you no mercy,</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; Testarossa declared, her crimson eyes shining brighter than blood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster swallowed heavily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was about to shout, &ldquo;What the hell are you spouting!&rdquo; but Testarossa moved before he could do that. She waved her hand lightly and, at that moment, a wall of fire materialized one meter in front of the first row of tanks. The wall of flame quickly vanished, but a glassy scorch mark remained on the ground, drawing a single line.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You already understand, don&rsquo;t you? If you cross that line, your lives are forfeit. Make sure every man that enters is prepared to die. Well then, good day,&rdquo; Testarossa finished with a graceful bow, heedless of the situation at hand. Then, she abruptly turned on her heels as if she had lost interest and began walking away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the signal that negotiations had ended. Ranga wagged his tail like it was the most natural thing to do. Only the small figure swaying on his back glanced at Gaster and the others, but Gaster paid him no mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">H-how dare you make a fool of me! Who do you think I am?! Moreover, you better not get carried away by your bluff in front of such a great force!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster was enraged. He felt as if everything he had believed in so far had been shattered, and instantly lost his composure. They unilaterally said whatever was on their mind and didn&rsquo;t even listen to what Gaster and the others had to say. The Empire should&rsquo;ve been the ones behaving this way when dealing with the enemy, not the other way around. That&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The messenger&rsquo;s attitude ignited Gaster&rsquo;s anger, and the fear he felt until then had disappeared. As a result, Gaster made the wrong decision. Testarossa was five meters away. She was right in between Ranga and Gaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I won&rsquo;t let you walk away this easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster steeled his resolve. Showing courtesy to a messenger wasn&rsquo;t something the Empire concerned itself with. It was okay if they surrendered. Otherwise, we simply had to completely trample them. In that case, Testarossa&rsquo;s behavior was an insult to the Empire, and hence a good reason to start the war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Can you hear me?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yes sir! Loud and clear.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Shoot that impertinent woman in the head. Then commence firing at once with the 20 tanks that turned around in the frontmost row. Show off the power of the Empire to the monsters lurking in the forest!&rsaquo; Gaster secretly ordered using his &lsquo;Musician&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first to react was a sniper assigned to the command vehicle. He quickly set up the sniper rifle and immediately aimed at Testarossa. Then, a silent bullet was fired from the long-range &ldquo;spell gun&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The modified long-range version of the small magic weapon &ldquo;spell gun&rdquo; had a range of up to two kilometers. At this distance of less than ten meters, it was a guaranteed kill. The bullet contained the elemental magic &lsquo;Fireball&rsquo;, which brought up an interesting question: what would happen if it activated inside a person&rsquo;s body?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Needless to say, the target would be burned from the inside out and explode in flames. Even monsters with high magic resistance were often defenseless inside their bodies. There was no way to escape from bullets that exceeded the speed of sound, and thus Testarossa&rsquo;s death was certain&mdash;or so Gaster believed. The moment the bullet was fired and passed over the scorched line&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa turned around. Her facial expression was beautifully wicked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster&rsquo;s eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The assassin&rsquo;s bullet that was supposed to pierce through Testarossa&rsquo;s body had been stopped by her delicate index finger. A bullet imbued with magic that had an initial velocity three times the speed of sound. Its hidden magic was never released; rather, it was lightly plucked out of the air and thrown away like a child handling a boring toy&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I presume this to be your answer. Very well. It is a very satisfactory reply. Let us fight fair and square.&rdquo; After saying that, Testarossa joined Ranga without turning around again. She left the place like nothing had happened.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster was in a state of panic but overcame it through sheer willpower. Torn between fear and humiliation, his humiliation eventually won. Normal soldiers didn&rsquo;t understand what had just transpired. Only Gaster and the sniper understood the events that unfolded before them. If that was the case, then he could use the tank guns, their strongest weapon, to mow them down like they had originally planned to do. That way, he could protect his pride as an Imperial soldier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lieutenant General Gaster, w-what should we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stay calm! Don&rsquo;t be fooled by their parlor tricks! We are the glorious Imperial Army. We will dedicate our victory to His Imperial Majesty! COMMENCE FIRING AS PLANNED!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In response to Gaster&rsquo;s booming command, tanks deployed on the left wing moved at once. The ultimatum that Testarossa delivered was simply ignored. The tank unit moved forward to make room between themselves and crossed the boundary line&mdash;the death marker.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

The Imperial Army unhesitatingly crossed the warning line that Testarossa had drawn. And that was the moment we entered a state of war with the Eastern Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see that it has started.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Everything has been set in motion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking rather arrogant, Ramiris and Veldora were engaged in conversation, slouched in slightly elevated chairs. I couldn&rsquo;t help but sigh. I had hoped that they were going to take this seriously and be more cautious. This wasn&rsquo;t a game; it&rsquo;s a real war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Enough of that, please evacuate the town immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris cheerfully responded to my request. &ldquo;Roger that! Just leave it to me&mdash;Ramiris-san!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Following that remark, the capital city Rimuru was teleported into the labyrinth without making a single sound. We had delayed the town&rsquo;s isolation until the very last minute because we had to act clueless in front of the enemy. And now, the charade was over. The minute they ignored Testarossa&rsquo;s warning, the gloves were off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After quickly finishing up separating the town, Ramiris blurted out like she just remembered, &ldquo;Oh right, Treyni-chan left a message.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, she said she felt a suspicious presence and decided to meet them in person.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure, either?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I should&rsquo;ve known better. Ramiris was the wrong person to ask for a detailed report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, she wasn&rsquo;t even my subordinate, so I had no reason to complain. I was already grateful for the fact that she was helping us and getting involved in the war when she had no obligations. Besides, it should be fine since it&rsquo;s Treyni-san&mdash;actually, now that I thought about it, she could be irresponsible at times too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Souei, what are we doing about these intruders?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was a little worried, so I wanted to double check with Souei.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is no problem. As previously discussed, we only have to focus on the large gate that appears aboveground.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seems like I&rsquo;m just overthinking things.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A sense of relief washed over me. Some spies had apparently infiltrated us, but they were being handled by Souei and his &ldquo;Dark Shadow&rdquo;, so I didn&rsquo;t have to stress over it that much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of which, let&rsquo;s talk about each floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The 91st to 95th floors were exchanged with the 96th to 100th floors. The entire town on the surface had been shoved to the bottom of the labyrinth&mdash;a temporary 101st floor. To get this far, you needed to defeat Veldora. And if that ever were to happen, common sense dictated that our defeat would&rsquo;ve been inevitable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The last line of defense was Floor 95. The 91st to 94th floors were the dragon rooms, and if you managed to get past them, you had Veldora waiting patiently for you at the end. Behind that was the Control Room, which we were currently occupying. If Veldora lost, then we were supposed to buy some time there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under those circumstances, we would return the town to the surface and have the inhabitants escape while Geld&rsquo;s troops protected them. To be frank, that was quite a reckless thing to pull off. Thus, I hoped that the Floor Guardians did their best here. At the very least, the labyrinth&rsquo;s defensive preparations were perfect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mean, normal armies couldn&rsquo;t break through the 95th floor even if they tried to. Naturally, all services in the labyrinth were halted because of the war. Stopping the sale of Resurrection Bracelets was a no-brainer, while inns and restrooms would be closed. In other words, our enemies were forced to prepare food and gather other resources by themselves. We also planned to shut off the water supply that was typically found on every 5th floor in order to increase the difficulty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you were serious about attempting to conquer the labyrinth, then you had to set aside days, if not months. Therefore, having a large army wasn&rsquo;t exactly better for them; rather, it was a hindrance. According to the information obtained from Gadra and others, the Empire&rsquo;s soldiers had been augmented. They could allegedly go a week without eating or drinking, but nonetheless, they should have trouble defeating the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I ran simulations with several Western Nation knights, and they had no chance of successfully conquering the labyrinth. Even if the Imperial Army was comparatively better, breaking through the labyrinth wouldn&rsquo;t be so easy. Perhaps I was worrying a bit too much, but well, you could never be too careful. There was also the possibility that they would ignore and bypass the labyrinth, so we had no other choice but to wait and see what moves the enemy took.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, everything was ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Empire&rsquo;s movements had already been notified to neighboring nations, so they were most likely praying for our victory right now. The Western Reserve Force was on standby to prepare for a worst-case scenario, so I hoped they could handle the rest as the situation demanded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, I focused again on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa rejoined Gobta and left the field riding on Ranga&rsquo;s back. The imperial tank unit was deployed like they were going to chase after them. The tank guns were moving, which gave the impression that they were about to fire at them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is this going to be okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be dangerous if they land a hit, but there&rsquo;s no need to fret,&rdquo; Benimaru replied fearlessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Benimaru gave the First and the Third Corps orders by using his Unique Skill &lsquo;Generalissimo&rsquo;. The Tempest forces acted all at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Green Numbers began their cautious advance toward the enemy&rsquo;s rear. They had entered the forest and utilized the trees as cover, paying close attention in avoiding enemy detection. If they believed they could win, they would attack; if they felt the enemy was dangerous, they would withdraw&mdash;I guess they didn&rsquo;t intend to make any rash decisions before finding that out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of the aerial cavalry unit that Gabil led, 100 Hiryuu and 300 Wyvern Riders from the Blue Numbers instantly took to the skies. They intended to launch an aerial assault on the slow-moving tanks. While I believed it was a good decision, the enemy also had units with flight capabilities. Once those appeared, then it was going to be a heated battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Last but not least was Gobta&rsquo;s crew, the group closest to the enemy forces. Given how the power of the tank gun was unknown, staying within its range would be suicide. There was still a lot of distance between the two armies before they made contact, but since the enemy&rsquo;s effective range was unknown, vigilance was necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, it didn&rsquo;t seem like the Goblin Riders had been spotted yet; I believe they intended on attacking the tank guns. Maybe there were new weapons that even Gadra didn&rsquo;t know about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Report. Based on calculations from the orientation and angle of the tank guns, their aim is accurate. It appears they know the exact position of the Goblin Riders hiding in the trees.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">EHHH?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s really bad news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru, it looks like the enemy is somehow locating Gobta and his group!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood. I thought that might be a possibility, which is why I told Gobta and the other Goblin Riders to act as the vanguard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was the only one panicking, whereas Benimaru&rsquo;s calm attitude stood firm. Apparently, this turn of events was within his expectations. I decided to trust Benimaru and wait to see what happened next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were 2,000 tanks in total; 500 of them had rotated around, wary of Gobta and his group. Moreover, the 20 frontmost tanks were about to fire their main gun. There was a striking difference between these tanks and the ones from my original world&mdash;didn&rsquo;t these tanks have shorter barrels?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Encountering areas with dense thickets while passing through the foothills of a mountain range was unavoidable. However, that scenario in particular posed no problem for the tanks since their short barrels allowed them a greater range of maneuverability. Either way, it seemed that they were also content with knocking down trees through brute force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, the fact that it was easy to turn made it convenient for them to maintain a tight formation. They could also make brisk turns without being obstructed by each other&rsquo;s barrels. It was unclear whether or not the barrel&rsquo;s length retained accuracy and range, but that was a question for another day. They&rsquo;d probably solved such an issue given how they were using these tanks in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as for Gobta and the Goblin Riders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta had already reunited with his unit. His face was pale, but it wasn&rsquo;t because he was scared of the tanks&mdash;perhaps it was the realization about Testarossa&rsquo;s true nature, and the fact that he was in a very dangerous predicament.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa sat sideways on Ranga&rsquo;s back and gracefully brushed her hair. Now that the negotiations were over, she thought she had done her part. Well, to be honest, her actions were laudable since she returned safely. I didn&rsquo;t mind if she rested for a bit, but now was not the right time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was pondering that, the tanks finally fired, and 21 shells came flying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">It was hard to tell from just observing through Argos, but the one shot that left the command vehicle looked different from the others. </span><span class="c2">What is that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Gobta, &ldquo;Shadow Hide&rdquo;!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone, Shadow Hide!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s order was swift, leaving my doubts behind in the dust. Gobta instantly acknowledged it. Without a moment&rsquo;s pause, the Goblin Riders disappeared with &lsquo;Shadow Step&rsquo;. What followed immediately after was a shower of shells.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A rain composed of 21 destructive shots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a hell too horrible to fathom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. Since the caliber of the tank gun is 120mm, the mass of the shell is estimated to be approximately 21 kilograms. Based on the distance to the point of impact and elapsed travel time, the calculated speed is found to be less than six times the speed of sound. Kinetic energy is proportional to the product of mass of the shell and its velocity squared. From these conditions, the muzzle energy and penetration capability can be determined. The decrease in speed is inversely proportional to the transverse load, and air resistance has also been taken into account by simulating the surrounding environment. These values are then multiplied by the magical power coefficient hidden in the shell. If the computed value was converted in terms of TNT, it would be&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You know, I&rsquo;m really sorry to say this when you seem so happy explaining everything, but&hellip;uh, I don&rsquo;t know how strong TNT is anyway, so even if you converted it, I still wouldn&rsquo;t know&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;&hellip;Understood. Then, in practical terms, if the main gate of the Dwarven Kingdom sustained a direct hit, it would be destroyed. Even an A ranked dragon cannot withstand it. Anyone within five meters of the point of impact will suffer significant injuries, and those under C rank caught in the blast have no chance of surviving.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now that&rsquo;s more like it. You should&rsquo;ve explained it this way from the start&mdash;wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was pretty disturbing. Furthermore, given how there was apparently a mysterious shell mixed in with the barrage, I began to truly worry for Gobta&rsquo;s safety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, my concerns turned out to be unfounded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The ground exploded as soon as the shells landed. It continued 20 times in a row, completely changing the terrain. When the last shot finally hit, a fire engulfed the location where Gobta and his group had been located. A gust of wind and a small storm shredded the surrounding area. The damage extended to several dozen meters, demonstrating the monstrosity of its power. That was most likely the mysterious shell&rsquo;s effect. </span><span class="c2">How dare they develop a shell as dangerous as nuclear magic?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was knowledge of the fact that Gobta&rsquo;s group was safe that enabled me to make a comment like that. They had responded to Benimaru&rsquo;s order in the blink of an eye and used &lsquo;Shadow Step&rsquo; to retreat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I&rsquo;m glad everyone is all right.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;No, we aren&rsquo;t! A shock wave has even managed to penetrate the shadow space!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Did someone get hurt?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&lsaquo;No, no one&rsquo;s injured. Thanks to Benimaru-san, we&rsquo;re all safe.&rsaquo; Gobta replied happily. He complained about it being painful, but at least he sounded fine. </span><span class="c2">By the way, I wonder if Testarossa could do &lsquo;Shadow Step&rsquo;&mdash;never mind, she seemed okay, so there&rsquo;s no use worrying about her.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;More importantly, the issue at hand right now was debating our next move.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

This allowed for meaningful conversations even in a short period of time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;So, what should we do next?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wanted to hear Benimaru&rsquo;s opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;As of right now, Gabil&rsquo;s unit is heading to launch an assault on the enemy tank unit. I want Gobta and others to intercept the enemy and perform a pincer attack.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hoh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be dangerous?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yes, it&rsquo;ll be dangerous, but Gabil&rsquo;s team will create a diversion, and Gobta and his group will then seize that opportunity to attack. The tanks&rsquo; destructive power is beyond expectations, but not their mobility. They have a good chance of winning.&rsaquo; Benimaru declared proudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After examining the offensive and defensive capabilities from what happened just now, we determined that the flight speed of Gabil&rsquo;s team was faster than the turning speed of the tank guns. This meant that Gabil&rsquo;s unit, which was all about evasion, theoretically shouldn&rsquo;t be hit by the tank&rsquo;s gun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Benimaru claimed that getting struck was next to impossible, I&rsquo;d say charging straight at the enemy was the scariest part. On the other hand, Gabil was brave and looked as though he didn&rsquo;t seem to care about that at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess as long as you were flying, you wouldn&rsquo;t be hurt because you could avoid the enemy&rsquo;s line of fire. As for Gabil, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll get through it with his enthusiasm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next, regarding Gobta and his men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;A-are we going to charge in as well?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&lsaquo;You guys are the stars of the show, but don&rsquo;t worry. Once you&rsquo;ve slipped into their lines, they&rsquo;ll move slower due to fear of friendly fire. So, once Gabil&rsquo;s team begins their diversion, run through them as fast as you can!&rsaquo; Benimaru mercilessly ordered Gobta like an oni. </span><span class="c2">Well, he </span><span class="c7">is</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;an oni, after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Um, we&rsquo;ll do so while we&rsquo;re still in &lsquo;Shadow Step&rsquo;, right?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru shook his head at Gobta&rsquo;s question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s dangerous. I expect the enemies to have a variety of defensive measures prepared, including monster detection and defense barriers. They&rsquo;ll also probably have countermeasures against Skills, so it&rsquo;s better to avoid an obvious tactic like that.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I agreed on this part as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their treasured tanks definitely had an exhaustive defense system in place because there was no way they would leave them unprotected. There were also barriers against Skills, and it&rsquo;d be bad news if they had one installed. It might be safer instead to attack them head on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;There is something called interfacial barriers in legion magic. It is a magic that prevents surprise attacks from a different space, but by that same principle, it can also be used to trap us and restrict our movements. As Benimaru-dono noted, a frontal assault may be the safest option.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa did a good job summarizing what I wanted to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Gobta appeared like he understood everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;G-got it. I-if T-Testarossa-sa-n says so, I have no complaints.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gobta seems scared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I mean, he did spew some pretty offensive stuff right to an overwhelmingly higher being&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No wonder he was deathly afraid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was anticipating&mdash; No, looking forward to&mdash; No, not that either&hellip; Right, I&rsquo;d been waiting for the right moment to quietly follow up on this particular matter. Therefore, I decided to give Gobta a little piece of advice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Gobta-kun. You shouldn&rsquo;t judge people by their appearances. Keep that in mind again and don&rsquo;t make the same mistakes again!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although, this also applied to me as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After all, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been aware of the truth of the three demon ladies had I not been explicitly informed about it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;ll give it some thought&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yep, yep. That&rsquo;s good!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;May I ask what you are talking about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a secret by any means; it&rsquo;s about Gobta&rsquo;s misunderstanding.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahh, with Testarossa? That guy has certainly grown, but he lacks the crucial takeaways. It&rsquo;s better if he learns from his mistakes through experience from time to time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru seemed to have also noticed and smiled wryly at my explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speaking of which, who were those people that Diablo brought here with him? Especially the three ladies, I felt something unusual from them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had approved of them, and so Benimaru accepted them without a word. However, as expected, he was apparently concerned about their identities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But you see&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t want to reveal the fact that they were very dangerous demons called primordials&mdash;ignorance would indeed be bliss in this case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That said, I didn&rsquo;t think I could keep it a secret forever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt sorry about being unforthcoming to even my own executives. While Shion neither knew nor cared, it might&rsquo;ve been a good idea if I told Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Regarding that, I&rsquo;ll tell you some other time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru shrugged in response to my answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that is fair. This isn&rsquo;t a topic we should be focusing on in the midst of a war.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looked like he was convinced, and so I also decided to change gears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;So Gobta, it is wartime right now. Reflection is important, but do that after you come back alive.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Of course!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Do you have any questions about the plan&rsquo;s outline?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Nothin&rsquo;, Benimaru-san. We will move to the edge of the forest and rush in when Gabil-san starts the attack.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Good. Get excited!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yeah!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta was no longer scared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, he could concentrate on the plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, I ended the &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; meeting.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a few minutes&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Third Corps, led by Gabil, assaulted the tank unit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gah-ha-ha-ha! Behold my genius! Clumsy people like you guys are no match against us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As usual, Gabil was excessively enthusiastic and struck an overly dramatic pose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This made me worried, but I suppose he was simply being himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, the tanks were unable to respond immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like what Benimaru predicted, the movement of the tank guns couldn&rsquo;t keep up with Gabil&rsquo;s team.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil deserved a lot of credit. With his excellent command, everyone&rsquo;s coordination was perfect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was likely the result of substantial training. They seemed to have acquired remarkable combat aerial capabilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While the 100 Hiryuu was a given, the 300 Wyvern Riders were also performing brilliantly. I heard there were reserve riders trained, so if the number of wyverns increased, they would become a reliable force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s primary purpose was to act as a diversion, but it wasn&rsquo;t as though he didn&rsquo;t attack at all. He also let the wyverns spit fireballs as another distraction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As monsters equivalent to B-plus rank, their fireball was naturally as powerful as the elemental magic &lsquo;Fireball&rsquo; of an average magician.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t enough to break through the tanks&rsquo; magical defenses, but it was still effective against foot soldiers. This demonstrated Gabil&rsquo;s true worth: air-to-surface attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a minor achievement in terms of military prowess, but they fulfilled their tactical role excellently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next, we had Gobta&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He apparently had a complete change of heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no hesitation in Gobta&rsquo;s command now, and they immediately charged at the tank unit with perfect coordination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beyond the 500 tanks currently facing Gobta&rsquo;s team were the 1,500 tanks facing the Dwarven Kingdom. If they managed to infiltrate that far, then the enemy wouldn&rsquo;t be able to act carelessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;d be a major victory if they could get there, but the Imperial Army wasn&rsquo;t incompetent. They would try their best to block Gobta&rsquo;s advance; in other words, it was a battle of proficiency and speed from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta seemed to understand this and, while following Benimaru&rsquo;s instructions, used their thunderous speed to run through the tank unit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They didn&rsquo;t even look at the muzzle that was pointed at them and showed no signs of fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">About a hundred meters remained until they reached the front row of the tanks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Goblin Riders could run the distance in less than six seconds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Several shots rang out, but Gobta and his group weren&rsquo;t frightened. They didn&rsquo;t slow down and kept running.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In truth, the bombardment looked like it was for intimidation purposes given how the shells exploded in the wrong direction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was evidence that the Imperial Army was shaken up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Goblin Riders moved with elegant efficiency and thoroughly eliminated obstacles that blocked their path.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even now, the infantry that were guarding the tanks tried to block the way, but instead became prey to the wolves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The distance was now zero.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, they succeeded in approaching the tank unit, their primary goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ranga was running in the front with Gobta straddling him. They were a magnificent sight to behold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta signaled Gobchi with his eyes, who was in the second position. Gobchi nodded in response. The next moment, Gobchi was the only one that headed for a tank turret and threw a small &ldquo;something&rdquo; inside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That &ldquo;something&rdquo; was a glowing red jewel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a Spirit Core&mdash;otherwise known as a Core.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kurobee had prepared a huge number of empty Cores, and I asked Charys to imbue them with fire mana.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One might think they were being prepared for magic swords, but instead, they saw better usage as a substitute bomb.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I called it the Flare Bomb.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question now was whether or not it would actually work&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An incendiary explosion would occur inside the tank, which was their one weakness. If this didn&rsquo;t work, then we were going to stop the operation immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Will it be all right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru, there&rsquo;s no need to worry. Believe in my friend Charys!&rdquo; Veldora boomed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rest assured, Rimuru-sama. Given how they are imbued with mana to the point that they are ready to explode, I am confident that they can easily render those lump of irons inoperable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also thought it was okay, but this was a preliminary experiment. And as if to tell me not to worry, the tank exploded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;See? Just like I said, right? My plan is perfect!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was entirely my idea, which was why I&rsquo;d been extra worried&hellip; But since it succeeded, I couldn&rsquo;t help but want to brag.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You sure changed your tune quick&hellip;&rdquo; Veldora observed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so like him!&rdquo; Ramiris agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speak for yourselves!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We shouted at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Charys looked proud; Benimaru and Beretta smiled bitterly, whereas Shion and Diablo both grinned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The success of the second phase of the operation created a slightly brighter atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been the prelude up until now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next step was to sneak into the inner part of their formation. Gobta&rsquo;s team hit the center while ignoring the foot soldiers poised to stop them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They ran while hitting the infantry units that&rsquo;d been placed to protect the turret&rsquo;s blind spots&mdash;like a giant monster running about on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The movement was projected on a large screen, showing off its polished beauty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gobta sure did it. They won&rsquo;t be targeted by tank guns at this rate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t let our guard down. Depending on the enemy commander, they might ignore the damage to their own comrades and continue attacking us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought that would be foolish, but this was war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We had to assume that was a possibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Besides, they also have airpower. It&rsquo;s still too early to relax.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He&rsquo;s right</span><span class="c1">&mdash;I thought to myself and turned my eyes to another big screen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking at the sight of flying objects projected on there, I could see that their speed had increased. The Empire also seemed to be coordinating by some means.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When the enemy&rsquo;s air force arrived, Gabil would have to deal with them. And when that happened, Gobta&rsquo;s group would end up isolated on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that was the case, then it was a race against time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wanted to achieve a decisive victory while we still could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Progress on the battlefield continued to advance smoothly and up to my expectations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta and Gabil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two maximized the results of their training and had been successful in their first real battle. However, nothing ever works out perfectly forever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like Benimaru said, it was too early to relax&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Refusing to admit it, Gaster decided to regain his confidence by tearing Gobta and his group to pieces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster thought that it was impossible for the monsters, who could only disrupt their deployment, to damage the tanks, regardless of how quickly they moved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, that preconception was shattered with the roar of an explosion on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You can&rsquo;t be serious?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster wanted to shout, but stopped himself just in time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A commander could never, ever be visibly upset on the battlefield. Gaster was still a brilliant man, and he hadn&rsquo;t lost his wits yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lieutenant General, what should we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic. Take a closer look at the enemy&rsquo;s movements. They&rsquo;ve only destroyed a single tank and show no signs of following up. This is proof that the bomb is one of the few trump cards they possess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. In my opinion, you&rsquo;re right. Otherwise, the lizards flying in the sky would&rsquo;ve scattered them too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Exactly,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Gaster nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He thought he had made a calm and reasonable assumption, but it couldn&rsquo;t have been further from the truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In reality, Rimuru had prepared a total of 3,000 flare bombs. Gobta and the rest of the Goblin Riders each had ten, and the flying lizards&mdash;Gabil and his Hiryuu&mdash;also had ten per person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil and his unit didn&rsquo;t bother using the flare bombs because they were concentrating on acting as a diversion. They also knew that flare bombs wouldn&rsquo;t reach their full potential unless they were employed in an enclosed area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gunpowder was twice as powerful when detonated in a confined space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same logic applied to flare bombs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s primary focus was the destruction of the tanks, not the soldiers around them. As a result, he forbade everyone from wasting their flare bombs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The important thing was the success or failure of the operation, not the immediate achievement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta, Gabil, and the monsters under their command all understood this very well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster, who didn&rsquo;t know that, regained his composure by giving himself a little pep talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I commend you for unleashing your new weapon without hesitation. However, we&rsquo;re the ones who will win!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster misread Gobta and the others&rsquo; trump card, but he knew precisely what their goal was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The reason why you ignored the left-wing battalion is to crush this one, right? If so, then we have more than enough options!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil and his groups&rsquo; attacks were flashy, yet they were rendered ineffective by a magical barrier. The only thing to be wary of was the new weapon, so then it boiled down to keeping Gobta&rsquo;s unit away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s use a concentrated air battle formation to deal with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The adjutant was surprised at Gaster&rsquo;s orders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lieutenant General, that&rsquo;s dangerous! Now that some of our men are interspersed with enemy forces, shouldn&rsquo;t we be worried about potential friendly fire?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What does that have to do with anything? If they are in the way, why wouldn&rsquo;t we simply blow them up with our tank guns? Moreover, the glorious Imperial Army has no need for incompetent fools who drag down their allies in the first place!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wha&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With such a declaration, the adjutant could no longer stop Gaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few tanks and a large number of infantry would be lost, but they would definitely win the battle&mdash;and the adjutant knew this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To win a battle by sacrificing a few without a second thought&mdash;a commander required that type of vision and determination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is there an issue with the legality of my decision?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No sir. There is nothing wrong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The military staff agreed with Gaster&rsquo;s judgement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, Gaster began his solo recital.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Left wing battalion, take a concentrated air battle formation!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By using his Skill, Gaster gave the order directly without going through his subordinates. This allowed the left-wing battalion to form up faster than ever before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ignoring those who were already overtaken by Gobta and others, the remaining vehicles blocked the road and rotated their tank guns. Then, other tanks quickly joined the formation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a formation that defied even the common sense of modern warfare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?! What kind of nonsense&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was no surprise that Gobta was stunned and shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tanks took advantage of their giant stature and squeezed together like they were trying to eliminate any gaps. With that, however, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to move. Still, it was effective as this made it impossible for Gobta and his men to escape through the cracks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nevertheless, it was still too early to be surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The left-wing battalion spread out in a circle and formed a barricade around Gobta and the Goblin Riders. In response to the barricade, half of the center main force also began to move. They floated into the air, turned around, and landed on the backs of the tanks in the frontmost row. They became a wall that blocked Gobta&rsquo;s path.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nearly a thousand tanks were linked together and turned into one huge fortress. This completely prevented Gobta&rsquo;s team from destroying the central unit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that they were capable of that kind of movement, but I never would&rsquo;ve thought they could pull something like that off&hellip;&rdquo; Gobchi muttered, who was Gobta&rsquo;s adjutant, clearly shocked by the scene that unfolded before him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Stop the enemy&rsquo;s movement with a barrage from the machine guns!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What followed was a three-dimensional machine gun sweep. The multifaceted barrage prevented the high-speed maneuvering that Gobta and his friends excelled at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta and his men were surrounded by tanks and troops that accompanied them, but that didn&rsquo;t matter at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is bad. At this rate, we won&rsquo;t be able to carry out the operation!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta became upset when Benimaru&rsquo;s strategy fell apart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing the Imperial soldiers being shot by their allies, Gobta was understandably growing impatient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Grrr&hellip; Sorry, Gobta. I want to help you, but our hands are tied&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s team was under heavy fire in the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if the tank&rsquo;s cannon couldn&rsquo;t hit them, they were still equipped with machine guns. That was why Gabil and his men were being kept away.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that commander Gaster regained his composure, the difference in numbers became a decisive advantage. And bad things always came in twos.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Sorry for the wait, Gaster-dono!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Air Assault Division, led by Major General Farage, had appeared with a hundred airships.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s group would be forced to deal with them, which put Gobta and his men in an increasingly difficult position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ah, Farage, you&rsquo;ve finally arrived. So, I guess this means checkmate. This is the perfect stage for a test run of the top-secret weapon &lsquo;magic canceler&rsquo;, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Haha, I can&rsquo;t compete against you, Gaster-dono. Without a moment&rsquo;s delay, we will also now join the battle.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I&rsquo;ll share the credit with you. Don&rsquo;t make any mistakes, okay?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Understood. Then, best of luck!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By using a special line of communication, Gaster and Farage agreed to work together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Gaster, this was to make the strategy rock solid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Farage, the purpose was to warm up before the main show, and to demonstrate that they could be useful in actual battles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Air Assault Division had a precious weapon called an airship, but their position was the lowest among the three divisions. Thus, it was necessary to prove their worth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the participation of Farage and his airships, the situation became even more disadvantageous for Tempest&rsquo;s forces.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Gobta&rsquo;s unit, the affected party, who best understood the change in the current state of affairs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Commander Gobta, what should we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t lookin&rsquo; good. Let&rsquo;s pull back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Good choice. Since the tides have turned, we don&rsquo;t have to push our luck.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta had made the correct decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Do not try to force a mission to succeed, and withdraw in the event of an unforeseen situation&rsquo;&mdash;this was a rule that&rsquo;d been thoroughly taught.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru, who had been watching the entire time, gave the order to retreat, which made them fully realize the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone turned around without missing a beat and fell back at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, they tried to use &lsquo;Shadow Step&rsquo; to escape&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gobta, our enemy is not incompetent. It appears they&rsquo;ve sabotaged us with magic so that we can&rsquo;t use &lsquo;Shadow Step&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time Ranga warned Gobta about the anomaly he sensed, it was too late. They were already under the influence of the Empire&rsquo;s widespread magic obstruction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nobody besides Ranga could break through the trap. Therefore, the only option was to physically run away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone! Run to the forest as fast as possible!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta&rsquo;s facial expression changed as he shouted, and the Goblin Riders obeyed his orders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were less than two hundred meters away from the forest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, it would&rsquo;ve only taken a few seconds to reach. However, since they were being shot at from behind, it now felt like an excruciating eternity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The retreat was going to be fraught with hardship&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster smiled cruelly as he watched Gobta&rsquo;s group flee. He quickly ordered his subordinates to prepare the tank guns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You bastards, don&rsquo;t go thinking that you&rsquo;ll have an easy getaway!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He planned on using his last special shell. Following Gaster&rsquo;s command, the round was quickly loaded and immediately fired. The special shell landed in the forest in front of Gobta&rsquo;s unit and exploded, scattering fire everywhere. The goal was to block their path. Gobta and his men used their heightened intuition to evade the incoming shell, but they couldn&rsquo;t do anything if the forest they were trying to escape to was burning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, this is bad&hellip; I wonder if we can make it back alive?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gobta-san, please don&rsquo;t joke around like that. Well, since I&rsquo;m here, everyone will return safely!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gobto, when I listen to your overly confident and baseless remark, it makes me feel stupid for having been so worried.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even Captain Gobta&mdash;no, I mean Corps Commander Gobta&mdash;has worries?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That much is obvious. At best, he&rsquo;d be wondering about tonight&rsquo;s dinner menu. Or, about how he&rsquo;s gonna apologize to Rigur-san, who discovered that he went out with His Majesty Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobchi and Gobte both added their two cents, and the Goblin Riders laughed. The situation was hopeless, yet Gobta and the others hadn&rsquo;t lost their usual liveliness. And this conversation between Gobta and his men was overheard by Gaster, who was listening in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You inferior fools. Now that the enclosure is complete, your fate is in the palm of my hands!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster&rsquo;s heart was brimming with burning rage. His gaze was set on a beautiful woman with pure white hair&mdash;Testarossa. She was exposed to the explosive heat, but her composure was as cool as a cucumber. She also didn&rsquo;t seem to consider the flying rounds to be a threat at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You too. You ridiculed me here, and I&rsquo;ll never forgive you! I&rsquo;ll turn your beautiful face into a blubbering mess filled with fear!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster was unaware of his dark desires. He was charmed by Testarossa and didn&rsquo;t even realize that his own judgement had become too extreme. His face twisted into a wicked expression, and Gaster commanded, &lsaquo;Attention, all remaining vehicles! Fire your cannons at the enemy!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The remaining forces of the left wing were busy attracting Gobta and the others. Although the order ignored their safety, no one disagreed. The remaining thousand tanks rotated their turrets as the barricade of tanks restrained the movement of Gobta&rsquo;s unit. Adjusting the angle and providing anti-shock protection as a measure to shoot from point-blank range&mdash;the deadly muzzle that reaps life was about to fire all at once.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

A number of powerful magic was fired from the airships.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the face of this, Gabil and his men were at a distinct disadvantage. The problem was that the movement of magicules was being disrupted. Their top-secret weapon, the magic canceler, was affecting not only Gobta&rsquo;s unit, but Gabil&rsquo;s as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Grrr, what a pain in the ass. As soon as we get near those airships, our bodies get heavier and heavier.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What should we do, Gabil-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to help Gobta and others, but we can&rsquo;t at the moment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While the Hiryuu could handle it by themselves, they still had to look after the Wyvern Riders, who had little to no combat experience. If anything went wrong here, both Gobta and Gabil&rsquo;s unit could be destroyed together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Argh, we don&rsquo;t have a choice! We have to take out those airships first. We have the numerical advantage. Everyone, focus on the enemy in front of you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood, General!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But the enemy is bigger than us, aren&rsquo;t they? Even if we compare numbers&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up, idiot! Even Gabil-sama has realized it, but he&rsquo;s got no other choice but to give such an order!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was someone who killed the mood, but that was the norm. Contrary to the conversation, Gabil and his men were committed to battling the flying fleet.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A person stared at Gabil&rsquo;s group with ruthless eyes. The leader of the jewel of the Armored Corps, Air Assault Division&mdash;Major General Farage. He was a talented man with comparable ambitions. His desire to further his military career was not unique among the other officers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nonetheless, Farage thoroughly flattered other colleagues since he was eager not to earn their ire. There was an explanation behind this, of course. He had experienced how his old home, the Magic Corps, had ended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Magic Corps was once a force to be reckoned with, yet it was now a dismantled relic of the past. It might be due to a trend of the times, but the main reason was that they were determined to be inefficient in warfare. Magical fights were often thought of as flashy, when in reality it was a very modest task. All the magicians had to do was analyze and interfere with the enemy&rsquo;s magic. At that time, they had to activate their own magic and hit their opponent&rsquo;s army. This was repeated over and over again, and did not produce any significant results. This was because knights reinforced by magic were much stronger than sorcerers when it came down to actual combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, nuclear magic has been touted as the most powerful type of magic, yet it required more than a dozen magicians to execute. It wasn&rsquo;t something an individual could use, and constructing and casting the spell took up precious time. There were exceptions, such as heroes who could wield nuclear magic by themselves&hellip; Nevertheless, the resulting explosion only had a diameter of a hundred meters at best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In essence, a mage could not be expected to play an active role on the battlefield. Furthermore, although having additional magicians was advantageous, more did not always translate to better. This was due to the fact that magicules floating around the battlefield was finite, and once it was all expended, magicians became useless. Mages were an indispensable existence, but they were unarguably a mediocre existence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage was also a brilliant wizard and one of Master Gadra&rsquo;s students. He respected his master, Gadra, valued his teachings, and never neglected his own diligence. However, he realized something. As the Armored Corps became modernized with the help of Master Gadra, the Magic Corps found fewer and fewer opportunities to play an active role.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This era no longer required well-trained magicians. With the advent of spell guns, even ordinary humans could manipulate magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage hated Gadra. He asserted that his master&rsquo;s actions were strangling them. Yet, Gadra promptly rejected his concerns. As a result, the Magic Corps continually declined&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why I betrayed my teacher and swore allegiance to Calgurio-sama.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that was how he obtained his current position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He accepted his former subordinates, who were all talented magicians, and gave them active roles to play. He wanted the Air Assault Division to one day become the strongest. Until that happened, Farage thought to make sure his colleagues were in a good mood and kept a low profile for himself. He had always been a self-disciplined person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then finally, the perfect opportunity appeared: Operation Subjugate Veldora. And, at the heart of it all stood the Air Assault Division. The essence of the mission was to contain Veldora using the magic canceler. Besides that, they would also assist other troops.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their original role was to provide logistical support, but they were excused from that job this time. In fact, 300 of the 400 airships were on different missions, and the remaining 100 were filled to the brim with elite magicians.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a configuration centered solely on combat, which demonstrated how crucial the operation&rsquo;s success was to Calgurio. Farage was well aware of the fact that this mission needed to be carried out at all costs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is where we will distinguish ourselves and prove our usefulness. A new era is about to begin!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage chuckled to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if that was the case, there was no need to take heed of the other officers&rsquo; feelings anymore. With their positions reversed, no one would be able to ignore Farage&rsquo;s wishes. He had no doubt that this was his destiny.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those flying lizards and crawling dogs aren&rsquo;t nearly enough of a warmup before defeating Veldora, but that&rsquo;s fine,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Farage pondered.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll simply use them as practice for our new weapon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you want to share the credit for? I&rsquo;m the one who owes you a favor, Gaster-dono!&rdquo; Farage shouted loudly while holding a glass of wine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone! We&rsquo;ve been patiently enduring everything up until this point, but that ends today! Let&rsquo;s show them our true power!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;Yeaaah!!&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo; the crew members shouted enthusiastically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although they were originally elite magicians, they couldn&rsquo;t bear the reality of experiencing hardships. The humiliation they suffered would be wiped away by the glory days that began now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone felt the same way. With that common belief running through their mind, the one hundred airships strengthened their efforts&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The biggest feature of the airship was the magic canceler generator, but it was also equipped with state-of-the-art weaponry. It was controlled by mages versed in elemental and summoning magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The makeup of the airship was roughly divided into three departments: the operations, defense, and offensive. A hundred men were assigned to each of them, and the remaining hundred were held in reserve, where they worked on communication and medical affairs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Needless to say, the operations department operated the airship. A minimum of fifty people were required to fly the ship, but even a hundred personnel was insufficient if they wanted to operate the craft at full strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The defense department was in charge of the airship&rsquo;s &lsquo;Defense Barrier&rsquo; and dealt with a variety of attacks such as anti-physics, anti-magic, and anti-element. The hull of the ship was kept thin in order to save weight. If they neglected to defend the airship with reinforcement magic, then they could easily be shot down. They were a critical department.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Last was the offensive department, the star of the show. One of the weapons installed on the airship was the magic-amplified cannon, and this also served to facilitate cooperation between magicians. Multiple magicians could supply the mana orb on the pedestal with their mana at the same time. By chanting magic simultaneously, they could control powerful magic rather easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a total of five magic-amplified cannons, one located in the front and two on either side of the ship, which required a maximum number of ten mages per gun. Substitute magicians were located in seats behind so that the cannon could be fired continuously. It was worth nothing that the power of the cannon increased in proportion to the number of users. For instance, if two people powered it, then it was four times stronger. Thus, if ten mages operated it consecutively, then the output would increase by a factor of 20.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a menace. Even a simple fireball would become more powerful than a large magic fireball. It went without saying how much potential this possessed.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The airship&rsquo;s defenses were flawless. The wyverns&rsquo; fireballs were like spitballs, and the barrier even prevented physical attacks. Half-baked attacks didn&rsquo;t work and that satisfied Farage. Furthermore, its offensive capabilities&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Airships are the strongest of them all. It&rsquo;s time to show your true potential. Swat those unsightly lizards out of the sky with maximum power!&rdquo; Farage passionately appealed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So far, only two or three mages had been chanting magic. But the time for tests was over. The real show was about to begin. The magic-amplified cannon was activated by channeling mana into a spell control jewel. The jewel was about 50 centimeters in diameter and made of high-purity magic stone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The magicians who had been standing idly by now held out their hands and, with the combined might of ten people, unleashed large-scale magic. Lightning, ice, snow, flames, vacuum blades, and other terrifying magic blasted into the sky with a tremendous power 20 times greater than normal.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Faced with overwhelming and extensive magic, Gabil&rsquo;s men went down one after another. The battle intensified and injuries began to appear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, I always knew that there were going to be injuries. I knew it, yet I couldn&rsquo;t help but be optimistic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d once said, &ldquo;We will win no matter what!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was brimming with confidence, and even Raphael-san had no objections, so I naively believed that we wouldn&rsquo;t run into any issues. However, reality was often different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course it is. Because this is war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was impossible to win without sustaining at least some damage to our side. I felt angry and impatient at my own rose-colored naivety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please sit down, Rimuru-sama. This is expected and there is nothing wrong,&rdquo; Benimaru told me with a calm expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something about his words hit a nerve in me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You sure created a lot of casualties! That&rsquo;s why I should&rsquo;ve used Megiddo to back you up&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;No, we&rsquo;d already decided against that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Megiddo was certainly effective, we came to the conclusion that it was still unusable. Benimaru also questioned its effectiveness, and even Diablo was against it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were a few reasons. First of all, since we&rsquo;d decided to move forward as a nation, we couldn&rsquo;t keep relying on our demon lord&mdash;in other words, me&mdash;forever. Benimaru asserted that the demon lord was responsible for protecting monsters under his rule, and on the flip side, it was the subordinates&rsquo; duty to protect the country. The other executives also agreed that if they wanted to recognize Tempest as their own country, yet were unwilling to protect it, then they had no right to live here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama doesn&rsquo;t have to shoulder everything alone,&rdquo; Shuna reminded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I heard that, I felt happy and agreed with her sentiment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the first reason. The second reason was Megiddo&rsquo;s weaknesses that Diablo pointed out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This Megiddo is very beautiful magic; it has a low cost but high output power, and it is versatile while remaining easy to use. However, once you know of its existence, you can take measures to protect yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was Diablo&rsquo;s argument. We could activate it while we were in the Control Room, and it definitely would&rsquo;ve been useful this time around too. Nevertheless, if our secret was revealed, then it wouldn&rsquo;t work next time. As Hinata had pointed out, if someone blew up a big dust cloud, that alone would reduce the accuracy and power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that Diablo was able to get Hinata&rsquo;s opinion demonstrated his frightening ability at information gathering, but let&rsquo;s put that aside for later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The last time Megiddo was used, everyone was killed. Except for Edmalis and Razen&mdash;they were the only two survivors. Still, they had a gag order, so there was no real danger of information being leaked. But circumstances were different this time. There was no way we could keep hundreds of thousands of Imperial soldiers in the dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We should also hold onto a trump card,&rdquo; Benimaru had advised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo and Benimaru&rsquo;s opinion was that we shouldn&rsquo;t carelessly use such tremendous and stunning magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their explanation convinced me. Megiddo was a super-heated ray made of sunlight and it was almost impossible to avoid by sight. As an anti-personnel magic, it only shone when used under the right situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, our opponents weren&rsquo;t living beings, but rather iron tanks. That wasn&rsquo;t to say Megiddo wouldn&rsquo;t work, but it&rsquo;d undoubtedly be illogical. Raphael-san had also determined that destroying a tank would take an impractical amount of time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unless the power was increased&mdash;that is, the focal temperature of the heat ray was focused to tens of thousands of degrees or more&mdash;the tank couldn&rsquo;t be penetrated. Also, since none of the tanks ran on oil, they wouldn&rsquo;t explode and burn like one would typically expect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If tanks couldn&rsquo;t be stopped just by penetrating it with a single heat ray, then it had to be continually hit until it was full of holes and broke down. At that point, it&rsquo;d be easier to blow it up with nuclear magic than to do such a repetitive task.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that case, we needed to break through multiple layers of anti-magic barriers, and the magician who casted it would have to be dealt with first, which eventually led to a drawn-out magic battle&hellip;which made it tactically meaningless. It would&rsquo;ve never worked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, other than giving Benimaru the right to command, all I had to do was to watch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I should join the war as well&mdash;&rdquo; I mumbled, but was immediately interrupted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s forbidden. As the overall commander, I cannot allow the king to be exposed to danger. More importantly, there was something in the story that the Hero Chloe shared that interested me. In the other timeline, somebody had murdered Rimuru-sama. Armed with the knowledge that such a threatening person exists, it is impossible to ask Rimuru-sama to fight on the battlefield.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All the executives knew that there was a dangerous person on the enemies&rsquo; side because I had shared the story and how it was a possible future outcome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What was their reaction when they found out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The answer was obvious when I looked at Benimaru&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At the moment,&rdquo; Souei began, &ldquo;the most likely threats are the commanders of the three divisions and the one hundred members of the Imperial Guardians. There may be other strong individuals hidden that we are unaware about, so we are currently investigating. Please forgive us for being pusillanimous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei and the others were currently in the process of gathering information at the risk of their own lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it was all for me&mdash;in order to eliminate threats against me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that the enemy&rsquo;s strength is unknown, sending our king, Rimuru-sama, as the vanguard is out of the question. The operation is still proceeding without any problems, so please trust in me, Gobta and Gabil.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, I sank back down into my chair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although this unpleasant feeling, which was neither annoying nor frustrating, did not disappear, Benimaru&rsquo;s words were right on the mark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yeah. </span><span class="c1">Come to think of it, Benimaru had accounted for me from the very beginning when he was contemplating on how to carry out the operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru wasn&rsquo;t the only one; Shion, who was standing behind me, and Souei, who was standing beside me, were all aware. Diablo was an obvious one, but even Shuna, who looked at me worriedly, and everyone else&mdash;I realized that they were all prepared to lose those who left to fight forever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t just limited to the people who were right here; perhaps the ones clashing on the front lines had realized it as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Use yourselves as bait</span><span class="c1">&mdash;the thought must&rsquo;ve run through their minds as they stood on the battlefield, resigned to sacrifice themselves in order to attract a threat they had yet to see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason why the usually selfish Veldora was sitting quietly in the Control Room: he was there as insurance on the off chance that something happened here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Everything was set up to protect me, the king of this country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was the only one who wasn&rsquo;t ready&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;That&rsquo;s why I have to be perfect.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;I thought I heard a voice somewhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even </span><span class="c5">you</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;were worried about me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I was fine now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My sadness would only be disrespectful to those who had resolved themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, I had to resolve myself as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking straight&hellip;&rdquo; I apologized to Benimaru, and he nodded in response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Victory will definitely be yours, Rimuru-sama,&rdquo; Benimaru promised with a fearless smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the serious look of a general who&rsquo;d been entrusted with the lives of his men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">When I heard those words, the frustration, conflict, and other unpleasant feelings in me disappeared. I&rsquo;d always been ready to kill my enemies and for my own death. Yet, I&rsquo;d never even considered the thought of someone dying for my sake. I needed to accept it. The deed wasn&rsquo;t only for my own sake; I was in a position that symbolized their family, and the framework of a nation that protected and defended them. That was why I </span><span class="c2">had</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to accept that thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In return for their actions, defeat would never be tolerated. A symbol was always a symbol, and with it, there was an appropriate way to conduct oneself. With that in mind, I replied to Benimaru in a composed manner so that I would appear calm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;d like to tell them all what I said. Is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Please do!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Benimaru&rsquo;s consent and cooperation, I transmitted my &ldquo;will&rdquo; to all my subordinates. His Unique Skill &lsquo;Generalissimo&rsquo; allowed me to convey my words directly to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Listen up! Crush the enemy with all your might. There is no need to go easy on them. Naturally, that means there is also no need to show any mercy. Use everything you&rsquo;ve got and eliminate the enemy as quickly as possible!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I gave the order with all of my heart. Benimaru nodded at my words. Smiles appeared on the faces of the other executives. The order meant only one thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We would no longer hold back our suppressed power.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having understood the meaning of my words correctly, the monsters resumed their activities.

They won&rsquo;t send out their top troops unless we scare them a bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta and Gobchi carried out their conversation amidst a battlefield that was bombarded by shells and their subsequent shock waves. Those watching them were amazed at how they could still hear each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone took their communication abilities for granted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If it were up to me, I&rsquo;d want the strongest people to come out first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that you mention it, Commander Gobta is one of the Four Heavenly Kings, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Wait!

They never intended on annihilating them with direct hits, but rather through the destructive power of shock waves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta and the others had seen through their plan and were moving to find a safe zone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A direct hit would kill you instantly; conversely, if it missed, then you could certainly survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The people here were all as strong as a hundred men&mdash;the equivalent of an A-minus rank. Even if they were seriously injured, they could quickly heal themselves using potions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, Benimaru&rsquo;s strategy was to &ldquo;feign distress&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They didn&rsquo;t actually have to lose, they only had to fake being panicked. In the meantime, those who remained were supposed to find the right opportunity to block off the Imperial Army&rsquo;s path of retreat and counterattack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you wait until the tanks run out of ammunition, then the Empire&rsquo;s strongest soldiers will come to finish you off</span><span class="c1">&mdash;Benimaru had told them that as if it was a walk in the park.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wait a minute, please!</span><span class="c1">&mdash;Gobta wanted to complain about the unfair order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Benimaru&rsquo;s command was absolute and could not be refuted. He was scarier than the Imperial Army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Gobta recalled the memory of when he was informed about the operation.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Well, Benimaru-san is usually easygoing, but&hellip;he has no mercy when it comes to military affairs. And this time, it depends on keeping Rimuru-sama safe. It&rsquo;s impossible for me to come up with a counterargument.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was an uphill battle trying to persuade his men, but once Gobta mentioned Rimuru&rsquo;s name, they stopped complaining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterwards, he wanted to overwhelm the enemy in their first push, but that seemed too good to be true. Nevertheless, as soon as the breakthrough was blocked, Gobta and his team decided to revert to their original role as decoys.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, that was now over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A decree from Rimuru and Benimaru&rsquo;s subsequent order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no need to hold back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was time to unleash all of their strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;From now on, you are allowed to attack freely. Master Hakurou will be in charge of the Green Numbers, so Gobchi will lead this team.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta&rsquo;s expression changed as he informed his men with &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo;. His tone was normal, yet there was an unmistakable power behind it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Understood, sir. Then, what are you going to do, Corps Commander Gobta?&rsaquo; Gobchi asked while shrugging his shoulders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta replied with a troubled smile on his face. &lsaquo;We aren&rsquo;t playing around anymore. I don&rsquo;t care about the Four Heavenly Kings, but Rimuru-sama has given me an order. I can&rsquo;t make a fool of myself with Rimuru-sama watching! That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to take things seriously now!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobchi and the rest of the members saw a look in Gobta&rsquo;s eyes and knew he meant business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They almost never got the chance to see this side of their boss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh, now you can use the power I&rsquo;ve recognized in you without any hesitation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Why are you acting so high and mighty?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;D-did you hear me?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Well, that&rsquo;s fine, but Gobto will do his best too, right?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Heh, of course.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Good grief&mdash;</span><span class="c1">Gobta breathed out with a sigh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobto had been one of the earliest members of the squad and knew Gobta since the beginning. He was brilliant in his own way, but given that he absorbed a lot of extra knowledge from Rimuru regarding fashion, he tended to look strange.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the early days, he imitated his adjutant Gobchi, but now he had evolved into something entirely unique. He began carrying two longswords while donning a long black coat. Even though he hadn&rsquo;t mastered using the two swords, he still wielded it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was dressed in a way that made one wonder if he was going to be all right, but with Gobchi there, it&rsquo;d probably work out. Having made that decision, Gobta turned to the person that he needed to worry about the most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person sitting behind Gobta was, needless to say, Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;So, Testarossa-san. I&rsquo;d like to ask you to go separately from here, is that okay?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa gave a slight smile and nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even amidst the chaotic battlefield filled with explosions and shockwaves, she still maintained her elegant mannerisms. Her military uniform remained tidy and clean; mere soot and clouds of dust wasn&rsquo;t enough to dirty Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Oh but of course. I was thinking the same thing. Right now, I won&rsquo;t act as an inspector but as one of Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s subordinates. Everyone, try your best!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Testarossa jumped down from Ranga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After wishing them luck, she walked away from Gobta and his teammates calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru initially assigned Testarossa to be Gobta&rsquo;s inspector, but this role was no longer needed. The dangerous demoness was on the move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">She really is a free spirit&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta was shocked, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. Part of Gobta&rsquo;s growth was to not do such an idiotic thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once Testarossa was gone, he announced that it was their &nbsp;time to shine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, everyone, advance forward!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oooooh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His teammates were satisfied with his command and began their attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Gobta wanted to show Rimuru how cool he was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta liked and admired Rimuru, who could be selfish and mean at times. However, he was also very kind and reliable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the runty goblin Gobta was now a famous warrior. Right now was the best time to repay Rimuru&rsquo;s kindness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gobchi, I&rsquo;ll rely on you for the rest!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he shouted, Gobta gave a signal to Ranga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Ranga-san! Magic Wolf Unification!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ranga, who had been waiting for this moment, replied enthusiastically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here I am, Gobta. I will show my lord Rimuru-sama my powers here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next moment, a black fog wrapped around Gobta. Gobta and Ranga harmonized their consciousness and released their inner magical power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go wild!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yep, no need to have any pity for them. Let&rsquo;s pull out all the stops!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The black mist appeared to be sucked into Gobta, and a terrifying humanoid black wolf with two horns had appeared in his place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was what it looked like when Gobta and Ranga fused into the same &lsquo;being&rsquo;. This was a true representation of the strength of the Four Heavenly Kings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right after seeing the fusion, the Goblin Riders under Gobchi dashed out from where they were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get in Captain Gobta&rsquo;s way when he&rsquo;s serious!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobchi tried his best to warn everyone about how dangerous Gobta was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if to prove his point&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the artillery shells shot from the tanks were smashed to the ground by the wolf&rsquo;s fist. Furthermore, even if a shell hit the wolf, it wouldn&rsquo;t cause any damage because of its hardened black fur.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even huge artillery with &nbsp;tremendous amounts of destructive energy while travelling at just less than six times the speed of sound could not hurt Gobta&rsquo;s fusion with Ranga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was thanks to Ranga&rsquo;s Multilayer Barrier. However, to the clueless Imperial Army, it was more like a nightmare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is that thing? I have never seen something like that before, not even in my dreams&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, this is different! That&rsquo;s a monster, a super strong monster! I hate the damn subordinates of this Demon Lord!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The terrified foot soldiers scurried away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the Armored Corps, who were trapped, were in even greater peril.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Gobta roared, &ldquo;Black Lightning&rdquo; fell from the sky above the tank unit. Nearly a thousand fortified tanks were the perfect target for &ldquo;Black Lightning&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The black lightning strike interfered with the defensive barriers on the tanks and emitted a dazzling light. The tanks only lasted for a few moments, but they had incredible electrical resistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The crew seemed to be safe, but the infantry unit, which had been in formation with the tanks as protection, suffered enormous damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The threat of &ldquo;Black Lightning&rdquo; was not just its electric current.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was also much more powerful than natural lightning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hot! This is causing serious damage to the defense system of the tanks!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone, evacuate from the tanks immediately!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed like the electric shock caused by the lightning strike could be withstood by the soldiers, but they could not handle the heat. The tanks were much worse off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;Black Lightning&rdquo; would bite into the inorganic tanks like a preying snake and cause significant damage to their fragile mechanical parts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tanks exploded quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a loud thundering noise, the tank unit became stationary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When this happened, the tanks that were connected and fortified were nothing more than a prison. The soldiers desperately escaped from the tanks and scurried away in fear of being struck by lightning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Empire&rsquo;s forces looked ridiculous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">This wasn&rsquo;t too big of a deal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta watched and laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He knew that his team&rsquo;s powers were very effective against their enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta even thought that attacking the enemy&rsquo;s main force, which was his original purpose, would be a simple task in his current form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta looked at the wall of tanks ahead of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tanks were emitting some black smoke because of Ranga&rsquo;s thunder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta roared without any second thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The roar knocked over the tank wall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other side of the wall, he saw another row of tanks pointing their barrels at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Enough of this bait. It&rsquo;s time for us to shine!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, our work will definitely please Rimuru-sama,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta and Ranga nodded together eagerly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was time to get started.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta hid in the tank wall without a second thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of the enemies ahead of him in the slightest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, he ran around the battlefield as fast as he could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was faster than the speed of sound, and the Imperial soldiers couldn&rsquo;t even see him with their naked eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you the result of my special training with Ranga-san! Now, let me see if you can keep up with me. Gale Wolves Dance!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A black wind roared around the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time, a supersonic shock wave struck the Imperial tank unit.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1131.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image25.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1131.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This shock wave also had the magical effect &ldquo;Damage Storm&rdquo;, which would progress into a tornado.

If it became dangerous for them, they would calmly move on to plan B.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because of this, they were given the same strategy as Gobta&rsquo;s team, which was to &lsquo;fake distress&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their strategy entailed the following: they would continue acting like they were losing, so that their enemies would show them their trump cards. It was a crazy strategy, but Benimaru gave the orders confidently. Gobta and Gabil agreed to carry it out calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they were actually in danger, they were permitted to withdraw. However, that was only after they helped Gobta and the others escape as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Gabil believed that worrying about this was useless. It was because of Gobta&rsquo;s endless confidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil wanted to have Gobta&rsquo;s insane confidence, but they still had other similar traits. As the battle progressed, he decided to focus his unit&rsquo;s attack on the airships.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil originally deduced that if he and his unit worked together and attacked half-heartedly, it would barely hurt their targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the aerial attack that he planned, but their enemies turned out to be stronger than he had thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They blocked Gabil and his team&rsquo;s magic, as well as the fireballs fired by the Wyvern riders. Right now, Gabil and the others lost their advantage of a one-sided attack, which made the battle shift in favor of the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Our goal is to draw the attention of this airship. If we attacked it with our full strength, we might be able to sink it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as Gabil and others had the Hiryuu as their secret attack, they could damage the enemies&rsquo; airships. However, if they attacked now, then they couldn&rsquo;t continue with their strategy. Gabil decided to wait for the right time to pounce.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Following Benimaru&rsquo;s orders, he allowed his side to be attacked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that came another problem: the Wyvern riders were growing impatient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although they were elites chosen from the Blue Numbers, they had not evolved into dragonewts like Gabil and others. Their magical resistance was low enough that a large-scale magic attack would decimate them, so Gabil told the Wyvern Riders to withdraw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ultima-dono, I have a request for you,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re continuing with our &lsquo;fake distress&rsquo; strategy, but we are also going to do some acting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Acting?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Even if we keep running away, our enemies still won&rsquo;t relent. The best option here is to use the Hiryuu to take the brunt of the enemies&rsquo; magic attacks,&rdquo; Gabil explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; That&rsquo;s a very interesting plan. What&rsquo;s your real goal here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mmm. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it,&rdquo; Gabil replied, &ldquo;but right now I think we should use our situation to acquire more resistances. They wouldn&rsquo;t even die from a direct hit because of our recovery potions. In order to really sell our acting, I&rsquo;m going to take some of their attacks so that it really looks like I&rsquo;ve been beaten up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima laughed at his speech, but the other soldiers expressed their displeasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please wait a minute, General!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gabil-sama, you can be really stupid sometimes&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is this really necessary now? I just wanted to say that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His teammates talked over him as if they couldn&rsquo;t hear Gabil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm, okay! Since it sounds interesting, I&rsquo;ll allow it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful. So then, you can retreat for now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Inspector Ultima withdrew alongside the Wyvern Riders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This left Gabil and the Hiryuu, who decided to perform a special attack on the airship unit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you die then I will never forgive you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t come up with such reckless ideas.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Those guys will definitely be angry with this plan afterwards.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although the members acted cold, they had known Gabil for a long time. Despite their frequent complaining, they were always enthusiastic and motivated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And thus, the magic endurance training for the Hiryuu began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru was worried when he watched it, but after he learned the truth, he almost fainted. When the others learned of the plan, they became displeased. However, some of them had also expected this to happen. Even so, they decided to carry out the plan even if it seemed like they were manipulated by general Gabil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All in all, Gabil and the others were struck by magic cast from the airship, which dealt huge damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil heard Rimuru&rsquo;s &lsquo;voice&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen up, everybody! Training time is over, let&rsquo;s begin the carnage!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil proclaimed the orders with confidence, even though he had no idea that Rimuru was actually worried about their training.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His teammates got up excitedly, and Gabil continued enthusiastically.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lucky that our weaker soldiers withdrew with Ultima-dono. Since we&rsquo;re the only ones left, we can afford to cut loose a little!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s soldiers poked fun at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d much rather fight seriously than keep doing this endurance training!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. Gabil-sama&rsquo;s been reckless like this for a long time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Gabil&rsquo;s face turned red and he shouted,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quiet! Quit joking around and let&rsquo;s get started! Follow me and show your full potential!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His subordinates smirked bitterly, seeing Gabil struggle to hide his embarrassment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You guys are always so serious! Let&rsquo;s get started quickly like Gabil-sama commanded.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m not gonna disobey our general&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah! Gabil-sama, we hear your order!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil heard that and gave a satisfied nod. He then glanced at the Empire&rsquo;s &lsquo;Air Assault Division&rsquo; and proceeded to ask his men loudly,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You guys, I ask you&mdash;who are the rulers of the sky?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We are, the Hiryuu!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s aura became more serious, which prompted his soldiers to do the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Exactly! Those who dare to dirty our sky must be killed. That is what Rimuru-sama wants! This is a decree from Rimuru-sama, so let&rsquo;s do our best! Let&rsquo;s fight like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s order held a special significance to the Hiryuu.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Be careful not to let your ego be consumed! Everyone, &lsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Gabil&rsquo;s orders, the Hiryuu sprang into action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo; was their secret power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their power grew overwhelmingly at the cost of losing control and inciting violence. If their ego was swallowed entirely, they would become wild beasts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo; was a Skill left unused up until now because they couldn&rsquo;t control their thirst for destruction while using it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil had invited Midley to be an instructor to teach them how to control their power. However, the number of soldiers who could successfully do it was low.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so, they would use it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Orders from Rimuru would always be carried out wholeheartedly.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dragon mode!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Hiryuu released their ultimate power all at once. Their muscles bulged and the purple scales that covered them turned black, making them thicker and also way more flexible. With that, they also grew two times larger. By absorbing &nbsp;the magicules around them, they managed to form new bodies for battle. Because of their size increase, their attack and defense power skyrocketed. Needless to say, their past selves were incomparable to how powerful they were currently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then came the issue of their egos&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they lost consciousness, they would become incarnations of power. However, the Hiryuu succeeded in retaining their ego brilliantly. It was now time to display one of Tempest&rsquo;s strongest units, the Dragon Warriors&rsquo;, true powers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can you guys take down the enemies one by one?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good, so let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Gabil&rsquo;s orders, the Hiryuu immediately took action.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who are the masters of the sky? Right now, the answer to this question was glaringly obvious. Among one of the Empire&rsquo;s three great armies, the Armored Corps&rsquo; precious Air Assault Division was nothing more than a poor lamb for slaughter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why was that? It was because the dragonewt&rsquo;s Intrinsic Skill &lsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo; had been activated. As a result, magic attacks were useless against them. Even Megiddo would not affect the &lsquo;Dragon Bodies&rsquo; of Gabil and his subordinates. They had erected two barriers, &lsquo;Multilayer Barrier&rsquo; and &lsquo;Natural Effects Nullification&rsquo;, which nullified all physical, magical, and natural attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The airships&rsquo; main attack used magic, and their secondary machine guns could not penetrate the scales of Gabil and the others. Prior to their strengthening, the Hiryuu had fighting abilities within the A-minus rank. Now, their power transcended the A rank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, during the transformation, they also acquire a regenerative ability similar to &lsquo;Ultraspeed Regeneration&rsquo;. This strength even surpassed that of greater majins&rsquo; powers&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The airships that were unable to even hurt them now met a sad fate. As if he were rubbing salt in the Empire&rsquo;s wounds, Gabil shouted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in! Time to massacre them with my power&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, Gabil was already considerably powerful. But now, he had an insane amount of magicules. He was still weaker than Shion and Benimaru, but he was as strong as Souei and Geld. He utilized his &lsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo; to become a powerful warrior. His newfound strength even rivaled the ex-Demon Lords Karion and Frey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Vortex Crash!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil attacked one of the airships, making it fall from the sky.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1131.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1131.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the airflow swirled, all the moisture in the atmosphere gathered at a single point to form a magical vortex. The attack was released from Gabil&rsquo;s spear and pierced an airship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hundreds of magical barriers enacted by the airship were crushed instantly. Within seconds, the airship sank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although the Hiryuu could not use Vortex Crash like Gabil, they immediately charged towards the remaining airships with their strengthened bodies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the blink of an eye, the barriers were broken, and they stormed the ships. Five teams went in and attacked any Imperial personnel they saw. In no time, the Air Assault Division was eliminated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil shouted happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gahahahahaha!! Our siege is going great! Those who couldn&rsquo;t sink an airship will just have to learn from this, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing that, the Hiryuu who arrived late gave a sour face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were only a hundred airships. Currently, since Gabil wouldn&rsquo;t stop his attacks, fewer and fewer airships remained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle quickly became a competition between the Hiryuu.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This will not do, Gabil-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gabil-sama is easily swayed by the mood of the moment! Today, it seems like he&rsquo;s in a good mood, so he might not leave any prey for us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s possible, since he&rsquo;s one of the generals&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The speed of Gabil&rsquo;s attacks depended entirely on his mood. Knowing this, the members joined the assault in a hurry so they could help out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hunter and the prey&rsquo;s roles had been reversed, and the rulers of the sky had been determined.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

The defense of the Imperial army&rsquo;s &lsquo;Magic Tank Division&rsquo; supply unit was about to be tested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is nice to see everyone following me here. Now then, prepare yourselves for a real battle!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man who announced that was Hakurou, the leader of the Green Numbers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou had a cool and calm expression, but the twenty thousand soldiers that heard him were breathing heavily. After all, they were located way behind the flank of the Imperial tank unit. They had travelled over 40 kilometers, making a detour to get over here from the Dwarven Kingdom. What more, they were all wearing heavy armor&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only thanks to Hakurou&rsquo;s strenuous training that this was possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had thoroughly trained the members and instilled &lsaquo;Battlewill&rsaquo;. As a result, the members were able to perform various arts such as &ldquo;Instantmove&rdquo; which let them move instantly, and &ldquo;Formhide&rdquo; which blocked the enemy&rsquo;s perception of themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Green Numbers had set out at the same time as Gobta and others, so they had to rush to this point so they wouldn&rsquo;t be discovered by their enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to commend you all for being able to use &lsaquo;Battlewill&rsaquo; so well,&rdquo; Hakurou said with a gentle smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The resting soldiers who heard that winced as if something bad would happen, holding their breath with an ominous feeling in their hearts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had trained hard with Hakurou for a long time, and this unflinching &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; treated his enemies more harshly than he treated his own people. Such a man was giving an order after complimenting them&mdash;just imagining it was terrifying. For the soldiers who understood what he had meant, they couldn&rsquo;t allow themselves to hear the next part without any small amount of determination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Our mission right now is to cut off our enemy&rsquo;s supplies. Although it doesn&rsquo;t mean much, if we destroy their backup supply unit then it will severely damage their morale. We don&rsquo;t need to go out of our way to kill their soldiers, but we also don&rsquo;t need to show mercy. Besides&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After speaking this way, Hakurou glanced at the battlefield and smiled. He then continued,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gobta&rsquo;s performance has also turned out brilliant. He is doing very well. You guys cannot let him outshine you! Now then, go finish the battle!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou&rsquo;s voice sounded even clearer and louder than the sound of explosions from far away. His speech made those without any battle experience very anxious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right? Listen up, do not think about other things while fighting. The battlefield follows &lsquo;survival of the fittest&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s kill-or-be-killed. If you let the enemy live, then your teammates will die. This is the ironbound law on the battlefield.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their shoulders had been heaving due to their exhaustion, but before anyone knew it, they were all hanging on the end of each of Hakurou&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He preached his knowledge so that his determined soldiers would not hesitate later on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The value of life is not created equal. Compared to the lives of our loved ones, the value of a stranger&rsquo;s life is meaningless. What&rsquo;s more, the enemies are intruders. Those fools don&rsquo;t even deserve to live! Slaughter them!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou used such strong language so that his soldiers would not feel guilty while slaughtering the enemy&rsquo;s troops.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was Hakurou&rsquo;s way of being kind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Prove to me that you are truly my students by cutting these iron sheds. Or do you all want to fall to the simple rocks they throw at us? If not, then do not waver! There are no enemies under our blades!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nobody could disagree with his challenge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they spoke up, then it meant that they were still &ldquo;too immature&rdquo; to fight on the battlefield, which would solicit glares their comrades.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were some who were still nervous on the battlefield, but they also didn&rsquo;t have any problems with Hakurou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou would never give them an order that they couldn&rsquo;t achieve. His words were harsh, but as a commander, he had to raise the morale of his soldiers somehow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, the Green Numbers set their sights on the tanks. They were all waiting for Hakurou&rsquo;s orders&mdash;to order a surprise attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, he had a lot of pressure on himself as well. He could not tarnish the reputation of the Four Heavenly Kings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battlefield was being watched by Hakurou&rsquo;s Extra Skill &lsquo;Sky Eyes&rsquo;. Then, he would use &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; to share it with the members of the army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His ability was frightening. Furthermore, they were currently being outdone by the Goblin Riders led by Gobta. Everyone knew that they had to do their best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou looked at his army and felt a bit less tense. He had trained his soldiers to be able to handle any type of situation on the battlefield. Even so, during the first battle, there would likely be casualties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Ah, I should have trained them more,&rsquo; he thought. However, it was out of his control, and the enemies would not wait.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s strategy was to keep Gobta and the others in a stalemate with the Empire. By doing that, the enemies would grow anxious. Since the tanks didn&rsquo;t have infinite ammunition, the rain of shells would also eventually end. That would be when Hakurou and his army would attack. By targeting the enemies&rsquo; supply unit and cutting off their supplies, the tanks would become weaker. Another purpose was to lure the Empire&rsquo;s strongest fighters onto the battlefield&hellip; But the chance that they would actually come was abysmal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It would be great if they appeared before us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou wished that they would show themselves, however unlikely it was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">This is everyone&rsquo;s first battlefield, and if they waver, they will die. I should attempt to make them less scared&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou thought that all he could do now was wish for everyone&rsquo;s safety and for the strategy to work, but fear began to blossom in their minds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Listen up everybody!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, Rimuru&rsquo;s voice was transmitted using Benimaru&rsquo;s Skill. Just by listening to his voice, the monsters regained their confidence and became ecstatic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Eliminate the enemies as fast as possible,&rsaquo; Rimuru ordered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou smiled bitterly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My worries were needless&hellip; You guys all heard our new orders, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s destroy them! We have no need to wait anymore&mdash;go and show off your strength!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even before Hakurou finished talking, the monster army began running towards the supply line at full speed.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After around ten minutes had passed, a row of the Imperial foot soldiers guarding the supply unit were stormed by the monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though the attack was sudden, the Empire had anticipated this and quickly reorganized themselves. Some troops used armored transport vehicles to fire at the monsters, which made it seem like the Empire held the advantage. However, the Green Numbers were not afraid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if they were showered by bullets, the scale shields that lined the front line would protect them. Unlike bows, rifles did not form an arc with their projectiles. The point of rifles was close range combat, and unless the front row of shields was destroyed, using their rifles would be futile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The world was still primarily in the age of swords and magic, and the introduction of firearms changed the tide of battles because of their incredible killing power. However, in a world of magic, the damage dealt by bullets was minimal to someone who could use magic. This led to swords and axes being used more than guns. Even the Empire&rsquo;s new weapons were inadequate to bring about a weaponry Renaissance. Since that was the case, then other weapons could be used. Hence, the Imperial commander ordered:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it! Everyone, swap out your rifles with spell guns. Maintenance team, bring our important supplies and join the main team!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Weapons like rifles, which were recreated based on the knowledge of the Otherworlders, were useless when fighting monsters. The only situation it was useful in was against an unarmed monster. That&rsquo;s why the Empire switched from rifles to magic. The Empire&rsquo;s &ldquo;spell gun&rdquo;, which was usable by any soldier, was engraved with the spell &lsquo;Fire Lance&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The commander had thought that the &ldquo;spell gun&rdquo; would be capable of burning at least half of the monsters. Unfortunately, he was just too naive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Green Numbers were equipped with the latest unique-grade armor, including shields produced by Garm, made by processing Charybdis&rsquo;s scales. In addition to repelling bullets, they had another special effect&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold your fire! Magic won&rsquo;t work on the opponent&rsquo;s army!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;The scale shields were precious because of their high magical resistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It really seemed that nightmare after nightmare was befalling the Imperial army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then the elites of the Blue Numbers led by the Wyvern Riders and Ultima came flying towards them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, just spill blood all you want!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Ultima&rsquo;s cutesy voice gave these lovely orders, the ground became engulfed in flames.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a fireball. Although it wasn&rsquo;t that powerful, it had enough strength to kill the Imperial foot soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound of flames also caused the Imperial soldiers to panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Empire&rsquo;s backup, maintenance and medical soldiers were not used to actual battle, so they were unable to adapt to the chaos. As a result, the order for them to join the main unit was ignored and they became severely injured as the damage continued.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou was quite relieved to see the war&rsquo;s situation becoming more one-sided than what he had originally anticipated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey Hakurou-san. These are the ones I was taking care of, but I was wondering if I could leave them with you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind since Miss Ultima asked nicely&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou responded calmly. Ultima then jumped down from the back of the wyvern. His attitude towards his soldiers and other people was scarily different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh really? Then, I&rsquo;ll leave it to you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima acted like a spoiled granddaughter, all cute and pleading. If Veyron or Zonda saw her, they would probably think that they were dreaming.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1131.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1131.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They would never say that out loud, though&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, but by the way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, what is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Never mind. I was just wondering if Miss Ultima has a good relationship with Carrera-dono or not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m curious why Carrera is &ldquo;Dono&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m &ldquo;Miss&rdquo;&hellip;but that&rsquo;s okay since it&rsquo;s Hakurou-san. The answer is simple: It&rsquo;s super bad!&rdquo; Ultima replied while smiling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her expression was cute, but the implications of her words were terrifying. Ultima was incredibly good at acting innocent. Despite that, her true nature was quite cruel. She also had mood swings so frequently that it sometimes seemed like she had multiple personalities. Even so, she still showed respect to her seniors. People like her were few and far between.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a shame.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why did you ask that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;I just wondered if you might know something about Agera, Carrera-dono&rsquo;s subordinate&hellip;&rdquo; Hakurou trailed off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The demon named Agera was very similar to someone that Hakurou knew. Or rather&hellip;They looked identical to each other. That person was Hakurou&rsquo;s grandfather and teacher, Byakuya Araki. That&rsquo;s why Hakurou was interested in Agera. However, the real Agera didn&rsquo;t even know Hakurou existed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;It could potentially be because of his old age&hellip;&rsquo; Hakurou thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um, sorry, but I&rsquo;m not interested so I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Ultima replied bluntly. Then she asked,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re really that curious, then why don&rsquo;t you go ask him yourself?&rdquo; She suggested the idea without much hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing that, Hakurou nodded his head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I must be overthinking it then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s bad to overthink things. But let&rsquo;s talk about this later. Right now, we should focus on the war at hand. If we don&rsquo;t, Rimuru-sama will get mad at us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I will count on your help afterwards.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leaving with a smile, Ultima flew into the sky again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou, who watched her fly away, had a strained face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu, my personal matters are just a distraction from the battlefield. Well then, I must recover from this blunder as soon as possible,&rdquo; Hakurou unsheathed his sword and leapt onto the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

The airships were sky fortresses that prided themselves on being heavily protected by barriers managed by elite mages. And now, one of such seemingly invincible crafts had just sunk due to a single hit from a monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to the Imperial intelligence agency&rsquo;s investigations, it appeared to be a rare species called dragonewt. They were said to have the fighting power of a humanoid dragon, but the one that was in front of him seemed on an entirely different level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that guy a monster?! Was the information that the intelligence agency sent me meaningless?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, Farage thought that they might have sent fake intelligence to get rid of mages and wizards like himself, however he reconsidered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, that&rsquo;s not right. They changed forms right in front of me. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the monster metamorphosis mentioned in my teacher&rsquo;s book&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Within the monster races, there was one that could switch between a form suited for everyday life and a battle-oriented one at will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, the opponents, dragonewts, were monsters that had evolved from lizardmen. With their wings they could fly, and from their mouths they could spew jets of various elements. As B ranked monsters, they should not be underestimated, yet they weren&rsquo;t strong enough to be called a threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;However, the reality was different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Farage asked his lieutenant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The lieutenant also appeared confused by the disparity between the intel they were given and what was happening before them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;S-sorry. According to the report from the staff who measured the energy output of the enemy monsters, they transformed, and as they changed, their energy skyrocketed. He confirmed that it surpassed that of standard A rank several times over!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, you mean&hellip;several times over rank A?! And are you also trying to say that they are also fully immune against magic?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage shouted, but that thought wasn&rsquo;t quite right. Although Gabil and his soldiers had a high &lsquo;Magic Resistance,&rsquo; they didn&rsquo;t possess &lsquo;Magic Nullification&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s just that the magical attacks from the airships weren&rsquo;t powerful enough to break through the &lsquo;Multilayer Barrier&rsquo; that protected them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to admit it, but looking at the situation, it&rsquo;s the only possible explanation. Our magical attacks aren&rsquo;t working, but these monsters are attacking and bringing our airships, our pride, to the ground.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You don&rsquo;t need to tell me, I can see it,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Farage thought, barely able to bite his tongue and get a grip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They only have around a hundred dragonewts, we shouldn&rsquo;t be scared of that, no matter how great their weapons are, they are no match for ours,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;he thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We will definitely win the moment the 300 wyverns flee&hellip;no</span><span class="c1">.&mdash;The truth was, Farage felt uneasy. Backed by his long military experience, he had an unpleasant premonition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My intuition was right, huh? However, what I need to do first is to think of a solution.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;With that thought in mind, Farage glanced at the battlefield once more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Growing several times over in strength; so, that means that those dragonewts are as strong as greater majins. They are Hazard-class&mdash;no, I think it&rsquo;s safe to think that they are equal to Calamity-class at worst, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes sir! That&rsquo;s what I heard from the analysis unit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How annoying. Even A-ranked monsters could be dealt with had magic worked against them. So, what about the lead individual?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Th-That&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it? Speak up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes! Here is the report!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The lieutenant faltered at the report but resumed under Farage&rsquo;s order. Farage was speechless at its content.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ten times stronger? Is this true?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. The testing device didn&rsquo;t raise any errors, so we can confirm that this individual has ten times more energy than the other monsters.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Crazy&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage didn&rsquo;t know what to say next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even his teacher, the repeatedly reincarnating Gadra, couldn&rsquo;t have that much magical energy. That amount was comparable to a demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even the information bureau didn&rsquo;t have the information about that monster, which means that it didn&rsquo;t participate in the tournament held in the monster country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;According to rumors, it seems that he was holding a scientific conference about medicinal herbs. Now that I think about it, it must have been a ruse to hide a Disaster-class force.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oh, so that&rsquo;s why</span><span class="c1">, Farage thought after hearing the lieutenant&rsquo;s explanations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That previous phenomenon was indeed &lsquo;transformation&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It hid its power and let its enemy underestimate them. After confirming the airships only had magic for offense, it showed its true nature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We&rsquo;ve been taken for fools.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calm down, everyone. The opponent is a monster, meaning our victory is assured. No matter what kind of opponent, it&rsquo;s fine as long as we activate the magic canceler and neutralize their moves!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dragonewts were a rare species. Although they had gotten stronger after transforming, they could still be defeated. The airship was a secret weapon made by the Empire to beat Veldora. By using its true weapon, the &lsquo;magic canceler&rsquo;, even True Dragons would be forced to cower before them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even now, the magic canceler was still in operation. It had a wide range of effect, reaching down to the ground. However, this was more of a trial run and was supposed to be used for the battle against Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Disrupting the magicules that monsters were made of could slow them down, and irradiating them with a focused beam could immobilize them entirely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Begin immediately!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As his lieutenants scrambled into action, Farage tried his best to grasp the situation on the battlefield. Excluding the leading enemy, the other dragons worked in teams of five. At the moment, there were twenty ships engaged and less than ten had sunk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The damage was still recoverable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Major General Farage, the device&rsquo;s preparations are completed. However, if we proceed, we will be getting our allies involved as well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No&hellip;nothing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then get on with it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yessir!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What would happen if an airship using magic to fly were to get hit by a magic canceler? Needless to say, without magic, the airship would yield to gravity&rsquo;s pull. And of course, the crewmates would not survive. This meant that Farage&rsquo;s colleagues from the magic corps would be sacrificed. Even so, he didn&rsquo;t bat an eye when he gave the order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Begin using the magic canceler!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The remaining ships moved to surround the airships engaging Gabil. One after another, they blasted magic cancelling radiation from the ship&rsquo;s bows. Due to this, both dragonewts and the airships began falling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sorry, this is a necessary sacrifice&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage opened his eyes and prayed to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The airships fell to the ground and exploded on impact. Neither the crew nor the monsters could have survived it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done it. We&rsquo;re only left with the enemy&rsquo;s leader.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if he isn&rsquo;t affected by the magical effects, he won&rsquo;t be able to resist the shockwaves and heat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Although it required a tremendous sacrifice, hundreds of greater majins paid the price; the act wasn&rsquo;t in vain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A sense of relief washed over the lieutenants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your guard down,&rdquo; Farage snapped, bringing them back to reality. &ldquo;Victory attained by sacrificing our own soldiers is nothing to be proud of. Also, we&rsquo;re not done yet with this individual!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The lieutenants braced themselves when they heard this. Even the demon-lord-ranked individual was becoming immobilized. But his wings were still intact, and he was still flying. With more than twenty ships sacrificed, it would be unacceptable to let the enemy slip away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If only we were up against Gobta from the Four Heavenly Kings, who can&rsquo;t fly. We wouldn&rsquo;t have had such trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Had Gaster-dono&rsquo;s tank unit cooperated with us, even the greatest defense would have collapsed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, he is unable to move due to the magic canceler. If we continue to irradiate him, his body will soon collapse, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t be sure about that. The analysis team reported that his energy level is decreasing at an insignificant rate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing the lieutenants&rsquo; discussions, Farage suddenly felt a chill go down his spine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even with more than seventeen airships use the magic canceler, that could only stop his movements?! Doesn&rsquo;t that mean that even the weakening effect doesn&rsquo;t apply to him?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While pondering this ridiculous situation, Farage felt that he needed to revise his tactics. He understood that this monster&rsquo;s strength was beyond what he imagined. It had taken the combined strength of all the magic cancelers to finally stop him from moving. With some time, it would even be possible to weaken him, but it was surprising to see that such a being, other than Veldora, could even exist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That monster is stronger than Gobta of the Four Heavenly Kings Wait, could it be?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that moment, a thought suddenly crossed Farage&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">That monster </span><span class="c2">was</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;their target, Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage had convinced himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Oh, so that monster </span><span class="c2">is</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Veldora. If that is the case, this extreme amount of energy makes sense,&rdquo; he muttered to himself as the realization kicked in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The lieutenants who heard him had various reactions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, so that&rsquo;s why&hellip; He just got unsealed and is too weak to maintain his dragon form.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Weakened? He&rsquo;s this powerful and you call that weakened? Even his underlings are on par with dragons. Some of them even reached the power of an archdragon, right?&rdquo; Farage scolded the lieutenants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s the true terror of Veldora. A long time ago, the Imperial army lost to him. That&rsquo;s what my master Gadra taught me. Even after being sealed for about three centuries, he still takes pride in his power. You can&rsquo;t imagine how strong he was before it got sealed, can you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After listening to Farage&rsquo;s explanation, the lieutenants nodded their heads in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is true that with such power, Farmus&rsquo;s army wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Major General Farage must be right; this monster has to be Veldora.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Half of the crew agreed but some of them raised doubts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excuse me, Major General Farage. Based on the intel, the dragonewt leader should be called &lsquo;Gabil,&rsquo; correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s obviously a fake name,&rdquo; Farage replied with a smirk. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been weakened ever since he was unsealed, so he just used a different name to keep a low profile before recovering his full power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The lieutenant had no choice but to back down at Farage&rsquo;s explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A monster with a made-up name&hellip;that&rsquo;s unheard of. Then again, I would expect nothing less of Veldora himself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hypothesis was full of holes, but nevertheless, it&rsquo;s what they chose to believe. The crewmates&rsquo; faces lightened up after learning that they were confronting Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We may have lost about one third of our airships, but considering we are up against Veldora, it&rsquo;s to be expected!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can even consider ourselves lucky. Remember that he wiped out the army of Farmus with devastating attacks. We were right to quickly use the magic cancelers and seal his movements.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s right</span><span class="c5">, Farage thought. </span><span class="c2">Veldora is trapped in the magic canceler&rsquo;s rays and is unable to move. He will eventually run out of energy, and we&rsquo;ll be able to kill him with ease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It suddenly hit him: he had managed to snatch the greatest trophy of this war. Farage savored this luck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is the magic canceler&rsquo;s output stable?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problems, the output is stable at 80 percent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How long until it reaches maximum output?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It will take less than an hour. Right now, it is only enough to stop his movements, but soon Veldora&rsquo;s body will begin collapsing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Veldora now only has one hour to live. During this time, Gaster-dono will surely achieve ground supremacy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The lieutenants flew into high gear. Without saying anything, they knew what Farage wanted and communicated to the analysis team. Then they reviewed the plan and identified any issues. It was concluded that the Four Heavenly Kings&rsquo; Gobta would be subdued within an hour. Gobta combined with a demon wolf and became a powerful individual but was still inferior to Veldora. If Gaster&rsquo;s tank unit was serious and used its real strength, he would quickly be overwhelmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We were up against Veldora and his underlings, so our magic attacks failing couldn&rsquo;t be helped. However, the goddess of victory is smiling upon us! If we merely hold our ground, the Empire&rsquo;s long-standing wish will be fulfilled!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage deeply believed this and cheered up the soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Get that vintage, four-hundred-year-old bottle from the collection.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dreamy escape to celebrate avenging the humiliation of the empire. Within an hour, the sediments will have settled in the bottle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ok, leave it to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Can I have some as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before anyone realized it, a beautiful girl with long bluish-purple hair tied in a side ponytail was sitting in the lieutenant&rsquo;s seat next to Farage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hey, when did she arrive?! No, rather, before asking that</span><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was wearing a military uniform which didn&rsquo;t suit her age. However, this formal-looking uniform emphasized her cute look.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage regretted his overconfidence. He had been so sure of his victory, that he had let his guard down. The same could be said for his lieutenants, who were relaxing nearby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The girl must have invaded easily because of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, who are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How had she gotten in here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what was her goal?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was she an ally or an enemy? She had to be an enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, is it no good?&rdquo; the girl unexpectedly replied, in a meek tone. &ldquo;Then I would like tea, please. I&rsquo;ve been observing you guys for so long that I got thirsty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing Farage&rsquo;s interjection, the crew on the bridges turned their heads and widened their eyes in astonishment upon noticing the girl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There should&rsquo;ve been barriers both inside and outside the airship. However, they hadn&rsquo;t raised any alerts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That girl had the most natural look on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you who you are!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage slowly stood up and walked towards the girl, then asked again while taking out his gun. Even so, the girl kept on laughing. She didn&rsquo;t seem the slightest bit threatened while peeking down the barrel of the gun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who exactly was she?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking who I am? My name is Ultima. This precious name was given to me by Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was one of the world&rsquo;s strongest beings, the Violet Primordial.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage carefully observed Ultima and tried to gauge her strength. He figured he could coax a bit of information out of her through conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ultima? Doesn&rsquo;t ring a bell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, that just means that you&rsquo;re ignorant. I came here to interrogate you guys, but I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t have expected much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be dead soon, didn&rsquo;t you know? So, I want you to give me as much information as you can,&rdquo; Ultima said with an innocent smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima&rsquo;s attitude sparked a strange feeling in his gut. For example: From her, he felt the same kind of pressure as he did when speaking to the high-ranked Imperial Guardians.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Could it be that she is trying to overpower me? Am I getting frightened by her?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage began to doubt his own skills. However, the real problem was that this girl sitting right in front of him, Ultima, had managed to sneak into the airship by herself. That was reason enough to be alarmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He suddenly realized why she was here; it was plainly obvious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was because of Veldora, the dragon that was trapped outside the airship. The sight of the symbol of the Empire&rsquo;s victory must have been despairing for the monsters. Some underlings would surely move to rescue him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ultima? She must be a terrifying monster if even the Intelligence Bureau doesn&rsquo;t know about her. She must be an executive under Veldora, a trump card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She must have been a recently appointed executive. She looked no different than a human, but that evil aura was hard to mistake. Fortunately, Farage had an idea of what kind of demon could exert such an evil aura, even if her true identity was unknown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason was that Gadra, Farage&rsquo;s teacher, was a renowned researcher on this subject.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He pointed his gun at Ultima and asked, &ldquo;I know what you are. A demon, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoa, that&rsquo;s impressive. You&rsquo;re correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course I am</span><span class="c1">, he snickered. Such an evil monster had to be an archdemon. On top of that, she was incarnated into a body and had a name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem was Ultima&rsquo;s class.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She&rsquo;s definitely among the nobility. If she is a medieval one, it shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard to deal with her&mdash;but any older than that, like the ancient ones, would be a tough fight. In that case, I&rsquo;ll seal her Skills. Demons without magic are nothing to be afraid of!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With this in mind, Farage secretly gave an order to his subordinates. He ordered the use of the magic cancelers on his airship. That would mean that the magic strengthening rifles would be unusable and that spell guns wouldn&rsquo;t work either, leaving the aircraft&rsquo;s magicians useless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, that was Farage&rsquo;s aim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monsters were no longer a threat if you sealed their magicules. The same went for demons. They wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use their prized magic if they couldn&rsquo;t use magicules.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When fighting against an archdemon, the number of magicians fighting alongside you was irrelevant. Rather, it was better to create a situation of absolute superiority over the demon to increase the chances of winning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Farage continued brandishing his gun, he carefully placed his hand on the saber he kept at his waist. He continued his conversation, hoping to keep Ultima&rsquo;s attention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is surprising to see that Veldora has such a subordinate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Veldora-sama&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukuku, there is no need to play dumb. Considering the situation, I can&rsquo;t think of any other reasons for you to come here other than trying to save your lord!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean? I am Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s loyal subordinate!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinate? No, her goal is to rescue Veldora, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reports had never mentioned Veldora having any subordinates. But it didn&rsquo;t matter whether that demon was working for the demon lord or the dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That was rude. So, you are here to save Veldora, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you talking about? I told you that I&rsquo;ve come to interrogate you about various things. Are you even listening to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that they were unable to reach an understanding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bluffing, eh? There&rsquo;s no point trying to hide it, but I wonder what her intention is&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage became anxious, realizing that he might be misunderstanding something. No, rather, it felt more like he was making a huge mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;So, what do you want to know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima&rsquo;s face lit up with a smile, as if she&rsquo;d been waiting for him to ask. Then with a smile on her face, she asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to know how this ship works and how to operate it. Also, tell me what forces you have left in the Empire,&rdquo; she said, grinning. &ldquo;Tell me everything you know about them; how strong they are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage felt particularly humiliated by her innocent attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It is good timing for my side to experience this. Yeah, I admit that this is kind of bad luck but-what can a person do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He began to feel genuinely worried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The preparations were almost finished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the trump card against the demon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the signal that it was ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victory was definitely coming. Farage regained his composure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukuku, do you really think I would gladly tell you these things??&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think so, but that doesn&rsquo;t really matter. Anyway, is the tea ready? I&rsquo;ve been waiting for ages.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will give you something way better than tea!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shaking off his hesitation, Farage pulled the trigger. The shot signaled the start of the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The airship went under the influence of the magic canceler.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage&rsquo;s gun wasn&rsquo;t a spell gun. It was a military semi-automatic pistol developed by the Colt Firearm firm from the United States. The Colt M1911. It was an antique brought by an otherworlder and was Farage&rsquo;s favorite item which he carefully maintained every day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was loaded with seven plus one rounds and used an especially large caliber, manufactured at great expense. It packed a hefty punch, leading many to call it a hand cannon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it was just a bluff. A conventional weapon was useless against a demon, which was a spiritual being. An incarnated demon might feel a little sting but that was about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a deft movement, Farage released the safety and fired all of his bullets. He wasn&rsquo;t optimistic about this. After all, pissing off an archdemon was a suicidal act.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the bangs subsided, his doubts were confirmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without getting up from her chair, Ultima opened her left hand and dropped the eight bullets on the floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t understand how she did it without magic. The bullet&rsquo;s kinetic energy was nullified and there wasn&rsquo;t even a scratch on Ultima&rsquo;s hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a fun toy. However, I prefer Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way. That was my favorite&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This wasn&rsquo;t the outcome he expected, but he wasn&rsquo;t entirely shocked, either. He holstered his gun and pulled out his saber.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;Imperial Magic Saber&rdquo; worked even under the Magic Canceler. By infusing his own power and circulating the magicules, it had the same effect as a magic sword, which was more powerful than an Aura Sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A magic sword was effective against demons. And if you destroyed their body, then they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to withstand the effects of the magic canceler, he thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ll banish you to the underworld!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage was a wizard and at the same time a brilliant swordsman. He didn&rsquo;t flaunt it, but he was proud to be as good as other famous sword fighters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why he could afford to be calm when his magic was sealed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima also acted unconcerned, as if she weren&rsquo;t even influenced by the Magic Canceler.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage believed that she was just showing forbearance out of pride and that he shouldn&rsquo;t get fooled by her performance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How do you feel now? Being unable to use your magic?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima tilted her head, puzzled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukuku. Are you getting anxious? This chat is over, demon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The atmosphere surrounding Farage changed, and an invisible thread of tension was stretched between him and Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh. You&rsquo;re not up for it, then?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, who would be stupid enough to negotiate with demons?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stupid? Hey, are you referring to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Idiot, is your skull too thick? Well then, you wanted to know the Empire&rsquo;s elite soldiers, learn that I&rsquo;m one of them!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage watched for Ultima&rsquo;s chance to speak as he thrust towards her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A professional stabbing technique. A deadly blow aimed at Ultima&rsquo;s heart. One that even majins couldn&rsquo;t avoid. Except for&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will kill you last.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage heard a voice coming from his back. Farage&rsquo;s deadly blow not only failed to touch Ultima, who was supposed to be sitting on the chair, but it also left a hole in the seat. As impossible as it may seem, Ultima had slipped behind him. He couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine if you&rsquo;re not interested in a conversation. But you still have to answer my questions. Don&rsquo;t worry, you don&rsquo;t need to talk, I can get the answers on my own.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima looked around at the soldiers with an innocent smile. Then she began speaking in a hideous tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I will start with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage turned around in panic when a round object whizzed past him. It slammed against the wall, leaving behind a big splotch&mdash;that &lsquo;thing&rsquo; being a human head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the lieutenants, who had just lost everything up above his neck, then collapsed to the floor, convulsing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What the&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know anything, so I guess I&rsquo;ll keep going.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While saying that, Ultima continued to randomly behead enemy soldiers, tampering with them for a few seconds before discarding them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the number of victims increased, the airship transformed into a hell of screams and fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ma-maximize the magic canceler&rsquo;s output! Contact the other ships and order them to shoot at this one!&rdquo; Farage shouted, snapping the panicked magicians back into reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers hurriedly followed the order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that magic canceler one of your newest weapons? It seems like it works by shooting disruption rays that scatter the movement of magicules so that spells get cancelled. Sure, it works on monsters, but did you really think it&rsquo;d work on me?&rdquo; Ultima muttered, tilting her head like a puppy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bluff!&rdquo; Farage shouted, &ldquo;You think you can bluff your way out of this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, you don&rsquo;t understand. If we were talking about a monster whose body is made up of magicules, it&rsquo;d undoubtedly be super effective. But don&rsquo;t you think that you&rsquo;re just wasting your effort with incarnated demons like me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Besides, what&rsquo;s the point of using that against a higher being? As long as we&rsquo;re conscious, magic comes to us as naturally as you breathe. Observe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as Ultima said that, her figure disappeared. At the same time, the head of the communications officer, sitting in the last row, shot into the air. It was done by Ultima, who moved there instantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;See? Just now I moved and sent this guy&rsquo;s head flying. I went faster than sound but there was no shockwave, right? It&rsquo;s because I used magic and&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima flicked her wrist and her fingertips seemed to blur for a moment. Immediately, the head of the second in command, standing next to Farage, burst with a bang.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to create this kind of shockwave using the laws of physics, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima spoke with an innocent tone while committing such atrocities. She didn&rsquo;t feel the slightest shred of guilt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How come&hellip;&rdquo; Farage muttered to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Ultima&rsquo;s words finally reached his mind. The common sense he had cultivated over the years got in the way of his understanding of the situation. It was a strange experience, as if she were speaking a foreign language, from some far away country. The truth was that he </span><span class="c2">refused</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to understand it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Were archdemons really like that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage was still pondering Ultima&rsquo;s identity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She should&rsquo;ve been on par with an archdemon. Had she been a newborn demon, he would&rsquo;ve been able to defeat her handily. Although he couldn&rsquo;t defeat ancient species or even older beings, he could&rsquo;ve put up a good fight, if not win, against a viscount class or lower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what was this current situation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The magic canceler, that could even seal Veldora, turned out to be completely useless. The named archdemon, who called herself Ultima, was unusually strong, even when knowing she incarnated. Her power defied Farage&rsquo;s common sense. He realized that no matter how hard he struggled, he couldn&rsquo;t beat Ultima. That&rsquo;s why he was willing to use his trump card against the demon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get cocky you demon! &ldquo;Spirit Summoning: Ifrit.&rdquo; Greater fire spirit, come forth!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the strongest summoning magic only available to heroes. Farage initially couldn&rsquo;t pull it off by himself. But the ship&rsquo;s magic-enhancing cannons and the presence of fifty mages made it possible. Additionally, spirits were barely affected by the magic canceler, so the summoning went unhindered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An Ifrit, a fire giant, manifested and destroyed the bridge on the spot. Spirits had a natural advantage against demons. So, a greater spirit should be able to win against any archdemon. Farage was sure of himself and shouted at Ultima, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit that you are a monster. However, we have been extensively researching demons, that&rsquo;s why we are fully prepared for this kind of situation. Too bad for you, now meet your doom!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima continued to smile as she listened to Farage&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was at this time Farage learnt how frightening a smile could be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Impossible. It can&rsquo;t be. There is no way she can defeat Ifrit&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Ifrit summoned by Farage was powered up by fifty magicians through the magic enhancing cannons. Naturally, its power was several times higher than the usual greater spirits. No matter the class of the demon, be it an ancient or prehistoric species, it couldn&rsquo;t be defeated by an archdemon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so, Farage still couldn&rsquo;t stop his nagging fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get so carried away by summoning a weak and useless thing. It would have been best for you to speak while I was still smiling. Now, I&rsquo;ll bring you despair.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ah, we&rsquo;re done for.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It slowly dawned on Farage, he could feel it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And his intuition was right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next moment, Ifrit, the embodiment of power, froze and shattered in front of Farage and his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was caused by the elemental magic &lsquo;Frozen Hell&rsquo; that Ultima used without being noticed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?! It&rsquo;s a monster!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What the hell!! What the hell is that?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fools wept and wailed before the river of sorrow. They were all terrified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a natural reaction because before their eyes stood the very embodiment of death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s resume the interrogation!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima&rsquo;s cheerful voice was the last thing heard by those unlucky souls.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few minutes later, Ultima nodded with a big smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was happy to have gathered all the information she wanted. It should be impossible to steal all of someone&rsquo;s knowledge, but for Ultima it was a piece of cake to read people&rsquo;s brain waves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima was a military attach&eacute;, and bringing back information was part of her mission. If the results were satisfactory, her master, Rimuru, would be pleased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I would be happy with a compliment</span><span class="c1">, Ultima thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She then glanced at the sole survivor, Farage. He was the only one whom Ultima ignored during the massacre. Of course, it was on purpose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You called me a fool; this deserves the greatest fear. If you try hard enough, you will survive, so give it your best,&rdquo; Ultima whispered and began casting her magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A fist-sized black fire started growing in Ultima&rsquo;s right palm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A-a-ah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage knew this magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was an Abyss Core, an uncontrollable hellfire created after casting a specific chain of spells. The ultimate magic, said to lie beyond the grasp of human hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Except that wasn&rsquo;t the whole story, because unbeknownst to Farage, some humans could control it. The heroes of humanity, the Seven Luminary Clerics, had achieved that feat with three of them working together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the Abyss Core produced by Ultima was an order of magnitude larger than the one produced by the Seven Luminaries. Even Farage who wasn&rsquo;t aware of this fact could recognize it as a strategic threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima tossed it with a casual flick.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, take care. Bye bye!&rdquo; she said right before she left.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage was stunned and stood up. The mystery over Ultima&rsquo;s identity no longer mattered to him anymore. He realized that the end of his life was in sight as soon as he laid eyes on the Abyss Core. He understood that he couldn&rsquo;t stop it. And that was true. Farage&rsquo;s powers were all meaningless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if to ridicule his efforts, the fire that left Ultima&rsquo;s control expanded and spread everywhere. Shortly after Ultima took off, a black fireball swallowed the entire flagship and exploded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turning into the ultimate destruction magic&mdash;the nuclear magic Nuclear Flame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Farage, the last man on board, could only whisper,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How beautiful&hellip;this is the pinnacle of magic&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With an ecstatic expression on his face, his body burned, swallowed up by the black flame. His body was reduced to atoms and his soul experienced the pain of being burned alive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Master Gadra, have you ever experienced such a miracle?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;No, that&rsquo;s not possible&rsquo;&mdash;Farage asserted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He understood that the magic interference of the magic canceler was useless if dominated by stronger thought waves. As proof, this beautiful magic of destruction served him endless despair. His life ended in misery, but it was also by the blessing of being surrounded by the quintessence of magic.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Farage&rsquo;s Air Assault Division was completely obliterated by the Nuclear Flame. The super-heated flames caused primary damage and were followed up with shockwaves from the explosion. The flagship was vaporized by the extreme heat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ships in the vicinity were also blown to bits, turning their hulls into deadly shrapnel. The fragments tore through the air at hypersonic speeds, devastating the surrounding area. This enormous explosion sealed the Empire&rsquo;s fate. Only the first airship to fall to the ground remained intact. All others that remained in the air got caught up in the chain of explosions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, the Empire&rsquo;s trump card, the Air Assault Division, was defeated in humiliating fashion, ending in complete annihilation, without ever engaging Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Seeing the swelling fireball, she nodded in satisfaction. She remembered Rimuru&rsquo;s order to do her best, and wondered if she should have increased the power a little, but the &nbsp;realized that she would have killed all of the Hiryuu members on the ground had she done that. So, in that regard, she figured she had done the right thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A big tragedy had happened in the air, but none of the Hiryuu were hurt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, actually, some people had failed to meet the quota and later suffered the consequences&hellip;but that was none of Ultima&rsquo;s business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was more concerned about Gabil&rsquo;s behavior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gabil-san, what were you doing a while ago&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For some reason, he had been mistaken for Veldora when he was trapped by the magic canceler, but that didn&rsquo;t matter to Ultima. She wanted the squad to evacuate quickly to not get caught up in the Nuclear Flame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima flew to Gabil, which was a hassle, but it couldn&rsquo;t be helped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on a minute, Gabil-san, just what were you doing a while ago?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, Ultima-dono! Actually, I gained a new sensation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil, for some reason, proudly answered Ultima&rsquo;s question. She was curious about that, but evacuation was the main priority. Ultima herself wouldn&rsquo;t die from her magic, but Gabil wouldn&rsquo;t be able to withstand the damage. He might survive, but she didn&rsquo;t want to take any chances. To avoid adding friendly fire to her record, she forced Gabil to evacuate with her.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Hiryuu gathered together on the ground. Finally, it was time for Ultima to deliver her assessment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what the hell was that?&rdquo; she demanded in a stiff tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from her role as military attach&eacute;, Ultima was tasked to monitor Gabil&rsquo;s actions as an inspector general. She must not only support him, but also advise him not to take any wrong actions. Gabil&rsquo;s failures were Ultima&rsquo;s failures. It was no wonder she was being harsh with him. He, on the other hand, seemed to have missed the memo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gwahahaha!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Actually, while I was getting blasted by the enemy&rsquo;s special rays, I discovered that they specifically affected magicules. So, I thought it would be interesting to experiment and see how much I could endure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rimuru-sama better scold this lizard,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ultima thought, barely managing to hold her tongue while she continued listening to his story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&ldquo;So, just what is this </span><span class="c2">new sensation</span><span class="c1">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right! Listen carefully, you guys. With regards to our Intrinsic Skill &lsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo;, Midley-dono said that the more we were used to it, the longer we could use this Skill. And in fact, I remained transformed for a long time, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil spoke with a smug look on his face, looking around at his friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Hiryuu who heard it looked at each other with surprise. Their transformation only lasted a dozen minutes on average and they had all returned to their original form by now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought it came down to Gabil-sama&rsquo;s talent, but I guess there was more to it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, can we do it too, if we know the secret?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s subordinates started chattering among themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima&rsquo;s eyes turned deadpan as she watched the dragonewt&rsquo;s excitement. She wished the most painful experiences upon these lizards. Ultima gave no mercy to her enemies, and she never held herself back when treating her subordinates. But strictly speaking, Gabil and his army weren&rsquo;t her subordinates. She would anger her master if she treated them the way she wanted. Best case scenario, he would only get a little angry&hellip;but remembering how furious Rimuru was when his subordinates were hurt, there was a good chance that the punishment would be particularly harsh&mdash;worst case scenario, she would face exile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima couldn&rsquo;t bear that thought. Weighing the stress relief and the punishment, she chose to endure this with tears in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil then called out to Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all thanks to Ultima-dono that I discovered the secret of this power, because she believed I had this idea, she went and bought me time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, there&rsquo;s no need to hide the obvious, this Gabil here can see through it. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to grow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That being said, Ultima didn&rsquo;t feel too bad. She regained her composure and slightly raised Gabil&rsquo;s rating in her mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ok that&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; Ultima cut in. &ldquo;By the way, Gabil-san, what did you find out? Everyone seems to want to know about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima stopped trying to correct Gabil&rsquo;s misunderstanding. Now she had decided that it was more important to get the situation under control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, the battle operations had become localized.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were three locations: The rear under Hakurou&rsquo;s command, the center where Gobta &amp; Ranga rampaged, and the enemy headquarters where Testarossa was heading.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that Gabil and his team had completed the extermination of the air force they were tasked with, they had to provide assistance on the other divisions. There was no time to dilly dally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll report this to Rimuru-sama as well, but first, let&rsquo;s keep it simple. It&rsquo;s going to increase your strength, so you guys should listen carefully.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, Gabil began to explain with a serious expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was about the complete control of &nbsp;&lsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This Intrinsic Skill of the dragonewts was a special Skill that granted strength with an outburst of magicules. The runaway magicules would take in surrounding substances and strengthen the user&rsquo;s body. By increasing one&rsquo;s mass, one would enhance their defensive power and heal their injuries instantly. Magic would be unusable because of the rampant magicules, but using Skills such as &lsquo;Breath&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. It was a wonderful power that was continuously strengthened as long as one was safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And it seems that the enemy&rsquo;s attack effectively disrupts the movement of magicules. I felt that my power was being further &nbsp;strengthened under their fire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is to say&hellip;stronger than you are now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Ultima was shocked by the unexpected effects of the magic canceler. Gabil currently had a magicule capacity comparable to that of Clayman&rsquo;s pseudo awakening. If he could get even stronger, then his words would be worth listening to. It was no wonder that Ultima was surprised to hear that just letting the magicules run wild would increase their power and that it could even exceed an awakened demon lord&mdash;True Demon Lord&mdash;by numbers alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But alas, that was too good to be true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that. My power increased, but I couldn&rsquo;t handle it well. That&rsquo;s why I was concentrating on feeling the rampaging magicules in my body. But&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The result was that he became unable to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though he remained unharmed, Gabil was completely immobile. With nothing to lose and nothing else to do, he learned how to feel the magicules.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As Midley-dono told me, it&rsquo;s a &lsquo;state of selflessness.&rsquo; Look into your inner universe and listen to its voice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stop rambling and get to the point!&rdquo; Ultima snapped, with agreement coming from Gabil&rsquo;s men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; Gabil nodded, feeling the pressure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In short, by feeling the magicules&rsquo; violent rampage, I was able to send a &lsquo;thought&rsquo; to it. That&rsquo;s how you can control your powers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Murmurs of doubt started spreading among Gabil&rsquo;s troupe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima, on the other hand, pondered. After looking at Gabil and his men, she realized that what was as easy as breathing for her could be an insurmountable task for them. This thought got her hooked on the subject.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hmm? Meaning that If I train them, perhaps Gabil-san&rsquo;s subordinates could become even stronger?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that were possible, it would be a significant help to her lord. And if she could pull it off, there was a high chance she would receive praise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand what Gabil-san is saying, but let&rsquo;s save this talk for later. Right now, I think it&rsquo;s better to provide support to Gobta-kun&rsquo;s corps.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, Ultima declared the break to be over. She had initially planned to report that Gabil was slacking off, but since he had given her useful information, she decided to respond with kindness. Just this once, she decided to overlook Gabil&rsquo;s shenanigans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right! Let&rsquo;s head out to support the other corps.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil happily nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a complete misunderstanding, but from Ultima&rsquo;s point of view, there was no problem. It was more convenient to leave it like that without saying anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t meet your quotas, be prepared for re-education later!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;ll help you with that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima cutely smiled, thinking that this was a very good idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil and his corps went back to the battlefield, unaware of Ultima&rsquo;s intentions.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

There was no denying that there were already more tanks destroyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had already known that defeat was imminent at this point in time, but the pace of the battle was faster than he had expected, and so he had missed the timing to withdraw. He couldn&rsquo;t even report the situation to Calgurio, who was the corps commander of the Armored Corps as well as the commander-in-chief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I have to report this to Calgurio as soon as possible and get permission to withdraw&hellip; </span><span class="c5">Gaster&rsquo;s reasoning appealed. </span><span class="c2">But&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if he reported, it would be denied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The main unit led by Calgurio was already in operation. If Gaster&rsquo;s side withdrew, then the main unit would be isolated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The main unit, the &lsquo;Augmented Legion,&rsquo; was deployed in front of Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s base. These soldiers were the pride of the Empire, each of whom had undergone modifications, and had an overwhelming force of 700,000. Even the main unit, which was sure to triumph, would not be able to escape unrest should they know that the soldiers succeeding them had withdrawn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Dwarven Kingdom army had also made its move. In that case, they would be caught in a pincer attack with that army and Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s forces. That meant the supply line would be cut off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even without sleeping or eating, the Augmented Legion could operate for about a week. But that was the limit. As long as you were human, a supply line was absolutely necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My mission is to conquer the Dwarven Kingdom&hellip; If we withdraw from this battlefield, we will abandon Calgurio and the others. Even if we can&rsquo;t win, we have to at least keep the deadlock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that was a tough call.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All Gaster could see was his army&rsquo;s defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Confusion had also occurred in the rear, and the chain of command was disrupted. Friendly fire was starting to occur. At this rate, it was only a matter of time before they got annihilated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lieutenant General Gaster! If this goes on, we will be destroyed either way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We need to withdraw, please give the order!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster needed not to hear his men&rsquo;s advice as he also thought the same. However, to say it out loud would mean that the responsibility for defeat would rest on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This man called Lieutenant General Gaster had a good reputation within the army, as well as a good personal valor. He was not used to such a situation because he had never experienced such a setback before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We cannot withdraw. If we do such a thing, I will be executed by His Majesty. I can never allow that! I will become a champion. Yet, my chance to achieve that will be gone. At the very least, I must find a just reason as to why it is not my fault, or else&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The strategy in which the prestige of the Empire was on the line would end in failure because of him&mdash;this thought unmasked Gaster&rsquo;s true character. He thought only of his own self and did not care about sacrificing his men. Gaster was that kind of a lowlife.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lieutenant General, if this continues, it will be difficult to even regroup the troops.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is not a shame to retreat. If we let this confused battle continue, it will only worsen the damage to our allies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After receiving such a proposal, Gaster finally began to think. Either way, he would not be able to escape punishment if he lost the troops he was entrusted with. Far from demotion, even his life would be taken without trial.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shit! I&rsquo;m a man who will become a champion. And yet&hellip; Everyone&rsquo;s getting in my way, these incompetent, unhelpful bastards!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster cursed, fully revealing his ugly nature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, there was a loud explosion that drowned out Gaster&rsquo;s voice. This threw the people in the headquarters into confusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-it is an attack by an enemy&rsquo;s magic!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Magic? D-don&rsquo;t tell me, it&rsquo;s nuclear magic?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is still unidentified, but from the scale, I am sure it is. However, err&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?! Just say it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes sir! About the enemy&rsquo;s offensive magic, it appears to have easily broken through the legion magic for our army&rsquo;s counter-magic defense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wha&mdash;?! Then, what&rsquo;s the status of the damage?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The explosion occurred in the sky. We have lost contact with our allied airships!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s absurd?! Are you saying the airships, the Empire&rsquo;s valuable &lsquo;Air Assault Division&rsquo; has been wiped out&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Things began to unravel one after another. This could only lead everyone to understand that the damage was more serious than imagined. It was not only one airship they had lost contact with, but all of them. They could only assume that those had been wiped out by </span><span class="c2">that </span><span class="c1">magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The airships were equipped with a new weapon that could disrupt magicules called magic canceler, and yet they were defeated by magic. This was hard to believe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s withdraw. No, this is&hellip; Right, we&rsquo;re just going to retreat and readjust our positions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster commanded, but more so to himself rather than the soldiers. Gaster had finally made the decision to withdraw from this unpalatable situation; however, it was definitely too late.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Do not tell me this is the end. I have already told you before, once you invade, we will show no mercy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster&rsquo;s eyes, hurriedly turning to where the voice was, reflected a pale and beautiful face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had a full smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I may not look it, but I am a woman of my word. When I came into this world before, I had properly fulfilled the wishes of those who had summoned me. You may rest assured.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fear grasped Gaster&rsquo;s heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not a mere terror wherein he was thinking about his own protection; it was a fear that undermined instincts and threatened the very foundations of life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&mdash;witch!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara? I wonder if you forgot. What a rude gentleman you are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa responded with an expression of motherly affection, as if she was looking at a troubled child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster could never forget.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although it hadn&rsquo;t been long since they&rsquo;d parted, even if many years came to pass, her pure white hair and scarlet eyes were a charming sight one could never forget.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beyond that, it was terrifying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa&rsquo;s beautiful face was a source of unfathomable aversion for Gaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Repressing his fear, Gaster tried to order his men to attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet no one was to react.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I do not know what you wanted to do, but your subordinates are sleeping. I guess they must have been very tired. After all, they cannot seem to get up anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa softly whispered in Gaster&rsquo;s ear. They&rsquo;d been talking face to face, but before he knew it, she was already standing behind him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster had never let his guard down and taken his eyes off her. And yet, Testarossa moved unnoticed. She moved at a crazy speed. What was scarier was that she did it with no sound at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster&rsquo;s Unique Skill &lsquo;Musician&rsquo; could sense an opponent&rsquo;s movement by sound. It could pick up the faintest of sounds that no expert could control&mdash;not just the heartbeat, but also blood as it flowed through the body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite that, Testarossa completely produced no sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was then that Gaster realized another terrible fact: he was also unable to hear any sound from his fallen men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were all dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-you&hellip; Did you kill my subordinates?!&rdquo; Gaster inquired, as he staggered away from Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa answered him unapologetically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara? I was a bit hungry, so I ate a little.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ate a little? What did you eat?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, a little bit of the soul.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She said it as it was nothing, and this enraged Gaster. His anger overwhelmed his fear, and so his body regained its strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Die, evil demon! Mind Requiem!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taking advantage of that momentum, Gaster brought forth his greatest secret technique. He spread an inescapable, lethal sound wave into the surrounding space. This sound wave had a special effect wherein it affected the mind of intelligent life and caused death. It was Gaster&rsquo;s trump card, also effective against spiritual lifeforms such as spirits and demons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even then, Testarossa smiled sweetly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aah, what a pleasant sound. It is such a waste that it was from a human. It is unfortunate. Because I have to kill such a wonderful musician.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa murmured, her dreamy look clouded over by sadness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing her like that, Gaster understood that his attack didn&rsquo;t work. Then he was overcome with despair. He was deluded by her beautiful appearance, but Testarossa was undoubtedly not from this world. And worst of all, she was in an incredibly higher plane of existence. Gaster had finally realized that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Perhaps, she is much stronger than that rampaging humanoid monster wolf&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, she was definitely dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Are you saying there are numerous creatures such as this monstrosity scattered about in this country?! If that&rsquo;s the case, we might have mis-planned our strategy from the very beginning&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster regretted it all too late. At the same time, he foresaw the failure of the Empire&rsquo;s military operation. On top of this, Tempest had a close relationship with the Catastrophe-class threat that was Veldora. While they already had a certain chance of defeat in this battle, the possibility of victory was practically nil. Because of that, Gaster screamed desperately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, I want to negotiate!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara, let me hear about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m a high-ranking individual in the Empire. I&rsquo;m well-versed in military operations and hold confidential information.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster begged for his life, casting aside his shame and his reputation. But there was still light in his eyes as he watched Testarossa very carefully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster seemed to be at the end of his rope, but his vaunted ears picked up the sound of several people approaching. He recognized the identity of those approaching. They ran so noiselessly that only Gaster could notice it. Just by hearing their footsteps, he intuitively felt that they were the men of the Imperial Intelligence Agency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it was the Imperial Intelligence Agency, then it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if they sent out agents to monitor the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the head of the Imperial Intelligence Agency and rumored to be the &ldquo;specter that fed on information,&rdquo; Tatsuya Kondou was probably taking every measure he could take.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I will be saved</span><span class="c1">&mdash;Gaster decided to believe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He thought that he would have his life saved if he bought some time no matter how shameful he may appear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason why Gaster was able to believe so was because he knew a rumor about the Intelligence Agency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Among the Intelligence Agency members were those called agents, who possessed first-class combat skills and trained to perform in all environments. The names of such strong individuals were unknown because they didn&rsquo;t participate in the Rank Battles. They belonged to the Imperial Intelligence Bureau and were not reassigned from there. Intelligence agents were those who were detached from the mundane world and worked under the mysterious otherworlder named Tatsuya Kondou.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was nothing more than a rumor. But while there was no credibility, Gaster had to believe in the rumor. If those who would come were mere soldiers, then it was over. But if they were agents, then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Gaster&rsquo;s cooperation, they could beat Testarossa. For this reason, he was doing everything he could, even begging for his life, to buy time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Gaster won the bet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This presence&hellip; You&rsquo;re a demon&mdash;no, an archdemon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone shouted and several soldiers rushed out in front of Gaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster was thankful for his good fortune. He finally understood upon hearing she was an archdemon&mdash;physical attacks didn&rsquo;t work on her because she was a spiritual life-form. And an archdemon&mdash;the highest rank for a demon&mdash;at that. It was a dangerous being equivalent to Calamity-class. Only a champion-class could fight against such an individual. Gaster could win against her, but it would be a desperate battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ooh, who are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three men had arrived. Gaster recovered his composure upon seeing them and asked in a contrived manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yessir! I am from the Intelligence Agency&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Gaster predicted, they were from the Intelligence Agency. One of them tried to say his name, but a man who looked like their leader in their center stopped him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi, wait! I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the time to introduce ourselves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man, who pointed that out, looked grim once he saw Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem like a mere archdemon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like this one has been incarnated. Tsk, no wonder she has such a weak presence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gaster-dono, we will introduce ourselves later. First, I ask you to join us and defeat this evil demon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm, that goes without saying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The leader told Gaster, and he could do nothing but agree. It was exasperating to take the initiative, but the priority here was to survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The men of the Intelligence Agency surrounded Testarossa in excellent coordination. And they sealed Testarossa&rsquo;s movement from three sides using chains made of a monster&rsquo;s hair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This move was unfamiliar to Gaster, but this was what was called Imperial sealing formation. By becoming a trinity, they could seal a powerful monster&mdash;yes, even an archdemon. It was the greatest killer formation passed down in the empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The secret was in the chain. It was the chains of forged holy silver, woven with the hair of a monster. It was a treasured article equivalent to legendary-grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who were able to manipulate them were not simple soldiers, but disguised figures of the Imperial Guardians affiliated to the Imperial Knights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Number 11, Davis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Number 38, Walt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Number 64, Gordon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Imperial Knights essentially acted in groups of three when going undercover. Imperial Guardians also had a ranking, and it was customary for the person with the lowest &ldquo;number&rdquo; to become the leader of the group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was said that there was a gigantic gap between the strength of the top 20 and those in the 30&rsquo;s and beyond. Those under the number 30 were only individuals who had reached Sage-class&mdash;a realm out of reach of humans and of those who possessed strength close to that of &ldquo;Saint,&rdquo; which reigned over the Sage-class.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was one such person here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lead figure during the Lakeshore Dyed Scarlet incident&mdash;Davis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis&rsquo;s team, which had sealed off the nightmarish white primordial Blanc, had arrived in Gaster&rsquo;s plight.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon seeing how the &ldquo;knights&rdquo; sealed Testarossa in a trinity, Gaster became relieved and applauded in his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he continued to feed her with his Mind Requiem, she would perish even if she was a spiritual lifeform.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A moment ago, living things were included in the target of the Skill, but now he adjusted it so that only the psyche was affected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was Gaster thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, he was too naive with his perception.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This strategy was under the premise that the target was not incarnated. And since Testarossa possessed a body, it was meaningless if it only affected the mind. Inevitably, Gaster&rsquo;s hope would be dashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But before that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara, ara ara. This is so nostalgic. You were the ones who had defeated me, no?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This makes me glad. I was not able to eat enough because you had interrupted me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa&rsquo;s voice reverberated, full of wickedness. Despite being sealed, there was no hint of tremble in her voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way, this evil presence!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That face?! It&rsquo;s&hellip; Blanc?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding! Are you saying after all the trouble of sealing it, it came back so quickly?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing all three of them so shaken up, Testarossa laughed. The way she did it was very evil, yet still very beautiful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tee-hee-hee. That&rsquo;s a nice expression. Fear and uneasiness. And unfounded confidence. You are all just an incompetent bunch, pretending to be brave, yet you are still not running away from me. Really, you gentlemen truly must like useless effort.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up, demon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, we didn&rsquo;t expect you to resurrect this soon, but did you forget? We sealed you once before. Wait until you have beaten us before showing off!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Exactly as what Davis-san said. We shall destroy your soul this time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The proclamation was rather laughable to Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara ara, how interesting. You are so full of confidence that I wonder if you are all okay. Do you think that the exact same technique you used at that time would work on me again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa questioned them gracefully even while she was still in the captivity of the Imperial sealing formation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just unwilling to admit defeat. Only a fool would listen to a demon&rsquo;s drivel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gordon is right. There&rsquo;s no place for ya here. If you didn&rsquo;t understand that the first time, then we will bury you again and again until you get it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gaster-dono. Leave this to us. Please order everyone to leave immediately!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis was always imperturbable. The appearance of Blanc was unexpected, but he did not forget their original purpose. Davis intended to defeat the monster wolf&mdash;Gobta &amp; Ranga. That was why he asked Gaster to withdraw the troops to hide their identity from the public.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis, unfortunately, held no power to command a high-rank such as Gaster. In the worst case, they planned to eliminate Gaster, but with Blanc appearing, the situation had changed. They couldn&rsquo;t hope to win against Blanc while hiding their identity. More importantly, he was afraid that the whole army would get caught in their battle if they didn&rsquo;t evacuate immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without realizing Davis&rsquo;s sentiment, Gaster started moving like a sort of afterthought. Gaster just couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Blanc? What&rsquo;s that about? Don&rsquo;t tell me she&rsquo;s that, that great demon? No, this is not the time for that. Rather than trying to find out who they are, it&rsquo;s better to get out of here alive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gaster worked the gears of his head to find the optimal solution in this situation. Then, hurriedly, he tried to issue an order to withdraw to the entire army using his Unique Skill &lsquo;Musician.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it was all too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment he encountered Testarossa, all hope was already dead.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

It was the so-called Lakeshore Dyed Scarlet incident.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The formidable white primordial Blanc that ruled the demons of the East had manifested and was about to be incarnated. From that day, vigilance against demons had changed completely. Demon countermeasure offices had been in every city, and demon summoning was forbidden by law.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, if an archdemon were to be incarnated, it would become a situation that required a whole army to deal with. If unlucky, it would be such a terrible disaster that a whole town would perish. And worst, the demon was a primordial.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were the fearsome lords of demon kind on a different plane of existence even amongst the archdemons and had the strength that couldn&rsquo;t be measured by mere magicule count. Davis had thought it was sheer luck that brought Blanc down. But at the same time, he was confident that they would never lose no matter how many times they fought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was because Davis was Number 11.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the strongest and most celebrated champions in the surface could not rival the true mighty individuals who had lived in the shadows for more than a thousand years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The guardian of the great country of Farmus, the majin Razen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Champion King Gazel of the Armed Nation of Dwargon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the otherworlders Yuuki Kagurazaka and Hinata Sakaguchi, or the Magus of the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Dynasty of Sarion and the Holy Knight Order of the Holy Empire of Lubelius.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Any force would be obscured in the face of the Imperial Guardians. And among this strongest group, the &ldquo;Single Digits&rdquo; held a very special meaning. Davis, who was Number 11, held the position to assist them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His Majesty had endowed us the strongest armor. With that combined with my strength, there&rsquo;s no way I can be defeated by any demon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis believed as such, raising his confidence. After urging Gaster to retreat, Davis shouted at his crew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do the &ldquo;unsealing.&rdquo; Although it appears that Blanc has gained a body, I&rsquo;m sure she has not accumulated that much magicules yet. Let&rsquo;s bring her down with all our might!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Roger!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gordon agreed while Walt gave a fearless laugh. At the same time, the pendants which had hung from the trio&rsquo;s necks shined. The light became a torrent and enveloped their bodies. Then they appeared as warriors in a full golden plate mail. It was a legendary-grade gear given to the chosen. While the weapons varied from person to person, their armor was of uniform shape. It was the highest-grade equipment handed down from ancient times, which could not even be seen by any ordinary means. Now that they had put it on, Davis and his crew could fight in full power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re unlucky, Blanc! Although you have finally incarnated, you&rsquo;re naive. Meeting us her will be your ruin!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis put strength to the hand that was gripping the chains to finish off Testarossa. And then, he noticed that she was not resisting. Testarossa, who was supposed to have been sealed, had slipped out with a nonchalant look on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you think I would let this go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis turned around to the chilling voice. His eyes were on Testarossa, who had laid her hand on Gaster&rsquo;s neck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a dull thud, and Gaster tumbled down. He was helplessly killed by Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis unconsciously muttered, disoriented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Gaster was a man who was full of himself, he was not weak in the slightest. He was competent enough to hold a high rank of lieutenant general. Enough so that it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if he was chosen to be an Imperial Knight. Of course, he would have been a low-ranking number, but still, he was not a man to be killed off so easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And yet</span><span class="c1">&mdash;Davis shuddered upon looking at his hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The chains forged of holy silver, interwoven with the hair of a monster, were destroyed as if to show that a rare weapon equivalent to legendary-grade was futile against her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agitation and confusion shown not only on Davis&rsquo;s face but also on Walt and Gordon&rsquo;s. It was as if they couldn&rsquo;t see how Testarossa broke the chains when she moved. And yet, only further suffering awaited them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did I make you wait? If so, I apologize. This man was trying to escape so I punished him a little. Because if I didn&rsquo;t, it would go against Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s orders. I had no choice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa looked at the three and said as such with an enchanting smile. And then, as if she remembered something, she added:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, by the way, it&rsquo;s been bothering me since a while ago, but would you please stop calling me Blanc?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You see, I have a name&mdash;Testarossa&mdash;so please do not call me that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This line only brought despair to Davis and the other two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait&hellip; A name&hellip; You have a name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Testarossa&hellip; Is there really someone foolish enough to &ldquo;name&rdquo; a primordial?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Incarnated and even possessing a name&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was unheard of. Now they had no choice but to admit that the war situation was against their odds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We need to withdraw. We must report this crisis to His Majesty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I agree. I will hold her off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, I shall cast the elemental magic &lsquo;Warp Portal&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The trinity formation was meant for such a situation. They quickly decided what their roles were going to be, and Gordon began to chant the transfer magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soon after, Testarossa laughed wickedly. Her face was lovely, beautiful yet very ominous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Walt shouted, he held his spear and charged against Testarossa. However, Testarossa was long gone. Walt couldn&rsquo;t keep up with Testarossa&rsquo;s movements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shit, where did she go?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A breath passed through Walt&rsquo;s ear, and a sweet, aromatic smell filled his nasal cavity. Without even looking back, he could tell it was Testarossa. Walt felt a delicate hand of a woman around his neck. It was so cold that it could freeze even his soul.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">AAAAAAAAAAAAAH&mdash;?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What appeared in Walt&rsquo;s mind was an image of Gaster, who had just been killed.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I really hate incompetent people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa&rsquo;s words may or may not have reached Walt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Snap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walt collapsed with a look of sheer terror on his face. Walt, Number 39, had been killed by Testarossa. Seeing this, Davis felt utter despair for the first time in hundreds of years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hurry up, Gordon! She killed Walt. She&rsquo;s too dangerous!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although involuntarily, his shout was tinted with fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if he already knew, Gordon nodded without saying anything. Then, the transportation magic was completed, and a magic circle that floated on the ground shone out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo; Davis ordered, entering the circle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The magic circle didn&rsquo;t activate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t believe this&hellip; Why?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if to mock the discomposed Gordon, Testarossa gently explained,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What can you not believe? I am using the magic canceler right, no?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Davis and Gordon didn&rsquo;t understand what she was talking about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you say? Magic canceler&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you saying you replicated it with magic&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa sighed in disappointment as she looked at the two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa had been sharing information with Ultima and Carrera through &lsquo;Telepathy Net.&rsquo; Among the information she obtained was the magic canceler installed in the airships.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Testarossa, replicating technology from obtained information was child&rsquo;s play to her. However, such a feat was beyond common sense. It was too much for Davis and Gordon to comprehend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What they could understand was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&hellip; What are you?! Even if you were a primordial, there&rsquo;s no way an archdemon could wield such a power!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">David barked, as if to conceal his fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s right. You were not this powerful when I fought you before! What in the damned hell you did to evolve to this point&mdash;evolve?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis and Gordon looked at each other. Gordon heard his own shout and was finally able to understand the current state with Testarossa. He understood, much to his dismay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same was true for Davis. Incarnated and named&mdash;That was the kind of a dangerous being the White Primordial, Testarossa, had become.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa looked at their faces pleasantly. And then she spoke in a calm manner to answer the question that boggled them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara, you clever boys. Correct. By obtaining a name, I am now superior to an archdemon. I wonder if you know the word demon peer. Its &ldquo;class&rdquo; is completely different from an archdemon. It is quite sad that I had to tell you about this for you to understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was an answer that plunged them to an even deeper despair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;D-demon peer&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A second&hellip; Guy Crimson&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only then that Davis and Gordon grasped the gravity of the matter. This primordial did not manifest merely for idle sport, but settled in this world with firm will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&hellip;you should have lost interest in this world when you lost the body of the princess&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is incorrect. My contract with that lady had already ended when you all came. I wanted to stay, but I left for that reason.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara, I am sorry. Did you, perhaps, really think that you could defeat me? Of course, that is impossible, you foolish one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This didn&rsquo;t make any sense. Davis felt his confidence crumble to pieces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At that time, how dare you interrupt my meal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-hey, Davis&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both Davis and Gordon had been unable to move since the moment Testarossa stared at them with her crimson eyes. Like frogs being stared at by a snake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Your meal?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All Davis could do was buy time through this conversation. With the valuable time saved through this, he was trying to find out, in desperation, what caused their body to act like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are right. The blood did not fully sate my hunger even if its amount had fully dyed that beautiful lake scarlet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Almost ten thousand innocent people had died!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That was part of the contract. Besides, you all got in the way before I got to my main dish, the most important one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You hell spaaawn!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Testarossa who caused the Lakeshore Dyed Scarlet tragedy. But the demon called such a horrific tragedy a mere meal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And yet it was not enough&hellip;?!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis&rsquo;s heart burned with furious anger. The flame of justice had burned off the fear poisoning him. Davis injected vitality into himself with a single purpose: never let this evil run amok in this world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;An evil being like you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a gleaming sword in his hands, Davis braved to escape Testarossa&rsquo;s spell. This was then rewarded with his body regaining strength&hellip; Unfortunately, though, his despair had only just begun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Testarossa, you still won&rsquo;t kill them? I was trying not to interrupt because you seem to be busy, but you should wrap things up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A cute voice, which didn&rsquo;t belong on a battlefield, was heard from above. It was from a girl with a long dark purple ponytail.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis, being ranked 011, could see that she was quite an oddball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the tone of her voice towards Testarossa made it feel like they were close, suggesting that she was equal, or near in class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara, how lovely to see you, Ultima. Did I make you wait long?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;m not one to talk since I was also just chilling with Gabil-san and the others, but Rimuru-sama did say to go all out, so you should hurry up and finish up, or he will get mad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That would indeed become a problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I met some old friends, and so I unintentionally had a long chat. But you are right. I shall finish up before Rimuru-sama gets upset.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis wasn&rsquo;t able to comprehend the conversation taking place in front of him&mdash;no, it wasn&rsquo;t because he couldn&rsquo;t, but rather because he didn&rsquo;t want to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is crazy, this is crazy, this is crazyyyy!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa and Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a doubt, they were on a different plane of existence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Two demon peers</span><span class="c1">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Handling a single one was already too much, and this reinforcement meant certain death. Davis&rsquo;s flame of justice were once burning hot, but before he knew it, it had completely been extinguished, like wet coals. It was all out of fear. The glory of being Number 11 meant nothing in the presence of Testarossa and the other girl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis could&rsquo;ve single-handedly finished them off if they were merely archdemons. But reality was about to break his spirit, for these two were demon peers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was inevitable. In fact, Gordon had already cowered and wept. He had once been a quiet and reliable man, but now he looked like a mere child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis suddenly found himself envious of Walt, who had died before them. He had welcomed death without having to realize the true identity of his opponent. He was very lucky&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah! That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, although it pains me, this is farewell. Oh right, since you are old acquaintances of mine, I will show you a magic that suits your wishes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa cheerfully told Davis, who was dumbfounded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without even realizing what that meant, Davis understood that his end was near.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Out of a profound darkness came a black flame. This black flame condensed to the size of a fist and glowed on Testarossa&rsquo;s palm. An Abyss Core&mdash;this uncontrollable hell flame was easily crushed by Testarossa with her hand. She smiled and murmured as if singing: </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;Death Streak.</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis opened his eyes wide. He had no idea what that magic was. He failed to comprehend it. He did not understand it. Still, he was certain of one thing&mdash;it was an extremely evil magic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That boy over there also knows Guy Crimson, right? Then I suppose he also knows this magic. This is what Guy used to become a demon lord&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was where Davis had unfortunately lost his consciousness. He wished he had lost his consciousness before hearing that. And then, he was consumed by an even deeper despair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Abyss Core that Testarossa crushed illuminated the surroundings in a black light. The light had the property of penetrating almost all matter. It was dark light, which did not arise spontaneously. It had no physical destructive power, but it had a certain characteristic. When it penetrated an organism, it would affect its genetic structure. With a forceful rewriting of genes, almost all living things would be forcefully killed. A pure evil magic of death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, legend had it that its purpose was different. Only a spiritual lifeform or one whose soul had the capacity to remember could endure this magic. Only those who could resurrect even after their physical bodies were completely destroyed could escape from it. The special particles that made up magicules&mdash;spiritrons&mdash;emitted a special wave. That was the dark light. It was difficult to fend against using magic and impossible to ward off physically. You could only counter the spiritrons by striking them with other spiritrons. Similarly, dark light could only be countered by dark light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once you were exposed to this light, your probability of dying was 99.999 percent. In rare cases, however, some people survived. One in a million would gain a new life by becoming a monster. In other words, this magic was also a magic of blessing, bearing the role of selecting people who had the superior aptitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This kind of magic was the most evil of forbidden spells.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t like Disintegration, which was more of a physically-destructive force. This magic only penetrated the Information Particles, with perfect precision. It was the nuclear magic: Death Streak, the ultimate forbidden magic that could even destroy the &ldquo;soul&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this way, Number 11 Davis and Number 64 became the first preys of the &lsquo;Death Streak&rsquo; activated by Testarossa. Following this, a violent gust of death within a limited radius of 500 meters raged on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This magic could not distinguish friend from foe and would kill all the creatures in its range. That was why Testarossa made sure to check whether allies were present within its range with &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo; before using it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she did not put a limitation on the magic, organisms within a radius of several kilometers would have been dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Death Streak&rsquo; could also affect spiritual lifeforms. But it was carefully cast so as not to damage the &ldquo;soul&rdquo;, so it was harmless to Testarossa and Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At a casual pace, Testarossa and Ultima checked the aftermath.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seems like there&rsquo;s no one alive here. All things considered, you did a good job Testarossa!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara, about what exactly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;These playthings called tanks. You were able to keep them in great condition, so we can examine them once we bring them home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Naturally. I deliberately eliminated only the humans for that exact reason.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have cut corners and just used &lsquo;Death Streak&rsquo; instead. I wouldn&rsquo;t have destroyed those floating playthings if I did so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree, Ult&rsquo;s magic was very flamboyant. Anyway, we can still retrieve the first samples that fell. They are sufficient data.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Right. Frankly, those toys were so brittle that I did more damage than intended. I planned on destroying only one but ended up breaking a lot of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That cannot be helped. We became stronger after Rimuru-sama named us. You just need to be more careful, Ultima.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah! I learned from this incident. Speaking of which, I&rsquo;m more concerned about Carrera. I doubt she even knows the word restraint, because we both know how she loves really flashy magic.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is why she is on standby at the headquarters. I am very much impressed with Rimuru-sama for anticipating even that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aah, I see! That&rsquo;s a relief then!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was how the conversation between the two went. They had a mistaken idea about Rimuru, but there was no one there to correct them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru-san was also too worried because there&rsquo;s apparently someone in the Empire that can harm Rimuru-sama. He wanted us to be discreet to lure out that being.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that is a bit of a problem. If it&rsquo;s simply a matter of gaining victory, just sending us over from the beginning would be enough. That way, the things that could bother Rimuru-sama will be gone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As for that, this was Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s policy, correct? He told us not to fight. Perhaps Rimuru-sama wanted Gobta-kun and Gabil-san to grow up. Rimuru-sama could easily evolve them, but they would have to improve their fighting experience by themselves. A misguided man who is only powerful is just a small fry in our eyes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a great idea, and I understand, but still&hellip;it&rsquo;s a shame, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At least there was still a chance to take a turn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa and Ultima, who were in high spirits, were carefully collecting the souls of the dead during the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, there was a secret behind the Death Streak spell. There was no successful case of turning a person into a monster with this spell. The possibility of turning into a monster by this spell was &ldquo;only if the soul was left&rdquo;. If the souls were reaped as in this case, the chance of survival was completely zero.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The truth was hidden, perhaps as a kind of story of the devil&rsquo;s deception of hope. Naturally, Testarossa and Ultima knew this very well. That is why they judged that the battle was over when there were no survivors on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa&rsquo;s heart was not moved by seeing the end of those who stood in her way. She was not moved by it and treated them just like anyone else. It was a natural result, since Testarossa had never had any interest in them in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, Testarossa&rsquo;s battle was over.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two of the Imperial &lsquo;Armored Corps&rsquo; had engaged in this operation, the &lsquo;Magic Tank Division&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Air Assault Division&rsquo;, and both suffered a complete defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the death of Lt. General Gaster, the Operations Center was silenced, and the end-generals, unable to grasp the situation, began to lose ground, and the battlefield turned into a war of annihilation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Magic Tank Division&rsquo; led by Lt. General Gaster had 200,000 men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Air Assault Division&rsquo; led by Major General Farage had 400,000 men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a commander, the Imperial Army had no way to request a ceasefire. Thus, every single Imperial general lost their life on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the moment when the victory of Tempest was decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this did not mean that the war was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was because General Calgurio, the commander of the Imperial &lsquo;Armored Corps&rsquo;, still did not know about the defeat of the Imperial forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And currently, the main force of the Imperial &lsquo;Armored Corps&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Augmented Legion&rsquo;, was advancing towards Rimuru, the capital of Tempest.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1128.82px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.88px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c5 c22">Interlude</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c25">The Melancholy of Gazel</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Upon seeing the scene reflected on the large screen before him, Dwarf King Gazel fell silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My liege, I see a look of panic on your face. If this has you so worried, it shows that you still have a lot to learn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Old hag Jaine, the appointed archwizard, jabbed at Gazel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say that, Jaine. Not even I know how to react, seeing conventional warfare turned on its head like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Replying to this, Admiral Paladin Vaughn gave off a difficult look in Gazel&rsquo;s place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He couldn&rsquo;t blame him for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With technology provided by Rimuru, they were able to prepare large screens broadcasting the on-going battles live. Even the Hero King Gazel found the situation rather baffling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like the &lsquo;common logic&rsquo; of warfare has already been completely toppled.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After saying this, Dolph, Commander of the Pegasus Knights, answered tiredly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;These weapons are called tanks, I&rsquo;m certain that even the &lsquo;Magic Barrier&rsquo; conjured by legion magic would not stand a chance. Were we to confront them without prior knowledge, we would be doomed to failure. With that being said&mdash;even with its menacing power, as we were told in advance, it seems we could actually stand a chance against it by constructing trenches and earthen barriers&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone agreed with his view.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obviously, a single earth barrier would not be able to defend their attacks, but with several layers set up, they could dampen the destructive power of tank shells. As such, this was what had been concluded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a solution formed from Rimuru&rsquo;s knowledge. Although the battle had already ended before they even had the chance to try it, based on calculation of the weapon&rsquo;s capabilities through the live feed, they had reached the &nbsp;conclusion that this weapon did not in reality have an overwhelming power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From the looks of the Empire&rsquo;s equipment, they seemed to have prioritized mid-to-long distance combat as opposed to close-quarter combat. Were there not any heavily-armed soldiers? They all seemed to be carrying light equipment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have tried to investigate regarding that observation. I heard that the Empire had developed a new type of weapon called &lsquo;Spell Gun&rsquo;. It is a weapon that would allow even the most incompetent soldier to master magic with ease. Moreover, they also seemed to have equipped some of their troops with this Otherworld weapon called &ldquo;Guns&rdquo;. Looks like the Empire had already determined close-quarter combat to be outdated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The age of swords is over, it&rsquo;s only natural for the Empire to think in that way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph nodded thoughtfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This weapon called a &ldquo;Gun&rdquo; allegedly could pierce through iron armor with ease. When confronting these tank troops, even castle walls would seem obsolete. These weapons seemed to almost intend to mock the weapons and armor, which the dwarves regarded as their main industry, as outdated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is not the Otherworld. Even the military tactics that worked well there need to be well incorporated with the concept of magic to be usable here&mdash;Is that what you are saying?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Precisely. Even though &ldquo;Spell Guns&rdquo; are also a threat, they were very unlucky with their opponent. His Majesty Rimuru has had an abundance of scale shields from the encounter with Charybdis. He has generously shared some with us. With these shields, most magic attacks would not be effective.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Utilizing the concept of magic, they could combat many modern weaponries. While on the other hand, the enemy&rsquo;s magic would be rendered ineffective by their defense. One could say that these perfect counters for each of the aforementioned matters was a disaster for the Empire army. The Empire&rsquo;s over-emphasis on mid-to-long distance combat also made them significantly more frail upon closing in distances. This was a huge misstep in terms of tactics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No matter what situation one faces, it is ultimately the way one plans and conducts that matters. We shouldn&rsquo;t make the same mistake as them. We must put all the information we gain from this war to good use.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Gazel concluded as such, though in his heart, he thought </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;But that is all secondary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was something far more important than weapons and tactics, but he did not announce it out loud. That aspect was the individual strength of each monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some obvious examples would be Gobta, Ranga and Gabil. It would seem that even the monsters serving under them had improved greatly too. In addition to that, the mass-produced healing potions with no cost allowed them to engage in a more dangerous style of combat as well. Unlike before, Rimuru&rsquo;s nation has managed to harvest Hipokute grass in mass and in terms, could supply large amounts of healing potions. That was something that flipped over the common logic of warfare as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, what&rsquo;s even more&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;King Gazel, could I perhaps advise you on something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No need. I already know what you have to say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Be that as it may, this matter requires addressing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jaine&rsquo;s tone was rather heavy. It was a word of advice meant for everyone in the room. Having been acknowledged by Gazel&rsquo;s silence, Jaine opened up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Those demonesses were very unusual. The spell that burnt those flying ships ablaze was a form of ritual magic, the Greater Spell&mdash;Nuclear Flame. It was something even I would have trouble casting by myself. The magic used by that white-haired lady was even more problematic, a move called Death Streak&mdash;to my knowledge it was not something the human body could control, a forbidden spell&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone listened to Jaine&rsquo;s words in silence. They all observed the unusualness of those demonesses from just the few days they spent together with them. Head of the Night Assassins, Anrietta had previously looked into their backgrounds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These women were new-hires in the Tempest Federation. Allegedly, they had come out of nowhere having been brought in by Rimuru&rsquo;s right hand man, Diablo. Their true identities were of the demon race, and sources pointed to the fact that they seemed to be old acquaintances of Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru had said that he appointed them as intelligence officers and sent them to oversee each corps. Gazel had suspected that things were not as simple as they seemed, and it would appear he was on the mark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In truth I have been wondering about this before, could it be that they are&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words, Your Majesty had already guessed the true identities of those young ladies?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-yeah&hellip;but it&rsquo;s probably for the best to stay ignorant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What nonsense is that?! We have all seen the absurd battles they fought; it frightens me more not knowing the truth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Jaine had a point, the scariest things about those demons were their combat capabilities. Even Gazel seemed to be on the verge of uttering </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gotta be kidding!&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as he was watching.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Besides, we have already prepared ourselves for it. My liege, even you were shocked by them. Your emotions were written all over your face, so we&rsquo;ve all managed to piece some of the puzzles together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jaine said so thoughtfully as the others nodded along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were Dolph, Vaughn and Anrietta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turning to face his reliable companions, Gazel also made up his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It happened during the night of that festival.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Are you referring to </span><span class="c2">that</span><span class="c1">? The time that you were invited to the country of monsters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that you mentioned it, His Majesty Gazel was invited to some sort of a secret meeting. We were all placed in the next room waiting. What happened then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s regarding Rimuru&rsquo;s secretary&mdash;or butler I suppose. I believe you&rsquo;ve all seen him, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, you mean Diablo-dono. He seemed like quite the gentleman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There seemed more to him than it appeared. What is it with that guy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who attended the &ldquo;Tempest Founding Festival&rdquo; had all met Diablo. Anrietta was protecting Gazel in the shadows, so she also knew what each of Rimuru&rsquo;s executives&rsquo; looked like along with their names.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only Jaine was unaware due to her absence before Gazel dropped the shocking news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;According to Elmesia, Diablo is a &lsquo;Primordial&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo; &hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-Hold on a second. What are you talking about? My liege, what was that you just said?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jaine&rsquo;s face suddenly turned pale, on one hand, praying that she had heard wrong, on the other hand, asking Gazel to verify. However, reality is cruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that he is a primordial. And the one that comes to mind is Noir. Only, he is not bound by his own domain and travels at will. There were accounts of people seeing him all over the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Realizing he couldn&rsquo;t hide it anymore, Gazel decided to spill the beans. He explained rather calmly, yet as good as a calm look he put on, he could not fool Jaine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, hold on a second! My liege, hold on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;what is it&rsquo;? Are you saying that that primordial&mdash;Noir, has become Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinate?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is indeed the case.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;T-That&rsquo;s a HUGE problem! Why have you stayed quiet until now&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jaine shouted in despair. As she did so, the others followed, rubbing salt into the wound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Could that mean&hellip; Miss Testarossa and Ultima were also&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-Hey, that&rsquo;d just be a bit too&hellip; Just too much. Surely, they are probably just Diablo&rsquo;s servants, some more ancient demons, right?&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph and Vaughn made a somewhat optimistic inference, yet it was quickly rejected by Anrietta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Besides those two, I heard that there were many others who were recruited by Diablo-dono out of nowhere. From the looks of it, they all seemed to be Diablo-dono&rsquo;s subordinates, however&mdash;the military attach&eacute; Testarossa, chief prosecutor Ultima, Chief Justice Officer Carrera&mdash;these three seemed to have been acquainted with Diablo since a long time ago&hellip;They appear to treat each other as equals.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi oi, are you serious now?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;His Majesty Rimuru is acting way out of line this time&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;S-So you are saying there are three people who are considered equal to a primordial? There&rsquo;s no way&hellip; But certainly, what the two of them just did was&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While everyone wanted to deny this matter, the truth itself was fairly obvious if they were to put everything they had seen into consideration. At the very least, even Jaine could not tell the true strength of Testarossa and Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I told you all that it&rsquo;s best to stay ignorant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo; &hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In any case, perhaps I was wrong to have stayed quiet about the matter concerning Diablo. But what could we do even if I had shared it? While it would be an entirely different matter if he were up to no good, Rimuru has personally promised to keep him under check. I also decided to trust the words of my junior. It&rsquo;s just that I could have never expected him to go and find more primordials!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s not really the point at all</span><span class="c1">&mdash;While everyone thought so, they determined it would be meaningless even if they protested it out loud at this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speaking of which, I have already made my resolve the moment I chose to believe in Rimuru. They already have the &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo; on his side, it&rsquo;s already too late to do anything else now. You guys should make up your minds too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not that simple. Be that as it may, Gazel was not entirely unreasonable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very well, I have always put my faith in you. If it&rsquo;s someone you trust, I do not oppose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. I have seen His Majesty Rimuru with my own eyes. He was a trust-worthy man, so I concur with King Gazel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am my liege&rsquo;s shadow; your wish is my command.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Geez. I have faith in you as well. I&rsquo;ve actually met His Majesty Rimuru before he became a demon lord. It&rsquo;s just a bit frightening to think that all the unbeatable powerhouses are concentrated on his side&hellip;but alas, it is all too late. Besides&hellip; We can&rsquo;t do anything about it, so there&rsquo;s no use thinking about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing Jaine&rsquo;s words, everyone agreed. Perhaps they could have argued about a solution had there been one, but this was an unsolvable problem. Trust or not, these were their only options.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pause on the matter for now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel adjured the discussion with these words. Did this mean the war had come to an end? Not necessarily the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though the army closing in on the central area of the Dwarven Kingdom had been eliminated, the situation was still at a standstill in the eastern region. Moreover, an air of danger still lingered around the Tempest Federation&rsquo;s capital Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speaking of which, that brat Rimuru&hellip;He&rsquo;s already achieved a major victory, is he really not satisfied with the result? What a terrifying guy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it is possible that this was not His Majesty Rimuru&rsquo;s intent. Perhaps the Empire has yet realized its army&rsquo;s defeat, and so had not paused their invasion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm, that&rsquo;s very likely too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel nodded along to Dolph&rsquo;s comment. Had the Empire realized the massive defeat they had suffered, they would most likely have disengaged promptly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My liege, moreover, the Empire likely communicated through magic between their armies. Now that the state of war was so quickly turned to a defeat of this extent, it would be hard to believe even if they were to see it with their own eyes&hellip; So surely if others were to receive reports of this massacre, they would question the authenticity of the report if not treating it as the enemies&rsquo; deception.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I probably wouldn&rsquo;t believe a report like that either. General Calgurio of the Empire is not inept, but I doubt he could decide to retreat at this point. He&rsquo;d probably end up being mocked as a coward if he were to. The fools back in the Empire probably won&rsquo;t fully comprehend the situation here and retreat unless they properly get defeated for once.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both Jaine and Vaughn&rsquo;s judgment were fairly reasonable. Gazel also thought that had he been with the Empire, he would have made the same judgment. He only pitied the officers and soldiers on the frontline in this battle&mdash;But that would just be a burden the invaders would have to bear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel was famed as a wise ruler, but right now the Empire was his enemy, and he did not intend to give them any leeway. Besides, he was not obligated to do that anyway. He needed to hold his position firm with a cruel heart to anticipate what came next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Two-hundred forty-thousand of the nine-hundred forty thousand strong army invading the Great Jura Forest has been eliminated. Surely Rimuru&rsquo;s victory has been secured now.&rdquo; Gazel muttered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose so. But it&rsquo;d be rather naive (or perhaps cute) for him to get careless now&mdash;That&rsquo;s not the type of person His Majesty Rimuru is.&rdquo; Vaughn followed him up rather thoughtfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, just how big of a sacrifice would the Empire army have to endure&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We have to make sure this war is recorded, perhaps to serve as a lesson. Let all humanity know this by heart to never advance against a demon lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;YES SIR!&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The logics of warfare had been shattered, and while the theories about the monsters&rsquo; strength were merely induction, they most definitely had reached Catastrophe-class. It was perhaps thanks to luck that Rimuru and his subordinates&rsquo; goal was not to dominate the world, but rather to co-exist and prosper alongside humanity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Empire was truly suffering the fruits of their own labor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to not let their sacrifices go to waste, Gazel decided to witness this war all the way to the end. Moreover, he had to make preparations for the worst-case scenario. That is, if he were to ever become Rimuru&rsquo;s enemy&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While praying that things would not come to that, he had to consider what to do if push came to shove. Even though he proudly told his companions that he believed in Rimuru, that was merely his personal sentiment. As the ruler of a kingdom, he must consider all possible scenarios to minimize harm done to his people. He could not stop simply because of a seemingly unsolvable issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;That being said, it would be utterly foolish to go against a primordial. Nor could we win against Veldora. Honestly, surrendering is our only option&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Struggling against such an unattainable issue, Gazel felt beyond troubled.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image13.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1128.82px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.88px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c5 c22">Chapter 3</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c25">Labyrinth Siege</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">I remember telling them to give it their all. There was need to worry, I shouldn&rsquo;t be old enough to be losing my memory. It had only been three years since I was reincarnated. There was no need to worry about that. That being said&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watching the scene projected on the big screen, I wondered if I had really said those words or not. After all, the big screen was showing the great victory of our army. That was good and all, but the content was just too terrifying. It was completely a one-sided war of aggression that would make anyone go &ldquo;oof&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobta was running on the battlefield and crushing tanks in a way that was so cool that it did not look like him at all. Since Gobta had &lsquo;assimilated&rsquo; with Ranga, his appearance and strength were truly worthy of the name of one of the &lsquo;Four Heavenly Kings.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil had also transformed into a majin-like form of the dragon lineage and crushed the enemy ship with a single blow using some kind of unusually powerful energy reaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only Gabil, but all the Hiryuu had also transformed, so that was no joke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I soon realized that the secret was the &lsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo; ability, but I wondered since how long they had been able to master it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In all honesty, I hadn&rsquo;t realized that the effect of &lsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo; was so tremendous. I had put it aside and forgotten about it until now. There appeared to be a time limit to it, so it could only work for a short period of time&hellip;But there was such an amazing enhancement that it could compensate for any such disadvantages. If used incorrectly, it could be a suicidal act, but I thought it was perfect as a trump card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the large explosion that occurred in the air made even the fortified Gabil seem pale in comparison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t know what kind of crazy thing they did, but a thermonuclear explosion occurred on the enemy&rsquo;s flagship, and the Imperial squadron of airships all exploded in flames.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That surprised me as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, the air power of the Empire was destroyed in that moment. Every single ship fell to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the start of a massive offensive by the Tempest forces. With Gobta and Gabil joining forces, the battle was now, by all accounts, in our favor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even in modern warfare, helicopters held an overwhelming advantage over tanks. In the same way, Gabil mainly used breath attacks from the sky, which inflicted damage unilaterally on the ground forces of the Imperial Army. Because of their small target, the tank guns were not a threat. Simply put, if they couldn&rsquo;t hit, it was nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Empire would not just sit there in defeat, and they even tried several times to counterattack. However, they were crushed at every turn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Ultima&rsquo;s subordinates, Veyron, who did it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These two were, as one would expect, were ancient demons. They appeared to have an eye for the strong, and they chose the purely strong ones for the bloodbath, regardless of the classification of captains or ordinary soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their butler and cook uniforms were not suitable for the battlefield. However, they soon became a symbol of fear among the Imperial soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou was responsible for dealing with the enemy supply troops. He cut them down with a single stroke of his sword without mercy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Among them were those who tried to come forward&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it! I am the 97th rank&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou&rsquo;s white blade gleamed, and blood splashed in the air. And to his opponent who was about to break off, he spoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Forgive me. Rimuru-sama is watching this battle. Since he has ordered us to give it our all, I can&rsquo;t afford to take it easy on you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t intend for my words to be taken that way, but I understood that they had become a big deal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, having said that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m afraid that there&rsquo;s no way to retract my order now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I interfered, there would only be confusion on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, I decided to take a good look at the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a good thing that I did not interfere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In all honesty, the Imperial soldiers whom Veyron, Zonda, and Hakurou had killed were as good as or better than the Holy Knights. Moreover, their armaments were troublesome, and they were of a higher performance-legendary-grade than the &ldquo;spirit armaments&rdquo; that the Holy Knights wore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Overall, they were stronger than the Holy Knights. When I heard the result of Wisdom King Raphael-san&rsquo;s analysis, I was surprised as well. I wondered how they could have gotten such a large amount of equipment, but it couldn&rsquo;t be helped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guessed that these guys, who were given such equipment, must be the famous &ldquo;Imperial Guardians&rdquo; as they were rumored to be. As Gadra had told me, they were most likely the organization selected from the strongest of those in the empire, including the otherworlders. There were about a hundred members&hellip;I believe the pecking order was a proof of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If such powerful men had shown their abilities, the battlefield might have been more chaotic. Like Hakurou had done, it would have been the right choice to kill the opponent without waiting for them to be prepared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same was the case with Veyron and Zonda. They had taken the enemies out unnoticed before they could even make a move. They were able to recognize the strength of their opponents so easily, and they had a good eye to recognize the strong ones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would not have been so easy if the enemies had all assembled, but in this case, the ones at fault were those who had been careless on the battlefield. If there were any complaints, they should have given it their best from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same would apply for us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we had been too merciful on the enemy, we might have been caught by leaving an opening. If we had done so, the damage would have been enormous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such a foolish thing was unacceptable. Although it was tempting to show mercy, that was the same as underestimating your opponent just because you think you can win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were fighting in a war. It was a time to stay determined and do your best until the very end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the most important thing to consider was the declaration of surrender from the enemy&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">AAs I was admiring Hakurou and his team&rsquo;s fighting performance, something unusual happened at the Imperial Army&rsquo;s operation command center.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Notice. The ability Death Streak has been activated. The user is the individual named Testarossa.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hurriedly projected the scene on the big screen. There I could see Testarossa and Ultima standing there with smiles on their faces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were no other survivors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nearly a thousand tanks, which was the remaining strength of the army, had stopped moving, and the infantry deployed around them had all collapsed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The number of survivors was estimated to be in the tens of thousands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been called &ldquo;Death Streak&rdquo;, but I understood that it was a very dangerous magic.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Death Streak is a kind of &ldquo;nuclear magic&rdquo; that kills creatures by releasing a magical death ray. It also has a secondary effect of&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wisdom King Raphael-san was happy to analyze and explain it to me, but how could such dangerous magic be used?!&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help but want to call out. The nuclear explosion Ultima had used was called &ldquo;Nuclear Flame&rdquo;, but this was much more dangerous than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa may not have been the right one to fight them&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment this magic was activated, the battle was already won. There were no survivors in the enemy headquarters. It was only a matter of time before the remaining forces were eliminated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, the battle against the Imperial Army in the direction of the Dwarven Kingdom ended in a complete victory for our side.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

In the literal sense of the word&mdash;annihilated. The fact that this was not a military interpretation was truly frightening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought it was absurd. I never thought this would happen just because I told them to give it their all. Moreover, Benimaru had been scaring me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I mean, my plan was totally meaningless if it ended this way! What&rsquo;s with those intelligence officers?! I was told they were under Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s direct control&mdash;may I ask you to explain this to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was only keeping a few things a secret, but Benimaru turned around with a nice smile and said as such.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">W-Well&hellip;Um, you know&hellip; There wasn&rsquo;t much use for a plan, was there? But, Benimaru&hellip; You&rsquo;re not the only one who wants an explanation&mdash;I&rsquo;m the one who wants an explanation! I can&rsquo;t speak my mind&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I glanced at Veldora to ask for help. But he quickly averted his gaze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I knew that Veldora was particularly unreliable in such situations. The same could be said for Ramiris, who was not going to be able to help me right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-No, I told you, didn&rsquo;t I? I told you that they were new people that Diablo recruited and brought with him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I know that they are Diablo&rsquo;s subordinates.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that there was no more room for fooling around. There was nothing I could do, so I decided to tell the truth. Benimaru and Geld would accept it with a smile, even if they knew they were primordial entities. Besides, Diablo would be responsible for everything, so if any problem arose, we could just worry about that then. Armed with this theory, I decided to tell the truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, do you know what a primordial is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Primordial?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna, who was making me coffee, interrupted me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You mean the seven kings, the seven monarchs who were the origin of demons, right? I was curious to find out after listening to your conversation the other day. I was surprised to hear that Diablo-san was one of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t know that primordials, defined as the devils of the beginning, had such an exaggerated name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or rather, Shuna was telling such an important secret, but her face was still all calm and smiling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tense atmosphere in the Control Room was eased by the aroma of coffee in the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um&hellip;?&rdquo; Benimaru muttered in confusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, you didn&rsquo;t know about this, did you? Not only Diablo-san, but also Testarossa-san, Carrera-san, and Ultima-chan are the kings of demons, it seems.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is&hellip;Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna&rsquo;s smile was dazzling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru, too, seemed to be unable to ask any more questions in the face of Shuna&rsquo;s smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Benimaru&rsquo;s silence at my side, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think to myself, Shuna was actually quite a big deal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had prepared myself to tell everyone such a terrible secret, but it was revealed to them so easily that I was left slightly disappointed. Even so, it made me feel a bit better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Diablo, please explain it to me from your own mouth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Benimaru-dono. As you have just been informed, I am one of the primordials.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sipped my coffee while listening to Diablo&rsquo;s explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mmmm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tea was good, but coffee was very delicious too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. So that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s so strong. In that case, I wish you had told me about it from the beginning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, no, I thought you&rsquo;d be scared if you knew. I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s me or Veldora, but I didn&rsquo;t want Benimaru and the others to have to worry about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wanted to emphasize that I kept quiet because I was worried about my friends. As for the other things like giving them bodies and names&mdash;none of that mattered right now so there was no need to get into it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t afraid either!&rdquo; Even Ramiris insisted. I hoped they didn&rsquo;t feel fear more than necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it was a needless worry. As long as Rimuru-sama approves of them, we will accept anyone as our friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm. Benimaru-dono is correct. There is no one among us who discriminates against others based on appearance or strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru laughed, while Geld looked quite natural. They blew away my worries just like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna, too, didn&rsquo;t seem to have any issues toward Diablo and the others. The fact that they were treating each other normally as before was the proof of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that. I felt like I was losing my mind worrying about them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, you should trust us more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I can only thank Rimuru-sama for being so concerned about us and for deploying Carrera-dono and the others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a bit embarrassing, but I am glad Benimaru and Geld accepted them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now what about Gabil and Gobta?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As far as I could tell, they were doing well. Let&rsquo;s hope they would continue to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I can get along with Diablo just fine, so I&rsquo;m sure things will be all right!&rdquo; Shion assured me that she was not worried about them from the very beginning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean by that, Shion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It means exactly what it sounds like, Diablo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first secretary (Shion) and second secretary (Diablo) began to glare at each other. The word &ldquo;primordial&rdquo; seemed so serious, but in reality it was something like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was reassured once again that I had been worrying too much.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that the briefing was over, it was time to begin the review meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought it would be bad if the enemy&rsquo;s army had demon lord class soldiers, so I deployed Testarossa and the others, but they seemed to be trying a little too hard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though that was my fault, even I didn&rsquo;t think they would go on such a rampage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Should I say that they were messing around too much, or that they overdid it? Those guys are too cold. They annihilated the enemy army without any hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu&rdquo;&hellip;they were a bit overzealous, weren&rsquo;t they? I&rsquo;ll make sure to educate them later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo said as such with a smile, I didn&rsquo;t forget to tell him to &ldquo;Do it in moderation!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyway, I would leave the rest to Diablo. I&rsquo;m sure he could teach them not to overdo things in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next on the list was to check the damages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Less than two hours had passed since the start of the battle, and all the fighting is over. It seemed that many people were injured, but what was the overall damage?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As for the current situation, all of the injured have recovered!&rdquo; A cheerful voice echoed in the Control Room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The monsters who had gone out to the battlefield were given high potions made in our country. Ten for each of them. Thanks to these potions, most of the wounds were healed immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as for those who I had initially thought were dead&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, they were only pretending to be dead, and their limbs were completely healed by the effects of the full potion. Under Benimaru&rsquo;s leadership, they had successfully fulfilled their role as decoys.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you, didn&rsquo;t I? Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. Of course I believe in you and everyone else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything went according to Benimaru&rsquo;s plan. The only thing he did not expect was the overwhelming success of Testarossa and her team.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, although we had used a lot of recovery medicine, there were zero casualties. It was an unbelievably great victory. However, that did not mean that there was no damage at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just look at Gabil and his Hiryuu crew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They appeared to have suffered a lot of physical damage by using their Intrinsic Skill &lsquo;Dragon Body&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I originally thought that effect was so great it was fine, but as expected, the disadvantage was not only the time limitation. As soon as the battle was over, the reaction to the exertion came, and it seems that their entire bodies became paralyzed, and they could not move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because it wasn&rsquo;t an injury, the recovery medicine had no effect. Since they had built up their strong bodies by taking in the surrounding magicules, they must have had some kind of rejection reaction to the foreign substances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, the penalty of Gabil&rsquo;s arrogance was not only for Gabil but for the entire Hiryuu group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought that I should make him reflect on the fact that he was lucky to have gotten off with such a small penalty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, it seemed that this situation would last for about 24 hours, so we concluded that the move could only be activated once every two days at most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a good thing that they had won this time, but if they had used the ability wrongly, they could have gotten themselves killed. I told them to be careful with this double-edged sword more in the future.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

The &lsquo;Magic Tank Division&rsquo; led by Lieutenant General Gaster had 200,000 men. The &lsquo;Air Assault Division&rsquo; led by Major General Farage had 400,000 men. This was the Imperialist strength, as confirmed by Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were no prisoners of war because they were all dead. The total amounted to about 240,000 people&hellip; It was a total massacre.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not without a certain amount of heartache. But I already killed 20,000 of them with my own hands when I became demon lord, so I had no excuse now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At any rate, after killing about 240,000 of the imperial army, it seems that many sacrificed souls have entered my body. A short while after the battle, I felt my soul accumulating them at a furious pace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess this sensation was what was called &ldquo;collecting souls&rdquo; from my subordinates. Thanks to this sensation, I could grasp the exact number of enemy soldiers I had defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even so, I had acquired such a large number of human souls&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took only 10,000 sacrifices to evolve from a Demon Lord Seed to a &ldquo;True Demon Lord.&rdquo; So what would happen now that I took about 240,000 people?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The answer was, no change!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once I awakened as a &ldquo;True Demon Lord&rdquo;, it meant that my evolution had reached its limit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it wasn&rsquo;t for that, Guy probably would have killed and reaped the souls of the human race to the point of extinction by now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was because he had intuitively realized that he would not evolve any further that he was holding off on useless killings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then came an unexpected report.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;The number of souls acquired has exceeded the required number. At this moment, it is possible to awaken the members of the &ldquo;soul lineage&rdquo;. The subordinates include&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Wisdom King Raphael-san began saying something outrageous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apparently, it was possible to awaken a qualified person by giving him or her a certain amount of souls. A large amount of souls, which was thought to be meaningless, could be used for the evolution of subordinates, even if it did not affect my own evolution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raphael-san said that some of my subordinates had fulfilled the conditions to be able to awaken. By giving them the souls I had acquired, they would be awakened and become as strong as a &ldquo;True Demon Lord&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The number of souls required was 100,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I never thought that it would take ten times as many souls to awaken my subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess no one had ever heard of this before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guy and others may know it&hellip;but I wonder?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if they knew about it, they couldn&rsquo;t do it so easily. It would be cheaper to join those who had already become demon lords and lead them to awakening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That might be why Guy held meetings like Walpurgis that included the top ranks, all in order to select those who were worthy of joining the group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There may be other reasons than that, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t rule out the possibility that I was just being paranoid but there was no way of knowing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the very least, 100,000 souls was not a small thing. It wasn&rsquo;t something that could be done casually since it would be like killing an entire city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyway&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As of now, I had about 250,000 extra souls in me. With this, I could awaken two people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The twelve subordinates who could be awakened were are Ranga, Benimaru, Shion, Gabil, Geld, Diablo, Testarossa, Ultima, Carrera, Kumara, Zegion, and Adalmann.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Do you want to create a &ldquo;Soul Corridor&rdquo; to evolve your subordinates? YES/NO&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I understood from Wisdom King Raphael-san&rsquo;s words that it was possible to evolve them even if we were separated from each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like Veldora, if we were connected through the &ldquo;Soul Corridor&rdquo;, we would not be affected by time and space. It was not a bad idea, since it had the merit of strengthening the bond between me and my friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now then, what should I do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In my case, I had awakened and become much stronger than before. And my Unique Skill &lsquo;Great Sage&rsquo; had evolved into Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Benimaru and his friends could evolve too, there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any reason to hesitate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was curious about the term &ldquo;soul lineage&rdquo;. Perhaps this was a reference to the connection of souls through &ldquo;naming&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naming evolved monster. Although I didn&rsquo;t mind abusing it, I understood that this was a very dangerous thing to do. Wisdom King Raphael-san was the reason why I could do &ldquo;Naming&rdquo; with peace of mind&mdash;It knew what the safety margin was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If naming failed, there was a possibility that one could lose all their power and die. Even if not, it was said that one might be weakened without recovering their power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In my case, I had a useful Skill like the &lsquo;Stomach&rsquo; of Gluttonous King Beelzebuth, so I could keep the extra magicules. If I needed more, I could borrow them from Veldora, and I could leave everything else to Wisdom King Raphael-san. It was a cheat, to put it simply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Generally speaking, not everyone could do &ldquo;Naming&rdquo; easily, because they needed to use their own magicules. The same was true even for Guy. That was why so few people had subordinates whose souls were connected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those subordinates were irreplaceable to me. I, for one, was not going to use them as test subjects. Wisdom King Raphael-san recommended it, so I didn&rsquo;t think there was any danger. At least, that&rsquo;s what I wanted to think. But I had a feeling that it was still dangerous. Besides, I was not sure who I should choose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were many other problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the amount of magicules was the criterion, then Souei should also be qualified. However, the fact that Souei had not been chosen made me wonder about the condition of awakening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was also unclear what was going to happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the Harvest Festival for a demon lord, there was a dormancy leading to evolution as a rite of passage (initiation). Since there was no guarantee that this would not happen again, it seemed to me that we should take all possible precautions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Above all, the war was not over yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The main body of the Imperial Army&mdash;a total of 700,000 troops&mdash;was invading our capital city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be better not to take risks in this emergency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, my answer was no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would leave this matter until things settled down.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I hoped they would take the time to recover.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, I wanted the Blue Numbers to join Gobta and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru instructed them not to rush back to Gobta&rsquo;s side, since they would not make it in time for the battle if they returned now anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Incidentally, Gazel also asked for reinforcements, to which I replied that there was no problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel and his men were still in the middle of the war. The battle in the central region had ended, but there were still imperial forces deployed in the eastern region adjacent to the empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The number of troops was 60,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra said that this was a diversion by Yuuki&rsquo;s troops&hellip;But we could never be too careful when we didn&rsquo;t know how the situation would turn out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel and the others would take care of things&mdash;or rather, this was something I didn&rsquo;t need to tell them, and I&rsquo;m sure they would handle things thoroughly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We would be the ones responsible for the main body of the Imperial Guard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the consensus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the meantime&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although we had won the last battle, the enemy still had a large force that we couldn&rsquo;t afford to take lightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were enormously outnumbered and outgunned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though we were at a disadvantage, all the subordinates were highly motivated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Shion, for example, was full of enthusiasm and had said, </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;Those demons, how dare they stand out by themselves! I must go there and show them what true strength is!&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">She was saying that in frustration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Who the hell are you trying to fight against?&rsquo;&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help but want to spout off like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be my bodyguard?&rdquo;&mdash;She seemed to regain her reason in a hurry when I pointed that out. I couldn&rsquo;t help but think that it was better not to be too eager to fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion was not the only one who was full of motivation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milord! Ultima came to show off. I heard you won the first battle by a landslide! Ahh, I can&rsquo;t wait to get my turn. Is it okay to go out and give my greetings now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera, who had just burst into the Control Room, exclaimed with a flush on her cheeks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had been ordered to stand by with the Second Corps&hellip;Oh, so she had been communicating with Ultima and the others via &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems that they were very proud of their exploits and I can&rsquo;t stand it any longer&hellip;but I&rsquo;m troubled by the fact that I&rsquo;d be acting without permission.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Give your greetings?&rdquo; Benimaru asked back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though he knew that Carrera was a primordial, his attitude had not changed. I guess I had been too worried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes. I thought I&rsquo;d give them a little nuclear magic as a present.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t believe she said such a ridiculous remark with such a cute smile! The Yellow Primordial&hellip;what a crazy person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rejected!&rdquo; Benimaru replied with a dumbfounded look.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Carrera-dono. I&rsquo;m going to ask you to be patient until you get the order. Your actions will be meaningful only if you work when the time is right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera seemed to be disgruntled, but she did not seem to have any intention to disobey Benimaru&rsquo;s order. She nodded her head reluctantly after being rebuked by Geld.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right. I just wanted to show you my performance, but I need to wait for an effective time, don&rsquo;t I? I&rsquo;ll be quiet and wait for the right time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thank God that she agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seemed to listen to Geld&rsquo;s words, and they turned out to be a better duo than I had expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, Carrera. Rioting is not the only way to be active, is it? It is only when we become the sword of our lord that we can shine!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand, Shion-san. I&rsquo;ll try to cool down and be calm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You of all people are saying that?!&mdash;</span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s what I thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words themselves sounded good, but the thought that it was Shion who saying it made me feel unconvinced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mean, up until now, wasn&rsquo;t she the most violent person in the room?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was about to complain to Shion, but decided going to hold back. It would be a bad idea to rehash a story that had already been settled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I watched Carrera leave, I looked at Shion with a stern gaze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, it was enough to have fighting spirit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The forces here included the labyrinthine forces and the Second Corps, which was still in reserve. It seems that not only the top brass but also the smallest of the soldiers were working hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps because they had heard my words, they were all in high spirits, ready to give it their all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Against them, the Empire had 700,000 soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We may not be able to match them in numbers, but quality was more important than quantity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &nbsp;enemy may have their own strongmen hiding in the labyrinth, but we had another trump card: the labyrinth itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The key to victory is in the labyrinth. Veldora and Ramiris!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. Just leave it to us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about. I&rsquo;m here, so you won&rsquo;t have to worry about fighting anyone!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing such a powerful response made me feel better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most important thing was how to avoid making any sacrifices. The best way to do so would be to lure the enemy into the labyrinth. In the labyrinth, we could reduce the losses in our army to zero. Not only that, but we could also add the monsters in the labyrinth to our forces, and that would make up for our disadvantage in numbers all at once. If we included even the low-ranking monsters, the number of monsters in the labyrinth would be several hundred thousand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The only question now is how much the empire will trust Yuuki&rsquo;s words.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the other way around, don&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s precisely because he is an untrustworthy guy that he was able to make you doubt him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, that makes a lot of sense!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki had been a very troublesome presence if we looked at him as an enemy. Although we were now in a temporary relationship of mutual combat, he was not a trustworthy man to be considered as an ally. This feeling may be the same for the imperial side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s safer to have such a shady character hiding among the enemies rather than to fight with him as an ally, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion said it unusually well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because we don&rsquo;t have to worry about being betrayed, that we won&rsquo;t have to put in the extra effort.&rdquo; Benimaru nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;On the other hand, the imperial side may not consider Yuuki as their ally completely. They will be wary of Yuuki and doubt his words. This means that the 60,000 troops in front of the eastern city of Dwargon will not be able to move. The Empire may send troops there to clean up the mess, and we should tell Gazel to be very careful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s King Gazel, we should have nothing to worry about in that regard. But there is nothing worse than an untrustworthy ally. If it was me, I would have gone over and disposed of them first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">King Gazel had been informed about Yuuki. As Benimaru said, I was sure that the countermeasures would be taken without me having to worry. What we should be worried about was the main body of the Imperial Army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Currently, they were surrounding us from many directions. Since there was only a huge gate left on the ground, there was no need to panic, but I still couldn&rsquo;t help but feel nervous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thing that worried me the most was that they would ignore Tempest and attack the new kingdom established by Youm&mdash;Farmenas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had Razen and Grucius, but they did not have the strength for a large-scale war. We were in the process of reforming the kingdom by providing aid, and I did not want that place to become a battlefield at this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, if that happened, we would have to come to their aid, which would complicate the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although I was relieved that it did not happen at this point, we could not let our guard down yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the empire did not trust Yuuki&rsquo;s words and headed toward the Kingdom of Blumund, then&hellip; Geld and his men would attack from behind the Imperial army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if I was planning to send the entire Second Corps in with my Transfer technique&hellip;there would still be a ground war. The reinforcements from the labyrinth would be greatly reduced, so it would be expected to be a tough battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we recruited volunteers in the labyrinth, we would be able to gather a decent number. Even so, however, we could not take out the monsters that did not possess a will, so the number would be reduced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the first place, if the battle was fought on the ground, we would not be able to take advantage of the labyrinth, and we would have to be prepared for a great deal of damage. The ideal situation would be for the enemy to aim for the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Benimaru&rsquo;s strategy, the &lsquo;labyrinth siege,&rsquo; had the highest success rate and safety rate by far.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it came to a ground battle, the advantageous condition in the labyrinth would be lost. The fighters would have to fight each other head-on, under the same conditions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only natural, but in war, the key to victory would be how we could create a favorable situation for ourselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I personally thought the labyrinth was a bit unfair, but winning was justice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, hopefully, the labyrinth would be the main battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if the battle was on the ground, the basic policy would remain the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The primary goal would be to find out the strongman on the enemy side. Just as Gobta and the others were used as decoys in the previous battle, Geld and the others would be doing the job this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the common objective underlying Benimaru&rsquo;s plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All for the sake to protect me as the king&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt that Benimaru and the others were putting me first as much as&mdash;or even more so&mdash;than I was for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hoped they wouldn&rsquo;t force themselves too much, but Benimaru knew better than me, who was an amateur in the field of battle tactics. Even in the battle just now, the damage suffered was minimal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Benimaru was in charge of everything, all I had to do was remain firm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition to that, I would continue to make efforts in a quiet way so that people would feel more secure in relying on me.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I was a little worried that they might think it was a trap, but it turned out to be a groundless fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t know if my wish was granted, but as it turned out, things happened just as I had hoped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Enemy troops are deployed in front of the main gate on the ground!&rdquo; The operator reported.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the big screen, I could see the Imperial Guard soldiers lined up in an orderly fashion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The information obtained from the &ldquo;Argus&rdquo; was correct, but Souei&rsquo;s people were also monitoring the scene, so there was no need to worry about being misled by hallucinations or the like. It seemed to me that the Imperial Guard had taken the bait.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had no intention to hide their presence here, and all of their 700,000 troops were clearly visible. They may have been trying to intimidate us, but it was pointless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We had no intention of surrendering. We may run away, but we would never surrender to the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, the situation was the most ideal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve won.&rdquo; I muttered to myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. We&rsquo;ve won.&rdquo; Benimaru answered flippantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, at this point, we had already won the tactical victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We would take no damage inside the labyrinth, so as long as we took our time, we were sure to win. As long as there was no one stronger than a demon lord, that advantage would not be overturned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing that a greedy fool was drawn to the labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. Originally, I was going to say that Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s bait was too obvious, but I&rsquo;m glad to see they took it well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yeah. It looks like Gadra did a good job.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The enemy forces were now showing their full strength to us. If they had been dispersed, we would have been left wondering where the strong ones were hiding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dividing the forces was essentially a foolish idea, but in this case, it would be a great help if they were all united. Since they were going to invade the labyrinth one after another, the only question was how much strength they would leave on the ground&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In any case, it would be a bad strategic move for the Empire to pass through our country. It would be troublesome for us if they continued to block the ground gate and headed for the west&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, of course. If they leave 100,000 out of 700,000, that&rsquo;s enough to encircle us well enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, if the rest of them headed for the Western Nations, they would be able to cut off their worries about the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Incidentally, if that had happened, it would have been possible to enter and exit from other places. However, the entrance and exit to the places sealed by the spatial fixation system &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; was not opened, and the gate was only opened to the places where we had been to some extent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a realistic possibility, if we could unseal the entrance/exit of &ldquo;Dwelling of the Spirits&rdquo;, Ramiris&rsquo; old home, we would be able to enter/exit from there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, we would be trapped in the labyrinth. We would have been forced to go out of the labyrinth, because we would have been forced to watch the Western Nations being overrun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, it would result in a ground war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be a battle that could not be avoided in the end, but we would want to reduce the enemy&rsquo;s strength as much as possible before that time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t we have to warn the people on the ground?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If we provoked them to anger, wouldn&rsquo;t they get angry and throw their forces into the fray?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora and Ramiris had expressed such opinions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Those comments are worth listening to, but I don&rsquo;t want to warn them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? What&rsquo;s the reason?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know it Ramiris, don&rsquo;t you? There are &lsquo;words&rsquo; on the gate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah! Yes, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a matter of fact, I had inscribed a message on the great gate on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c12">The Weak Shall Not Enter</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wondered what the reaction would be?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to know how they will react when they see it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If it were me, I&rsquo;d be pissed off and rush in. It&rsquo;s just that I might let some men go down first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru might actually do that. He was the type of guy who would go in even if he knew it was a trap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t care. Because I&rsquo;m strong!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, yes. Once again, I wasn&rsquo;t asking Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think if it were me&hellip; If Beretta insists on going, I would have no choice but to go with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris&hellip; If you&rsquo;re afraid, then just don&rsquo;t go. Beretta was smiling at the mention of their name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s mercy, so any fool who ignores his warnings shouldn&rsquo;t complain about whatever happens to them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wondered why he looked so happy, but Diablo was right. This was a warning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But those cowards who can&rsquo;t even pass through the gate have no right to be on the battlefield in the first place. We must destroy them without mercy and make them understand the folly of opposing Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Excuse me, Shion-san. If you put it that way, we&rsquo;ll only end up fighting, won&rsquo;t we? Even Geld was laughing. Please think a little more about what you are saying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the other members of the executive committee were all thinking similarly to her. They were really motivated and very excited, saying that they were going to dedicate even more victories to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa and the others had gathered souls and offered them to me, and now that they were aware of it, they seemed to be trying to imitate them for some reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that Testarossa&mdash;or rather, the demons, liked to eat the emotional residue stuck in our souls. There were many ways to eat them, Testarossa ha said, but she loved to see their faces scrunched up in fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her smile was a little scary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I might have been scared before my reincarnation, but now I was satisfied with the way things were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s how it was for the demons, what about the other monsters?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They didn&rsquo;t know what they could do just by collecting souls, did they? I mean, I just found out about it just now, so I was wondering why they were even competing with each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe it was for something like a trophy, but I didn&rsquo;t really want it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even so, 700,000 people&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I really did get all of those souls, I would be able to awaken an additional seven members&mdash;It was a little scary that I was naturally thinking of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, no, no&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would have to be very careful not to turn into a monster in my heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With renewed determination, I turned my eyes to the big screen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re starting to move.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The image on the screen showed that of the imperial generals moving in a formation. They were moving into the gate without a trace of fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just as planned. If more than half of them rush in, the rest will be much easier&hellip;&rdquo; I muttered to myself, and Benimaru smiled wryly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to let any of them escape. I&rsquo;ll come with you if the situation calls for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My Second Corps has about 17,000 men. We may be outnumbered, but we&rsquo;re as strong as ever. I will change the terrain and show you just how we can contain the enemy forces.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we can count on you. If I burn their insides out with my fire, the rest of them should be strong enough to put up a fight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Carrera-dono will help us with that. She has been eager to go on a rampage for a while now, and I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll be happy to show us what she&rsquo;s got.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The power of the primordials is unquestionable. But I won&rsquo;t lose to her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This conversation was not what I expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru and Geld were talking as if they were easily going to win. I was a little worried about them too, but they were very bold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, they had Carrera with them, so I didn&rsquo;t feel any fear or hesitation when it came to the primordial.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru, that&rsquo;s not fair. If it&rsquo;s a war of extermination, it&rsquo;s my turn!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Shion came forward in the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess she forgot that she&rsquo;s my bodyguard again, but the Control Room was the safest place. Shion&rsquo;s &ldquo;Yomigaeri&rdquo; were a unit whose strength was their tenacity and endurance. I had been thinking of letting them play an active role in the event of a ground war, because it would be a waste to leave them idle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Shion wanted it, I could order them to go out&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calm down Shion. We need to find out what the enemy will do first. Depending on the situation, I may need you to come out as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyway, I appeased her by saying that for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, if you want to protect Rimuru-sama, I am enough on my own.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo said the same thing, and if push came to shove, we could even call back Testarossa and the others. They were teleportable and could get here in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Rimuru-sama says so, then it&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ll ask you to go out then, Shion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm! You can count on me, Benimaru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion had a big smile on her face and thanked Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why this girl liked fighting so much is a little beyond me. Well, since she was happy, I guess it was all right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, Rimuru, I&rsquo;m going to get ready!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming too! I&rsquo;ll show you the terror of the labyrinth!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. You can rest assured that I will be your last defense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, Rimuru-sama, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora and Ramiris left the Control Room in high spirits. Beretta followed them, and the Control Room returned to silence.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Veldora&rsquo;s point of view, this was his first job as a labyrinth master.

In addition, the &lsquo;Air Assault Division&rsquo; had deployed a hundred airships so that they could repel the evil dragon Veldora even if he appeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was also the &lsquo;Air Assault Division&rsquo;s&rsquo; job to carry the &lsquo;Magic Beast Corps&rsquo; led by Gladium to the west. However, they were to fly over the sea, which guaranteed a safe journey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Deciding that the airship would not need the strength, Calgurio was only responsible for logistics support. It was decided that the role would be completed by operating the 300 airships at full capacity and transporting munitions at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, they were concentrating their forces for the war against Veldora. The hundred airships dispatched to the Great Jura Forest were fully prepared with the most elite wizards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With this, they were now in full support, and it was believed that this force alone would be enough to conquer the entire west side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Gladium and his allies attacked the capital of Ingracia, the war would be over in no time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this two-sided simultaneous operation, Calgurio&rsquo;s Armored Corps would play a major role. That is to say, if they succeeded, they would be able to accomplish a great deal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This would increase his power in the empire. Calgurio could not stop laughing at the thought of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The outline of this operation was as follows:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as the enemy had taken a bite out of the &lsquo;Magic Tank Division&rsquo;, which had been conspicuously invaded, Calgurio&rsquo;s own main force would make its grand entrance. They would attack the stronghold of Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to the preliminary information, the city controlled by the demon lord could be isolated into a labyrinth. It might sound absurd, but it was the reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only thing left on the ground was the great gate leading to the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That being the case, all they had to do was surround it and make it inescapable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they sealed off the surrounding space with a magic canceler, they could also seal off the magic of transference. It might even be possible to seal it completely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only problem was the strength of Armed Nation of Dwargon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hero King Gazel was not to be underestimated, and dwarven soldiers were famous for their strength. Their undefeated record for a thousand years was not an exaggeration, and if they underestimate them, they would be in for a world of pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There is no way we can be defeated. With 2,000 magic tanks, even if we bring out the antiques of the old generation, they won&rsquo;t be able to match us at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The neutrality of the Armed Nation of Dwargon was of no concern to the Empire. They were just overlooked because they were a nuisance, and since they could win, there was no need to be shy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Magic and science.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fusion of these two things created the most powerful army, with a whole new way of fighting as a foundation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the Armored Corps led by Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel was indeed a champion, but he could not do anything alone. Of course, it was common sense that the quality of the army affected the war situation more than the quantity, but for Calgurio who knew the destructive power of tank guns, fighting with swords and magic was just an outdated method of warfare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those dwarves who could only prepare outdated and old-fashioned weapons would not be able to grasp the true value of the legions of the new age. By the time they realized it, it would already be too late. Only a one-sided invasion awaited them.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio had no way of knowing at the time that he was fundamentally wrong. The happy Calgurio was so sure of his victory that he had never imagined that he would be defeated.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just now, the long-awaited report came in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Negotiations had broken down. They had now entered into a state of war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio and his men marched as planned and took control of the current situation, the supposed stronghold of Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio, poised and composed, began to think of his men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It may have been a waste to give Gazel&rsquo;s head to Gaster, but if I don&rsquo;t give them candy, they won&rsquo;t follow me. I guess it can&rsquo;t be helped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lt. General Gaster and Major General Farage were among the best of Calgurio&rsquo;s men. He had no doubt that they would meet his expectations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though Gaster and Farage are dead at this point, it was too much for Calgurio to detect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, have you heard from Gaster yet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes sir! We haven&rsquo;t heard from Lieutenant General Gaster since the first report that they have engaged in battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm. I think it&rsquo;s about time the situation was settled. It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re struggling here. Isn&rsquo;t he being too lazy about contacting us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m not sure&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Well then, how about Farage?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that Gaster was too excited to be on the battlefield for the first time in a while. Calgurio thought that Gaster was probably enthusiastic about the battle, with a big victory on the horizon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, he asked about Farage&rsquo;s situation. If it was Farage, he should be watching the battle from the sky. If so, he would be able to give an accurate report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the liaison officer in charge of Farage was not acting properly. He was sweating greasily and desperately trying to make contact with Farage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s good mood was dampened, and he became grumpy. His tone also contained some thorns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The intelligence officer, perhaps impatient, replied hurriedly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Major General Farage reported that he had encountered a monster that looks like Veldora! He said that he would give us a follow-up report as soon as he could confirm it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no further communication.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the first report, there had been no communication at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to the communication mage, the magicules of the Great Jura Forest was so dense that even communication waves were easily blocked. The magicules seemed to be dense, but there seemed to be a reason for this. This place was a forest created by their old enemy, Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, this was the land of a demon lord. There was no choice but to accept things as they were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio stopped thinking about it, reasoning that there was no use in worrying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he was in the middle of a battle, he would not be able to make a report. Besides, as the communication mage said, it was quite possible that the magicule concentration in the surrounding area would affect the &ldquo;Magic Communication&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if Veldora was on the battlefield now&hellip; Magic communication would be impossible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio immediately changed his mindset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph! Then we&rsquo;ll wait for good news. If they really encountered Veldora, it is not surprising that we have not heard from Gaster or Farage. In that case, we are not to be outdone. Let&rsquo;s attack the labyrinth as soon as possible!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio felt assured because Gaster and Farage had been given such a large force that he did not think they could be defeated. He dismissed the possibility of such a defeat, believing that it could never happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the contrary, he even considered things to be more convenient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that Farage had encountered Veldora, only the demon lord remained in the labyrinth. The Four Heavenly Kings under his command were also said to be troublesome, but they were no match for the elite of the &lsquo;Augmented Legion&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without any hesitation, Calgurio decided to concentrate on the labyrinth in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s location was in a cleared area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was so vast that a large city could completely fit in it. Near the center of the clearing, there stood a large gate that served as the entrance to the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Magical exploration had not revealed any traps or other harmful objects. There was only the great gate, which seemed to be waiting for Calgurio and the others to challenge it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio believed that the words inscribed on the gate&mdash;&ldquo;The weak shall not pass through these gates&rdquo;&mdash;were proof that he was not mistaken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">How dare they hide everything for fear of being plundered by us? You have the wits of a monster, don&rsquo;t you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fear of looting in the name of local procurement was a common thing in every country. As a matter of fact, it was a problem if food could not be procured. For the Imperial Army with a large army, it was sure to be a serious problem. Tactically, it was also recognized as an effective means.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But this is too easy!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio laughed at the shallow intelligence of the monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soldiers who had been strengthened by otherworldly science and magic were able to perform at full strength without eating or drinking for a week. A single piece of energy-balanced portable food could supply enough energy for a day&rsquo;s activity. Each soldier carried twenty of them, and their consumption to date had been as calculated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had already distributed the amount they consumed, and they were fully capable of continuing the war without depending on the food supply of this city. The small size and light weight of the portable food items made the logistics as simple as possible. Drinking water, the biggest problem, could be produced by magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was problem at all. The elite generals could operate in the labyrinth for twenty-seven days.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The enemy may have placed their hopes on the greatest weakness of military operations with a large army&mdash;the supply cutoff, but he had to say that they were na&iuml;ve in their thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do they think they&rsquo;ve won just because they cut off our supply line? That&rsquo;s foolish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio laughed mockingly, and one of his staff agreed with him. He was a man from a noble family who was trying to suck out the sweet opportunities from Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, Calgurio-sama&hellip; We shouldn&rsquo;t make them sound so pitiful. Demon Lord Rimuru made a mistake right from the start. He overlooked our glorious &lsquo;Augmented Legion&rsquo; and sent Veldora, his strongest hand, against the decoys. And before he realized it, they were surrounded by so many champions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other chiefs of staff followed suit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t blame him for thinking that. Even though they are decoys, they have a large force.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It is tempting to use maximum force, but I can understand that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio felt better after hearing the conversation among the chiefs of staff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph! He may talk like a demon lord, but that&rsquo;s all he is! They must be shrinking back in the depths of the labyrinth by now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio and the others ridiculed the demon lord&rsquo;s shallow thinking and were convinced of the success of this expedition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wahaha! You are right. All we have to do now is to drag the demon lord to Calgurio-sama and cut off his head. Then Calgurio-sama will be a champion demon lord killer!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The aristocratic chief of staff lifted up Calgurio with his words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Not bad&rsquo;, Calgurio thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, they needed to attack this labyrinth and build a foothold here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would build a military base and use the momentum to overrun the west.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he didn&rsquo;t do it soon, Gladium with his Magic Beast Corps would overrun the Western Nations from the north. He really wanted to get out of the Great Jura Forest before that happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there was no need to panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their accomplishments would certainly be diminished, but only slightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The long-cherished wish of the Empire&mdash;the defeat of the &ldquo;Storm Dragon&rdquo; Veldora&mdash;With such a great achievement, other feats would be insignificant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the head of the Demon Lord Rimuru was added to that list, Calgurio was sure to be chosen as the greatest contributor to the empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like Calgurio, the chiefs of staff did not seem to doubt their victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, they were a huge army of 700,000 men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking at the majesty of their army, no one could even think of defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s set up a &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; here and then make a camp. Then deploy troops one after another. Let&rsquo;s attack the labyrinth in earnest!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll proceed as scheduled.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No objections were raised. The situation was not so urgent that they had to go out of their way to cause discomfort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for the glory of marching into the West, they would let Gladium take them. That was the common understanding among those present.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For now, this was more important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were more interested in the treasures that could be gained in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their greed had won out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, it was a simple and clear plan to flood the labyrinth with a strategy of quantitative attacks, and to plunder the labyrinth by the roots. The fact that there was no opposition to this strategy was evidence that they were dazzled by their immediate profit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Confident of their victory, Calgurio&rsquo;s group was honest about their desires. They had no doubt that the share of the treasure obtained in the labyrinth would enrich their own pockets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the labyrinth siege began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And immediately following&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those poor, clueless people happily descended the stairs, never to be climbing back up them again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The labyrinth does not reject any visitors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if they did not follow the rules, it was all the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was just that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The safety locks had all been disengaged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What awaited them beyond that point was the true form of the labyrinth that no one had ever experienced before&mdash;the true hell of this world.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

It was a secret meeting room that even Rimuru did not know about. Gathered in this vast hall were the rulers of the labyrinth. Normally, these people would not gather here like this. The fact that all of them are now here in this room showed just how important this meeting was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta, Ramiris&rsquo;s errand boy, deputy, and agent, was at the head of the group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were also the Four dragon kings. The Fire Dragon Lord, Ice Dragon Lord, Wind Dragon Lord, and Earth Dragon Lord occupied the four sides of the hall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in the center of the hall, seated at a round table made of ebony, sat the others&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guardian of the 90th floor: &ldquo;Nine Head&rdquo; Kumara.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guardian of the 80th floor: &ldquo;Insect Kaiser&rdquo; Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Floor Boss of the 79th floor: &ldquo;Insect Queen&rdquo; Apito.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guardian of the 70th floor: &ldquo;Immortal King&rdquo; Adalmann.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard of the 70th floor: &ldquo;Death Paladin&rdquo; Albert.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These were the men known as Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were three others who were out of place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next to Adalmann was a sharp-eyed old man named Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the end of the table, Gozer and Mezer, the 50th floor Guardians, were participating in a small group, aware that they were out of place among the strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozer and Mezer usually thought they could beat any opponent. However, after witnessing the existence of the elite, they had long realized that there was a stark difference between them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So for now, they were sitting in an uncomfortable position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was another reason why Gozer and Mezer didn&rsquo;t dare be too unbridled. It was because those who had gathered here were always quarreling over who was the strongest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even now, there was a fierce clash of spirits, and the space felt heavy as if it was distorted by an unusual pressure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Gadra, who was supposed to be a newcomer, was taking part in the struggle with impunity. Seeing this, Gozer and Mezer realized what they amounted to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t win against real, crazy people,&rdquo; they thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was a great man because he made them, who had been fighting for a hundred years, think in that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta and the dragon kings did not join in the fight, but they also did not intend to stop it either. They were taking the attitude that each of them should do as they pleased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While this may not be the reason, the debate on who was the most powerful among the Elite Ten was getting more and more heated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The case of Adalmann who was directly praised by Rimuru and moved up the rank of the Elite Ten was still fresh in their memory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, everyone&rsquo;s spirits were on a high note.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each person believed that they could be more useful. The lower-level managers tended to feel this way because they did not have much to do. They wanted a chance to make a difference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra, a newcomer, was eager to be useful to his friend Adalmann. He thought that if he could make a prominent contribution here, his position would be secured in earnest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalmann was Adalmann, and was eager to fight for Rimuru even more than he was doing now, and hopefully, he could enhance his own position. Thus, the other Guardians were an eyesore. They were not enemies, but they were still an obstacle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Albert followed Adalmann. In addition, Albert had the ambition to make his name famous by enhancing his own military achievements. He was a surprisingly ambitious man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito and Kumara were both women, and they had a very bad relationship with each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara, in particular, guarded the depths of the 90th floor. Therefore, she was rarely seen in battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara was jealous of Apito&rsquo;s success against the Holy Knights. Therefore, she was very much opposed to her, and encouraged this out of a sense of rivalry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito was competitive and would not back down from a challenge from Kumara. Therefore, the two of them were always at odds with each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion was the top of the labyrinth, although he seemed to always keep his nose out of things. He was the one who remained the object of everyone&rsquo;s jealousy. He was involved in this conflict, whether he wanted to be or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, the relationship between the strongmen of the labyrinth was not very good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, if they were asked whether they truly hated each other, the truth was that they did not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, they just wanted to prove that they were the best, which was different from trying to kick the other person down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were jealous, but they also respected each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They fought, but that did not mean they hated their opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone thought of each other as rivals who were competing with one another in a friendly competition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that they were all gathered here, they were surprisingly quiet. Everyone&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the top of the round table, which remained empty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those spots belonged to Veldora, the king of the labyrinth, and Ramiris, the great creator of the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two hours had already passed since the meeting was called.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The noise had been loud until a just few minutes ago, but when Beretta appeared, everyone had quieted down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Veldora-sama and Ramiris-sama will visit us soon. We must be quiet and wait.&rdquo; With that said, Beretta took their seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;May I ask you a question, Chief?&rdquo; Kumara asked, and Beretta nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This time, are we gathered here because&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is as you have guessed. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss how to eliminate the fools who are invading this labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing this, everyone shut their mouths. They had heard about the current situation. Although they had not been told of the purpose of the meeting, they could practically guess the main points. That is why they had been checking on each other so intensely, but now that they were told that the imperial army had invaded the labyrinth, their hostility exceeded their competitive spirits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What would it mean to make an enemy of the labyrinth? In order to make sure those people understood that correctly, everyone&rsquo;s minds became united.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A heavy tension filled the room, and&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, guys!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yo, everyone. Thanks for coming!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris and Veldora appeared, and the excitement in the room increased dramatically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris, feeling great about such an atmosphere, spoke to everyone in a more serious tone than usual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Today we are facing an unprecedented crisis since the creation of this labyrinth! That&rsquo;s why, I want to hear everyone&rsquo;s thoughts!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that was the signal for the meeting to begin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara was the first to react.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? It&rsquo;s already been decided.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was about to express his thoughts as if she had been waiting for this very moment, but then Apito took her words away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just kill them all, I guess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara and Apito glared at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This time, you&rsquo;ll be giving us a turn on our own floors, won&rsquo;t you? After all, Apito has been happily playing with Holy Knight-san these days, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean? Hinata-sama is a good opponent, but the Holy Knight Order is too weak.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A different kind of tension began spreading through the venue. It was Veldora who calmed down the tension.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuahaha! Stop fighting, and be at ease. This time, everyone will have a chance to fight. From what I&rsquo;ve heard, the enemy beliefs that the deepest part of the labyrinth is the 60th floor. Despite our outward propaganda that the maze has a hundred levels, they don&rsquo;t believe it! Do people think it&rsquo;s okay for them to be so stupid?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No!</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;they all thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I had thought it would be fun to play along with it&hellip;But that seems like too much trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right! As the master just said, waiting for them to break through to the 50th floor would be very troublesome. Not only is it troublesome for us, but also for them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. There are 700,000 of them out there right now. Rimuru told me to lure as many as I could into the labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re all crammed at the entrance, it&rsquo;s going to take a long time, right? Plus, having too many enemies at once is also a problem. That&rsquo;s why, we decided to repeat the process from the beginning, sending a thousand men to each floor, and dividing the enemy army!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fortunately, the Imperial soldiers were all in order and behaved in a disciplined manner. They were entering the labyrinth smoothly by keeping their ranks in order, but still, it was only natural that it would take some time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the front line were to enter the labyrinth, the line of movement would be interrupted. Then, there was no telling how long it would take for everyone to enter the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you have good luck after drawing lots, there might be a strong opponent, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuahahaha! Perhaps one of them might even be the threat for Rimuru, whom Benimaru was looking for! Well, I personally think he&rsquo;s worrying too much, but it would be a big win if we could find them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At Ramiris&rsquo; and Veldora&rsquo;s words, the look in everyone&rsquo;s eyes changed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Four Heavenly Kings under Rimuru were the admiration of all those who were in charge of the labyrinth. Among them, Benimaru was Rimuru&rsquo;s confidant and best friend. He was considered the one whom the others wanted to challenge someday and see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;No, no, his best friend is me&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Veldora would have said. But since no one mentioned it out loud, the conversation went smoothly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that means&hellip;everyone has a chance, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, I have nothing to complain about.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Apito and Kumara instantly became reconciled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The others, too, were full of enthusiasm, with their own ambitions in mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, if anybody comes to our territory, we are free to do as we please?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing Adalmann ask that, Ramiris answered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; This was the decisive blow, and the labyrinthine group became even more serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris continued with her explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still getting more and more people coming in, but for now we&rsquo;re just throwing them in one by one, starting from the 41st floor. Once we get 1,000 people, we will move down one floor at a time, so please keep that in mind! I&rsquo;ll assign tasks and explain later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All the jealous eyes of those present focused on Gozer and Mezer at once, and both of them began trembling nervously. Their bodies shrank even more, trying their best to get through this situation. They both agreed that it would be much better to fight against those foolish intruders than to keep going through this right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Paying no mind to Gozer and the others, Ramiris&rsquo; explanation did not end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re just going to accept them all and scatter them to each floor. In the end, we&rsquo;ll have 100,000 of them going to the 41-50</span><span class="c5 c18">th</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;floors, 100,000 from the 51-60</span><span class="c5 c18">th</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;floors, 100,000 from the 61-70</span><span class="c5 c18">th</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;floors, 100,000 from the 71-80</span><span class="c5 c18">th</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;floors, and 100,000 from the 81-90</span><span class="c5 c18">th</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;floors. Then, each dragon king will take, probably 10,000 each? If more people come in, we&rsquo;ll divide them amongst the upper floors!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The maximum number of people accepted at one time would be 540,000. Ramiris said that she hoped to receive at least 350,000 as a minimum. Finally, she explained the most important matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that the rules of the labyrinth have been changed for this time only. Each dragon room has been enlarged ten times larger than usual, and the floors have all been replaced, so if someone breaks through the 90th floor, he or she will immediately enter the dragon room. But you see, this is not important. What really matters is that the conditions for clearing the rooms have changed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris emphasized this as she flapped around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So just what were the conditions for clearing the maze?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, this time, once one entered the gate, they were not allowed to leave unless they cleared the maze. Since clearing the maze meant defeating Veldora, the game was essentially an all-out battle. In addition, it was necessary to collect the ten keys held by Elite Ten as a condition to challenge Veldora. In other words, even those who started from the 80th floor would need to go back to the upper floors to defeat other Elite Ten and get all the keys.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing this, a look of satisfaction appeared on the faces of the Elite Ten. The dragon kings roared in all directions in the hall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, I guess we all have an equal opportunity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s a race to see who can kill the most prey.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then sparks began fly among them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh. I hope I have a worthy opponent to really swing my sword against.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too arrogant, Albert, we only have to think about destroying the enemies of our god.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then began a squabble between master and servant. Others also began meditating quietly. Everyone seemed to be in high spirits for the battle to come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Standing before the Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten, Beretta, who was considered to be the chief, opened their mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, Ramiris-sama, I&rsquo;ve been asking you for a while now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, that. Well, Rimuru has given his approval, so let&rsquo;s just see how it goes this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After exchanging some words with Ramiris, Beretta stood up and looked around at the Elite Ten.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gentlemen. I have been given the role of Dungeon Master by Ramiris-sama. I was also the head of the Elite Ten&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta personally believed that the position of the head of the Elite Ten was nothing more than a chore. Beretta was only included in the Elite Ten to make up the number of members, because ten members were needed for the sake of consistency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The names of his positions and titles were also changed quite frequently, perhaps reflecting Ramiris&rsquo;s loose character. The worst one was &ldquo;Ramiris&rsquo;s errand boy&rdquo;, which was, to say the least, unwanted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for his colleague, Treyni, she was valued by Ramiris even though they were in the same position. The reason for this was that she never scolded Ramiris. Beretta personally thought that this was too much. Treyni was still doing as she pleased. She seemed to have gotten Ramiris&rsquo; approval, and had gone off somewhere without Beretta&rsquo;s knowledge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta sighed secretly. In any case, they were now being called the head of the Elite Ten just to make up the numbers. Beretta was not happy about it, so they wanted to give the position in the Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten to someone else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that long-awaited opportunity had arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will give up my position to the one who performs well in this battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that moment, the Elite Ten&rsquo;s eyes all lit up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Gozer and Mezer began to harbor ambitions that were out of their league, thinking that perhaps they could join the Elite Ten. Unfortunately, these ambitions were put to rest by Beretta&rsquo;s following words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The role of an Elite Ten in this battle will be temporarily filled by Gadra-dono there. His ability is considerable, as Adalmann-dono recommended him, and his knowledge is so rich that not only myself, but even Ramiris-sama have approved of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra, who was suddenly named, was surprised but unfazed. He had not lived a long life for nothing and was accustomed to these kinds of situations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Here it comes! It&rsquo;s my time! If I can make a significant achievement here, the word &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; in my position will disappear!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was always aggressive. Otherwise, he would not have been able to move from one country to another like some wild horse. And Gadra was also aware of his place. With his accurate and discerning eyes, he had seen the strength of the Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten. Some of them were lower or even equal to him, but there were also some who were so strong that it would be absurd to compare himself to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be absolutely impossible for him to consider himself as the first place while ignoring such outliers. Knowing this very well, Gadra limited his goal to joining the Elite Ten.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will accept your offer with all my heart!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Will you accept? In that case, you&rsquo;ll be doing me a big favor, Gadra-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra and Beretta, this was the moment when a relationship of mutual interest was established. Thus, personnel changes were made, albeit tentatively, before the war against the Empire. Beretta then left the Elite Ten and Gadra became a member.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, yes! I&rsquo;m glad that Gadra-chan has taken the job. Gadra-chan is in charge of the 60th floors. I want you to use Demon Colossus, the boss over there, to the fullest!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The conversation continued smoothly. This was already discussed with Rimuru beforehand, and it was decided to let Gadra operate it on a trial basis. Since Gadra was usually helping Ramiris with his research, he agreed to it without any hesitation. In fact, from Gadra&rsquo;s point of view, the Demon Colossus was what he wanted to have.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm! In that case, we should give Gadra some kind of a second name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, about that, Gadra-chan, do you have any suggestions?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The newly dubbed Gadra-chan was at a loss to respond to such a question out of the blue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yes&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra thought that this was not what was important right now. The imperial army had already invaded, so they needed to get into a defensive position as soon as possible. He assumed that everyone was thinking that, even if they didn&rsquo;t say it out loud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it seemed that this was not much of an issue for the people at the top, and they kept their usual attitude even in such a situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s the way it should be. His Imperial Majesty Rudra was a great man, but these people are no less. Well, if it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Storm Dragon&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Fairy of the Labyrinth&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s only natural&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra admired this. Although Gadra was not a man of loyalty, he was in awe of Veldora and Ramiris nevertheless, and also of Rimuru who was able to use them so well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about the &lsquo;rune master&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Master, I think that sounds really cool!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right? As a man of my word&hellip; I&rsquo;m cool when I say that I&rsquo;m cool&mdash;kuahahaha!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra didn&rsquo;t dare have any objections to that. So that&rsquo;s how things came to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that the explanation was almost over, but Ramiris still had something to tell everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember now! Gozer and Mezer also have an important role to play!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozer and Mezer, who had been nervous about what role they would be assigned, jumped up when they heard this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So then, what kind of role will we be playing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, what will we have to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They asked fearfully. Ramiris, on the other hand, gave an order without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stay at the 30th floor and send the monster bosses there. And if any of the enemies escape, get rid of them. I&rsquo;ve also set the destination of the bracelet to the 30th floor, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about being killed by mistake! Good luck!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her tone of voice sounded as if this was a matter of course. Gozer and the others could only nod their heads. They were motivated, but more than that, they were anxious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they did not make a contribution here, they were afraid that they would be abandoned. If they did not fight well, they would be fired from this prestigious position. Gozer and Mezer looked at each other and nodded their heads in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The boss of the 30th floor was a B-plus ranked Ogre Lord along with his five subordinates. They obeyed the orders of Gozer and Mezer who were Over A rank, so they would be reliable companions for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, even Gadra, a newcomer to the rank of Elite Ten, agreed to take the place of the Elite Ten without any hesitation. Gozer and Mezer, who were the senior members of the Elite Ten, could not do anything bad here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was one more thing. Something else that they realized.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if someone could get through to the 30th floor, there was no escape for the Imperial Army. Even if they ran up to the top floor, the first floor, they would have no choice but to turn around again from there. In this sense, their work was very light in responsibility. And they realized that the more people lost, the more that could be killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this. We are Guardians too. If we get recognized for our achievements here, we&rsquo;ll become more prestigious!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right brother. This time we won&rsquo;t be stingy about petty things. Let&rsquo;s crush the enemy with everything we&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get rid of every last Imperial soldier that&rsquo;s escaped!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes! I&rsquo;ll make sure we live up to Ramiris-sama&rsquo;s expectations!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no choice but to step forward. In an instant, their anxiety vanished, and their motivation was ignited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, the division of roles was decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru has asked us to lure as many Imperial soldiers as possible into the labyrinth! To do so, you have to make them feel a certain amount of good about themselves!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who heard this all nodded their heads vigorously, as if it were a matter of course. Everyone understood his or her role. At least for the first day, they were supposed to quietly watch the enemy forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris, while watching them with satisfaction, dropped a final bomb.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right. Good luck everyone! By the way, Rimuru also said that he would be watching this battle, too. It&rsquo;s a chance for him to see what we&rsquo;ve been up to, not just to decide who will be the next head!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment Ramiris&rsquo; comment was heard, everyone&rsquo;s expression became serious to the point of being deadly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama will be watching us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Zegion, who had been keeping silence, spoke gravely. Apito was quite surprised at this, because Zegion, the &ldquo;Insect Kaiser,&rdquo; was a taciturn man who seldom ever spoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A man whose only interest was strength, aside from his loyalty to Demon Lord Rimuru&mdash;that was who Zegion was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, um, yeah. Rimuru said he would watch everything, too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris, who was unexpectedly overwhelmed, replied in a hushed tone. For Ramiris, it was a rare opportunity to see Zegion speak. It was natural for her to be surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Zegion. Ramiris&rsquo;s words do not lie. Rimuru was also intrigued about the strength of the labyrinthine forces. That is why he chose to believe in you all and entrusted you to play a major role in this battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora followed up Ramiris&rsquo; surprise and said as such. To Veldora, Zegion was an excellent apprentice whom he had trained in combat for some time now. He was even better than Charys, who had known Veldora for a long time. In fact, he had grown to the point that he could fight even with Veldora under certain conditions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion was too powerful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Except for Veldora, there was no one in the labyrinth who could fight against Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was precisely because of this that Zegion was so excited about this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. So Rimuru-sama has heard about our successes&hellip;it really gets my blood pumping. I will show him just how much I&rsquo;ve grown.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, of course! You said you were looking forward to it, so let&rsquo;s surprise everyone!&rdquo; Ramiris concluded with an innocent smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris may seem innocent and good, but she was ruthless at heart. She was still a demon lord, and she did not argue against the absolute rule of the law of survival of the fittest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once entering the labyrinth, everyone would be presented with the rules. Even the Imperial generals were not an exception to these rules. When confirming the &ldquo;will of the person to enter&rdquo;, each person would be asked whether it was OK if they were unable to leave the labyrinth unless they ha fulfilled the conditions for clearing the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Would it be taken as a threat or a warning&hellip;? Even if some of the enemies thought that they might be in trouble, no one would try to stop them. Everyone fantasized about the riches to be gained in the labyrinth and were sucked into the labyrinth like ants swarming around sugar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From that point on, Ramiris&rsquo; mercy would be no more. Therefore, she welcomed them as her enemies without any hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was then that the imperial generals would realize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They would witness true nature of this labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tasting nothing but fear&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We will claim victory. A victory dedicated to Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion muttered those worlds and rose from his seat.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px;"><img alt="" src="images/image23.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if on cue, everyone began to move out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the venue that had become an infernal hell, they awaited the arrival of their guests.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

They were lined up in neat rows, their movements sharp and methodical. Each soldier was equipped with a safety belt around their waist, and they were linked together so that they were spaced three meters apart, front and back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a separate combat team, which was not roped off and were allowed to move freely. When not engaged in battle, they held the lifelines that connected the soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The maze was nothing in the face of the sheer volume of the large army. They were well prepared, and no one could get lost in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satisfied with his skillful arrangement, Calgurio began thinking of the riches he would gain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This maze is nothing but child&rsquo;s play. The real problems are the monsters that live there&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was just not their strength that was the problem, but rather the time-consuming combat. According to their preliminary investigation, the lowest floor was the 60th level, but that was not certain either. There was even a rumor that there were up to a hundred floors, but that was deemed unrealistic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio thought it to be a bluff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The deeper floors yielded more valuable treasures. And above all, purer &ldquo;magic crystals&rdquo; would be recovered. It was very tempting, but it seemed that the strength of the monsters living in those areas also increased proportionally. Calgurio was worried about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Well, if we can find out what kind of monsters there are, we can find a proper way to deal with them. Then we will be able to hunt more efficiently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Stroking his proud beard, Calgurio came to his conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The labyrinth seemed less of a threat as he looked at their well-trained soldiers. Their majesty was a testament to their sheer power. They had been training specifically for the battle in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A spirit magician would check the paths of the soldiers, and the special operations team would disarm the traps. The combat team would eliminate the monsters, and the processing team would dismantle monsters and collect &ldquo;magic crystals&rdquo; from them. This sequence of events were arranged to be carried out at the head of each line.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The obtained treasures would then be sent to the back of the line via the soldiers who were connected to the line. Then, they would be handed over to the front entrance, and those who had been waiting for them would be asked to carry them to the operation command center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By linking soldiers together, they could respond to changes in any situation. The soldiers were carefully trained so that they would be able to bring back information immediately if something happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s plan had worked very well at first. However, something unusual began to happen. After about 1,000 people had entered the camp, they lost contact with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sir, what should we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What had happened to those soldiers? They still didn&rsquo;t know. The fact that the ropes had been cut cleanly indicated that the space had been distorted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">It was obtained from prior information that the structure of the labyrinth is sometimes transformed. But that was said to happen only once every 24 hours&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio was worried about it, but he did not let the line of soldiers stop invading. He allowed them to continue their advance for a while. As it turned out, the structure of the labyrinth was changing for every thousand people that entered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, that&rsquo;s not it.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Calgurio realized.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. The enemy seems to be welcoming us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;? What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious. It&rsquo;s not good for them if the labyrinth is overcrowded with people. That staircase doesn&rsquo;t lead down to the second level&hellip;but to another floor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? How can they do such a thing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio looked at the astonished staff member as if he were an idiot and snickered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s possible. The enemy is a demon lord, after all. If he couldn&rsquo;t do such a thing in his own lands, he would have been destroyed long ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Quite accurately, Calgurio predicted the events that were taking place in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Based on the soldiers&rsquo; conversation before they had lost contact with each other, there was no indication that anything unusual was happening. It was hard to believe that something had happened all of a sudden.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We lost contact with exactly 1,000 people. What do you make of that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see&hellip; I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re correct, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nodding his head, Calgurio began to consider.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this moment, some treasures were still coming in. Some were fine trinkets, and others were magisteel weapons and armor. All of them were first class. Moreover, the &ldquo;magic crystals&rdquo; collected were of high quality and the conversion efficiency to energy was impeccably high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the invasion was halted at this point, the lives of the 2,000 people who had been sent ahead of the invasion would be in danger. Instead, it would be more effective to push through with the invasion with the quantity of materials as originally planned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio decided as such.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is a threat. The enemy wants us to give up the labyrinth to buy time. That way they can expect reinforcements from Dwargon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous. By now, Dwargon has&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about. If we halt the operation at this point, we&rsquo;ll only be doing the enemy a great favor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, we will continue with the labyrinth siege!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio was satisfied that he had seen through the enemy&rsquo;s plan. He weighed the profits to be gained against the lives of his soldiers and decided to ignore the slight element of uncertainty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that moment, the fate of the Imperial Army had been decided.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A whole day had passed since the start of the raid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As they pushed on day and night, around 350,000 soldiers had entered the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As usual, the invasion point was changed every thousand people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that only those who had been sent to a certain floor could barely take parts of their bodies out of the labyrinth, and the kinds of treasures that could be obtained from them were changing. There were almost no low-quality treasures, including a slotted sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This weapon appeared to be a new weapon of the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The presence of this weapon showed them just how much the enemy was in a hurry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they had had the time, they would have recovered it. The fact that they had not done so was proof that they had no time to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Because they are trying to attract visitors to the labyrinth, they will only have themselves to blame when the time comes. How foolish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The idea of using a labyrinth to attract people from neighboring countries was interesting. However, Calgurio had to say that it was pointless if they were unable to respond to the situation at this critical moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this way, Calgurio mocked Demon Lord Rimuru and the others, as fools, and decided to watch the situation after a day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers in the command center took turns resting. He could have continued, but he suddenly felt uneasy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So far, 350,000 people have entered the labyrinth, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes! Half of our army has entered the labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s prediction was correct, although he almost lost contact with every thousand people. A few moments later, reports came in that the soldiers who had entered before had been found.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Imperial Army suddenly gained momentum. Everyone had been anxious, so they were relieved to know that their comrades were safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would have been a disgrace to the Imperial Army to be upset over something so trivial. Everyone thought so and had hidden their anxiety behind their actions. That was why they were energized by the good news. Now that they had nothing to fear, the speed of the invasion accelerated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The result was that as many as half of the soldiers had been swallowed up by the labyrinth&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that we&rsquo;ve put so many people into this labyrinth and still haven&rsquo;t filled it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I had no idea it was so vast.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sixty floors&hellip; I thought it was said that the lower you go, the smaller the floors get.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I heard. I thought we&rsquo;d be able to conquer it sooner&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to the schedule, the Imperial Guards should have conquered the labyrinth long ago. However, the reality was different. The moment the soldiers temporarily stopped the raid, they lost contact with those who were inside. Once the advance party was discovered, a considerable amount of treasure was transported. However, this was also cut off now that the raid had been halted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No one has come out yet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. It seems that in order to get out, they need to clear the labyrinth&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have heard about that. Apparently, each soldier is asked a question in their mind upon entering, correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. However, although the conditions are clear&hellip;it seems that before we can defeat the king of the labyrinth, we must defeat the guardians of the ten keys.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, so we haven&rsquo;t defeated them yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that was not what Calgurio wanted to know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The king of the labyrinth was probably referring to Demon Lord Rimuru. If the goal was to defeat Rimuru, then it was also what they themselves wanted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was how it should be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, in reality, the situation was such that they could not even make contact with the soldiers in the labyrinth, only able to halt the sending of the follow-up troops.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you think we can defeat Demon Lord Rimuru with a force of 350,000 men?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When asked this question, the staff officers stammered. However, they immediately answered in high spirits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The failure of the Kingdom of Farmus was due to the encounter with Veldora. With Demon Lord Rimuru alone, they should be enough to defeat him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree with you. There are many people of Over A rank participating, so we just have to wait for the good news.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps relieved by the agreement, the chiefs of staff shouted loudly that victory was assured. Nevertheless, Calgurio could not shake off his uneasiness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;First of all, let&rsquo;s make contact with those inside of the labyrinth. Send in a liaison team and have them try various means of communication.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under Calgurio&rsquo;s order, various methods were attempted to make contact. However, all of them failed. &ldquo;Magic Communication&rdquo; and &lsquo;telepathy net were attempted, but no response was received.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The staff officers found it difficult to keep fooling themselves any longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hearts that had been filled with excitement over the loot from the labyrinth were now sinking in the face of the uncertainty of what lied ahead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was all due to the fact that they could not make contact with anyone the inside of the labyrinth. Without knowing what was going on, the staff officers could not fulfill their roles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, we will continue to organize the troops and resume the invasion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio nodded with a &ldquo;Hm.&rdquo; Either way, they would have to send soldiers to check on the situation. Waiting on the ground, they had no way to see what is going on inside the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The entrance to the labyrinth, the Great Gate, remained wide open, just as it had been since the beginning. It was as if nothing had even happened. And yet, as soon as the following team lagged behind even a little bit, the presences of those in the labyrinth were immediately lost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The previously smooth flow of money and goods coming from the inside was also interrupted at the same time. Perhaps because of this, a heavy atmosphere began to hang over the operation command center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two more days passed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why is there no further news?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because every 1,000 people are sent to a different location, we may not be able to find the troops who have penetrated deep into the area.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, is the labyrinth really that vast?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re all gone&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You fool, are you a coward?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everybody, calm down. Perhaps this is Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s plan. He wants to make us doubt ourselves and give up on the labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, unlike in the beginning, only 1,000 people an hour were being carefully sent in. However, it had become difficult to bring back not only treasure but also any information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the first day alone, 350,000 people entered the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the second day, 150,000 people were sent in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the third day, only 30,000 people were sent in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The number of Imperial soldiers remaining on the ground was reduced to 170,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wiser to conserve our forces here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; It&rsquo;s tempting to play into the enemy&rsquo;s hands, but it would be a bad idea to reduce our forces any further.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve also sent supply troops into the labyrinth, so the limit of the generals&rsquo; activities has been extended. Shouldn&rsquo;t we wait at least 20 days to observe the situation&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being negative!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But we still haven&rsquo;t been able to contact Lieutenant General Gaster or Major General Farage. Are they still fighting the enemy or are they&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had sent intelligence teams to the area several times, but no one had returned. They had lost touch with their trusted allies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just because the concentration of magicules is too high. There is no other reason.&rdquo; Calgurio assured them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s comment was based on his judgment that further demoralization would be detrimental. However, it was difficult for him to dispel the disquieting atmosphere that filled the room. In that indescribable and eerie silence, every soldier of the Imperial Army felt a sense of foreboding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio was no exception.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">There were still 170,000 soldiers left on the ground. On the other hand, it could be said that there were </span><span class="c2">only</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;170,000 left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Perhaps I&rsquo;ve made a terrible mistake&hellip; </span><span class="c5">The</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">thought suddenly crossed Calgurio&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That towering gate. Now it looked to be very eerie, which only seemed to fuel Calgurio&rsquo;s uneasiness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What would be the fate of those who challenged the labyrinth through that gate&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wouldn&rsquo;t be long before Calgurio found out.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

The monsters that appeared there were strong, but they were still only B-rank or lower. They were no match for the reinforced soldiers, and the conquest of the labyrinth was progressing rapidly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers of the empire were very capable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In terms of adventurers rankings, all of them were at least C-plus rank with first-class skills. Because of this, they were able to cope with the monsters without panic as they appeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They marched in an orderly line. The battle team was escorting them with vigilance, lagging slightly behind the lead. They set up a stronghold at each corner and controlled the passage. Acting as they had been trained to do, they filled the floor. In less than a day, both the stairs going up and the stairs going down had been discovered. In this mission, the first step was to use all of their strength to take down the demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The treasure on the upper floors were to be taken by other units or after everything was finished. The staircase was taken over as a base of operations. Then, the invasion continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nearing the staircase, there was a room with a sealed door. The signboard on the door read &ldquo;Resting Place&rdquo;. It was just as they had expected, except that the door could not be opened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As I thought, the door does not open. It has been made inoperable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. Is there no way to destroy it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes! Both firearms and magic are ineffective. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just as difficult to destroy as the passageways in the labyrinth!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The captain nodded in agreement with the soldier&rsquo;s report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a natural result and not surprising.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It might be possible to destroy the labyrinth by bringing in a tank gun or by invoking large-scale magic. But that would not guarantee the safety of those inside. It was unimaginable how much damage would be caused if nuclear magic were to be invoked here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, the captain decided to challenge the labyrinth in a straightforward manner as originally planned. In other words, it was a mass operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, when he was told that the rest area was unavailable, he complied with the situation, though he was also annoyed about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Report to our superiors. Tell them that the invasion is going well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, he was upset when only 1,000 people were left. However, it would be a disgrace for him as an Imperial general to be discouraged by such a situation. The commander decided to continue with the invasion. It was the right decision. After a while, they were able to meet up with another unit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The floor was much larger than they had expected, but thanks to the cooperation between the Spirit users and the surveyors, they were able to successfully conquer the floor. The &ldquo;magic crystals&rdquo; dropped from the defeated monsters were also of high quality, and the treasure chests they found yielded some wonderful treasures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who descended the stairs reported that they were close to conquering the 42nd floor. There were loud cheers at that time because the imperial army had not been defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the second day, the search of all the rooms on the 41st floor was completed. With the same momentum, they entered the 42nd floor and joined up with the troops there. They continued on to the 43rd floor at a breakneck pace and reached the 48th floor before the third day was up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was an achievement beyond their expectations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, things were different starting from the 49th floor.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Labyrinth: Floors 49-50</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahhhh, there&rsquo;s something on my neck!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sinking! My legs are melting!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Help me&mdash;I can&rsquo;t get my hand out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a scene from hell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment your guard was down, there were slimes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everywhere all around them, there were slimes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Slimes, slimes, slimes, slimes, slimes&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Halfway through their break, slimes began falling from the ceiling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment they turned a corner, they found that the platoon had been split up and annihilated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The walls were made of slime, and the floor was slime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Weapons and armor were destroyed, and the soldiers&rsquo; strength was drained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What the hell, is there no way to break through yet?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, we can&rsquo;t detect them with magic because they have spread to the entire floor. Moreover, they seem to be highly resistant to physical attacks, so any half-hearted attacks won&rsquo;t work!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Moreover, the speed at which the enemies multiply is extraordinary! They seem to have no sense of pain and do not seem to flinch from our attacks!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would not be so terrible if they were just normal slimes, but they grew to such a huge size, it would be difficult to burn them down. They had become a more troublesome opponent than expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the help of reinforcements every few hours, the damage was not so severe that they had to retreat. However, they were running out of time, and were not able to achieve the desired results. In the end, it was not until the end of the third day that they had finished exploring all of the floors. They were able to meet up with the team from the upper floors, and were finally able to get through with their mass maneuvering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the 50th floor, they came across a mountain of wounded people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a dark, dank, cave-like passageway. From there, the sounds of battle echoed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn those monsters&mdash;they&rsquo;re back!&rdquo; One of them shouted in a rage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ahead of their eyes, a huge snake, an incarnation of darkness, was writhing about in the passageway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a tempest serpent. Neither magic nor bullets could penetrate its armor-like scales. Even if you tried to cut them with a sword, the &lsquo;Poison Breath&rsquo; of the Tempest serpent could reach up to seven meters away. You would be hit by the mist of death before the sword could even reach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it! This narrow passageway is made for them!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can get around them in the open, but there is no way to get around them in here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the magic cannon coming along?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No good. We just used it. It&rsquo;ll take two hours to fill it up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;magic cannon&rdquo; was a new type of magic weapon that was the most powerful of all hand-held weapons. Unlike the &ldquo;spell gun&rdquo; which used a magic stone as its energy source, the &ldquo;magic cannon&rdquo; collected magicules from the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hidden magic was an elemental magic: &lsquo;Air Buster&rsquo;, a high-powered magic that continuously exploded the air after compressing it. It did not emit flames and could be directional. Therefore, it was useful in enclosed spaces such as inside of buildings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was an advanced magic, and only by being able to control it could one be certified as an A-rank magic user.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem, however, was that it consumed too much energy. It took three hours to fill up even in a labyrinth with high concentration of magicules. Normally it was fast enough, but this time it was still too slow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, come on, you&rsquo;ve got to be kidding. What does this mean? Will those monsters come back to life before we can replenish it?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tempest serpent was clearly an anomaly. It had a ring around its neck, which made it stand out from the other monsters. The most important point was that it revived after 3 hours no matter how many times it was defeated. In other words, no matter how many times they conquered it, the battle would be resumed due to the passage of time. Most troublesome of all was the fact that there was no safe zone in this floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sounds of battle began to echo in another corridor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, the Tempest Serpent was not alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were ten of them at least that had been confirmed. A swarm of A-minus ranked monsters with a highly dangerous floor was dominating the area where they could make the most of their characteristics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the lair of the black serpents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tempest serpents, which were normally Boss Monsters of the 40th floor, and used as reserves, had all been unleashed in this floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, the soldiers were able to join with the reinforcements from the upper floors and were able to increase their armaments. As a result, they secured enough magic cannons to outnumber the tempest serpents. It was not until midnight of the third day that they succeeded in conquering the floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;While maintaining this floor, watch out for the resurrection of the monsters. Evacuate the sick and wounded to the upper floors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, the Imperial Army reorganized their troops on the spot and set out for an even worse hell.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Labyrinth: Floors 51-60</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the fifty-first floor, a modern passageway was opened. It seemed that this floor had already been conquered, and soldiers could be seen at every corner. The visible signs of fierce battles suggested that this floor must have been a troublesome one as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the commanders attempted to make contact with the local forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is the situation?&rdquo; he asked quietly to the guard, trying not to wake the resting soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mess. We underestimated the demon lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;On this floor, the traps are dangerous. We&rsquo;re standing in the right passage. Don&rsquo;t go anywhere else. I think we&rsquo;ve destroyed most of the traps, but there may be some that still work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Got it. By the way&hellip;&rdquo; He asked for more details to report to his superiors. The soldier then told him about a number of chemical weapons that had not been employed even in the Empire&rsquo;s own country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tasteless and odorless gases that burned the eyes and throat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A shower of neurotoxins and acid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vicious traps that would entrap multiple people. They had always thought that their knowledge of these things had been their own exclusive domain, so this felt even more threatening now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No monsters will appear from this floor for a while. Instead, golems powered by magicules are roaming about. Trouble is, they seem to have a self-repairing function, and it took us a long time to completely destroy them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The commander wanted to say that they had had a hard time too, but he swallowed his words firmly and urged on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. The tired and wounded are resting on the fifty-fifth floor. Once there, it will be safe enough to have a meal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you. So, where is the front line at the moment?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The front line, eh? &hellip;According to what just came in, they are at the 60th floors. They also said some pretty unbelievable things, and I&rsquo;m sure the higher-ups will think I&rsquo;m crazy if I give them a report like this. Even so, do you still want to hear it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldier answered with a sigh, and as a unit commander, he had no choice but to nod his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay. Well then, apparently there is a huge humanoid &nbsp;weapon reigning on the 60th floor! And the strength of that thing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The more he heard, the more ridiculous it sounded. Even if A-rank warriors formed a mob to challenge it, they could not even grasp a clue of how to conquer it. The body was made of magisteel, and physical attacks such as swords and guns could not penetrate it. Moreover, it was always covered with a &lsquo;barrier&rsquo; and even the &lsquo;magic cannon&rsquo; would not work against it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was nothing they could do&mdash;That was the current situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Later, voices were heard coming from the giant golem, but it was such a surprise! They said it sounded just like Master Gadra. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it myself, and now I have to report about it? I can&rsquo;t stand this, I really can&rsquo;t take any more of this&hellip;&rdquo; the soldier concluded with a complaint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The commander decided to report it to his superiors and ask for further instructions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can only go forward now. Let&rsquo;s go to the fifty-fifth floor first, and then we will discuss our future course of action.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At such times, the only response to a superior could be &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. The commander did not have an alternative plan, and he did not object to this approach. However, this was only a postponement of the problem. An answer had to be given in the not-too-distant future, but in any case, there was no such thing as withdrawal for the Imperial Army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you going? Well, it&rsquo;s only natural. Good luck to you all, but before you go, I forgot to give you one more piece of advice. There are five special monsters that have been found. Be careful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Special monsters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. No one&rsquo;s reported any successful kills yet. They are definitely unique monsters. They&rsquo;re very nasty and have killed a lot of our men.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those five were a red slime, a golden skeleton, a ghosts like reaper, a living armor just like a heavy knight, and a small yet powerful dragon. Those fearsome monsters seemed to hide and lurk throughout these floors. They were unique presences amongst the golem hordes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldier told the commander for the last time that he should expect death if he encountered even one. The survivors from the upper floors took this advice to heart as they moved forward. It would only be a little while before they truly understood what lied ahead&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">More and more Imperial Army generals were descending, unaware of the death that lied before them. That line continued on, unbroken.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Labyrinth: Floors 61-70</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Still no victory?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry! It seems that we have failed this time as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this report, the generals despaired.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a huge gate on the 70th floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the border between this world and the City of Death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Imperial soldiers walked through the labyrinth, advancing their way through a swarm of dead spirit monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was all good at first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right. Only at first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The monsters that appeared were all dead spirit monsters. As long as the soldiers could get used to the smell of rotting flesh, the monsters were not a difficult enemy for an imperial general.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first thousand men secured the base. After confirming the appearance of the followers, the decision was made to continue the operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The loss of contact with the ground forces was a large blow, but they were not completely isolated. They judged that there was nothing to worry about, since the following soldiers would arrive in due time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The imperial troops overran the upper floors of the building at a furious pace. On the first day, they had completed the search for almost all of the 61-69 floors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem lay in the seventieth floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For some reason, the seventieth floor was a hilly area where all the grass and trees had withered away. The ruins of the battlefield were horrifying and filled with an air of death. At the end of the hill, there rose a huge gate, similar in size to the great gate on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The gate, made of skeletons, was located in the center of the wall that surrounded the castle town, and was the gate that protected the walled city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question on everyone&rsquo;s mind was why such a thing was in the labyrinth. The city had no entrances or exits other than the main gate. Drainage facilities, service gates, and all other facilities considered necessary for daily life were missing in the city as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was no wonder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That city was inhabited by the lifeless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were all immortal undead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the first day, the great gate remained closed. The soldiers had tried to break it down, but the walls were very thick. The immortals kept coming out of the gate to repair it, so the sabotage was slow in progress.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if they tried to approach the wall, they would find a skeleton archer with a bow on the outer wall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was decided that attacking with a small number of men would be troublesome, so they waited for the reinforcements to arrive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then came the morning of the second day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The number of the Imperial troops had increased to over 10,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As they set out to attack the gate, the gate was opened without a sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There appeared a wight king of great misfortune. To say that he was a skeleton was not right word. Those pure white polished bones spoke in fluent human language to the soldiers of the Imperial Army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Welcome to my kingdom of death. My name is Adalmann, the Immortal King. Let us have a good time! Shall we begin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as King Adalmann announced himself, the space was overcome with a sense of oppression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Following the king was a dead spirit knight and a death dragon that still boasted much majesty. The evil roar of the dead dragon was released with a force that crushed down on the entire space. And from the sky, the death dragon descended outside the gate. It was the moment when the deadliest dragon, the most supreme of the dead spirit lineage, bared its fangs to the imperial army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that was not all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The great gate was fully opened, and the army of immortals appeared one after another from within. The death knights led by the death lord crawled out one after another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The imperial army, which had been lined up in front of the gate, was thrown back and forth by the sudden start of the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The death dragon was a monster classified as Special A rank, and boasted a fearsome strength that required advance preparation in order to defeat it. Its attribute was &lsquo;immortality&rsquo;&mdash;the only way to destroy it was to attack its soul directly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers of the empire boasted of their high combat ability, but they were helpless in the face of an opponent whom their attacks could not touch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Retreat! We can&rsquo;t win this war by fighting in the dark.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it, then fire, burn it all down with fire!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No! It&rsquo;s regenerating faster than it&rsquo;s burning!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Get out of here now! Or else the miasma will destroy your spirit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Imperial Army was in turmoil. The dragon&rsquo;s jaws opened wide as if to taunt the soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh no! That&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pssssshh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The body is corroding&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The death dragon&rsquo;s corrosive breath poured down from the sky above, showering those crawling on the ground with it. As a result, most of them failed to resist it and died.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that was not all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those whose minds were contaminated by the death dragon&rsquo;s miasma became zombies, obeying the orders of the higher beings. The higher being here was the mighty king&mdash;that is, Adalmann. The damages of the empire led directly to the increase of Adalmann&rsquo;s strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This tragedy of the imperial army was not the only one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even those who had escaped the threat of the death dragon were not safe. The death knights began to drive the fleeing soldiers on death horses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The imperial army quickly dwindled in numbers, and in less than an hour 10,000 men were wiped out. The devastation was passed on to the next few survivors. With this, the battle for the 70th floor began in earnest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the second day, the Imperial Army had attempted to enter the 70th floor many times. Each time, however, they suffered a painful defeat. The second and third attempts were similar, and the situation was not improving at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not to mention, there was the overwhelming threat of death dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although there were only a thousand or so of them, a death knight was an opponent for whom neither fatigue nor death existed. Moreover, the threat level was very high&mdash;A-minus rank. They regenerated even after being defeated, which was unbearable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The death lord who commanded them was on par with the top-ranked warriors of the imperial army. Even in terms of quality alone, they were superior to the imperial army, and their ability to continue fighting overturned any disadvantages they may have had in terms of numbers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition, Albert the &ldquo;death paladin&rdquo;, one of the Elite Ten, was under Adalmann&rsquo;s command. Even the elites of the Imperial Army could not find a chance to win against this army of the Immortals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;But we will not repeat the mistakes of this mission. I look forward to your success!&rdquo; The colonel of the Imperial Army finished his speech to the generals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The upper floor attack team had joined the others for the fourth day, along with all of the existing forces. This operation would be an all-out war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the Imperial Army was not incompetent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their means of attack against undead immortals were known to all ages and cultures. Against the immortal monsters, the enemy of mankind, holy magic was the most effective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The principles of holy magic were well-known. The research of holy magic had been progressing, and the empire had developed the technique which had the similar effect to a prayer to a deity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Imperial Army also had skilled veterans in this field.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had gathered such people from the existing forces and assigned them to each unit. By doing so, they would create resistance to the evil miasma and the ability to break through the enemy&rsquo;s &lsquo;immortality&rsquo;. This would be the crux of their mission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Imperial troops lined up on the hillside. Their total numbered 70,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalmann&rsquo;s forces, on the other hand, numbered less than 40,000, even with the number of zombies from the past few days were counted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that time, everyone believed that because the Imperial Army had the advantage in numbers, this time they would be victorious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then the decisive battle began. The king made his move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You guys are not thinking straight. Extra Skill &lsquo;Holy-Demonic Reversal&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;Immortal King&rdquo; Adalmann&rsquo;s rule extended to the very end. The holy attribute, which had been a weakness, was no longer a weakness in the face of his power. The imperial army, which had relied upon it, suffered a crushing defeat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">This defeat shattered the hearts of the Imperial general. The survivors, driven to despair, begin their flight to the upper floors. The conditions for clearing the labyrinth were forgotten. The only thing left in their minds was their desire to live, the desire for survival.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Labyrinth: Floors 71-79</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The imperial troops who advanced to this floor were forced to fight endless battles against swarms of insects. An endless onslaught of bugs. Unafraid of death, the swarms attacked unceasingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On first day in the labyrinth&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first soldiers sent in were frightened by the onslaught of bugs, but they were not afraid. They established a stronghold in the passage they had conquered, and showed that they could respond to the onslaught immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bugs, dozens of times larger than normal, were not only terrifying but also powerful. If they were not careful, they would be devoured in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, if one kept a cool head, they would be able to recognize that each and every one of them was not so strong individually. Besides, the fact that they never stopped meant that the number of &ldquo;magic crystals&rdquo; they could get was huge. The quality of the magic crystals was high, so the faces of the soldiers began to light up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What a big deal</span><span class="c1">, the soldiers thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a normal group of adventurers, they would not be able to take a rest, and they would be exhausted. Then they would be defeated eventually because they would not be able to exert their full strength. However, the soldiers did not have to worry about that. If a well-trained army was attacking, a swarm of bugs was no match for them. No matter how many bugs there were, the imperial army still outnumbered them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They could replace and change shifts whenever they got tired, and they always maintained their readiness. Thus, the strongholds were increased one after another, and the invasion proceeded smoothly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no time for relaxation, but this was all that mattered. On the other hand, there was also a great deal to be gained. This floor, a paradise for insects, also had a number of traps and hidden rooms, such as tree caves and caverns. There were powerful monsters, but there were also treasure chests.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some of the soldiers were smiling at the opulence of the treasures. They must have been the ones who opened the treasure chest in the previous room and found a dagger inside. It was an expensive looking dagger with gold and silver works. It seemed to be of excellent quality, and the gleam of the blade was proof that it was made of magisteel. The dagger was made only of magisteel, even &nbsp;though a dagger made with a core of magisteel would be expensive. It was no wonder the soldier was smiling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was explained that &ldquo;magic crystals&rdquo; and other items would be kept by the military upon entering this labyrinth. However, if it was a small item like a dagger, there was a high possibility that certain things will be overlooked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, the soldiers would have their belongings inspected later, but considering the credit of defeating the boss guarding the treasure, it was certain that the item would belong to this soldier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers around him looked envious, but they all secretly thought that this was a chance for their turn to be next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it weren&rsquo;t for such perks, they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to continue fighting against the insects in a place like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were quite a few &ldquo;magic crystals&rdquo; that had been collected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">High purity &ldquo;magic crystals&rdquo;, which would be rare under normal circumstances, could be easily obtained here just by defeating monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was exactly what was meant when it was said that the soldiers couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling. At this rate, the bonuses were about to be very colorful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other floors of the dungeon were similar to each other as far as they had heard. The most miserable area was place full of undead people, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Against dead spirits, there was not much to gain. In proportion to that, it was also hard to defeat them. Compared with them, the floor where these insects were wriggling around was probably a better place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the very least, the treasures they could get were satisfying, and all of them had happy fantasies that they would have a good time once we returned home.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things started getting out of hand on the second day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A soldier&rsquo;s eyes widened in surprise. The head of his companion, who had been walking next to him, suddenly rolled on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a good time when we get back&hellip;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking down at the headless body on the ground, the soldier&rsquo;s expression was puzzled. His inarticulate voice came to a halt mid-sentence, and his mouth hung open in shock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Blood spurted upwards. Like a fountain, it poured back down on the others around him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-Hey!&rdquo; screamed a soldier. The sudden devastation of the person he had been speaking with was difficult to comprehend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that soldier was lucky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was chosen as the next victim before even being able to think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another head dropped to the floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like the first soldier, who had become a silent corpse, that man soon died.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their place of death was the seventy-ninth floor. A place where beautiful flowers bloomed, a floor that, until just now, had been considered a safe zone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ufufufu. It was worth waiting all day. So much bait has gathered that they came all the way out here. You guys did a great job. Now die and become fodder for us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers heard the voice clearly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A beautiful voice that echoed across the floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the queen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the beautiful voice of the Floor Boss: &ldquo;Insect Queen&rdquo; Apito, the guardian of this floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito&rsquo;s voice was converted into thought waves and echoed throughout the floor to reliably convey her commands to her faithful servants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito was leading a group called the &lsquo;Army Wasps&rsquo;. They were a band of killers in the form of bees about 30 centimeters long.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They possessed superior Ultra Intuition and did not miss any hidden humans. Their small, transparent wings became terrifying blades that emitted a high-frequency radiation, allowing them to move at irregularly high speeds with ease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were Silent Killer Wasps that could sneak up on you faster than the speed of sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To fight against the Army Wasps, it was not enough just to have excellent dynamic vision. It was impossible to detect the opponent unless one exceeded the limits of the human race. To begin with, if one didn&rsquo;t have Extra Skill &lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo; and &lsquo;Super Speed Reaction&rsquo;, they would be unable to even detect their opponent&rsquo;s movement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if it had been only one monster, it was a monster that was considered a disaster of the Special A rank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Incidentally, in the Western Nations, an emergency alert was usually issued when even one of these monsters was found. Immediately, the upper echelons of each country would be notified, and a strike team would be organized by senior knights. If possible, the Holy Knight Order would also be called in, and a large-scale cleanup operation would be carried out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They would be hunted down from the surroundings with holy barriers, and then would be weakened with magic before being killed. Even so, the monster was so formidable that they would have to be prepared for the possibility of casualties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If more than one of them is discovered, the danger level would increase dramatically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just what did it mean if they were being controlled by the queen? The answer was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The number of Army Wasps who received orders from Apito easily exceeded a thousand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so it began&mdash;a one-sided slaughter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyone with confidence in their skills were of no use. Even if they were an A-ranked soldier, if they were below a certain level, they were no better than an amateur at this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If one couldn&rsquo;t react, death would surely be waiting for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took less than a few minutes for all of the imperial soldiers gathered in this floor to be killed.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Labyrinth: Floors 81-90</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It could be concluded by now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That first day had only been to give them a taste of something sweet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every surviving soldier thought as such.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their comrades-in-arms were gone. They had all been killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The monster in front of them&mdash;a monster with the strength of a demon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet they were not the only unhappy ones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Similar tragedies were also being staged on other floors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone was now engaged in a desperate battle. At each floor, against each formidable foe, they were forced to fight a battle against which there was no chance of victory&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The 81st floor was a paradise for magic beasts. Powerful individuals walked about, leading their herds. But they were still magic beasts without wisdom. They were the kind of foe that experienced imperial soldiers could defeat with ease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On average, the strength of each of them would be equivalent to B rank or higher. Since they appeared in teams of three to five, the soldiers had a harder time than expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there were not so many casualties, and they were able to find the stairs. They were able to meet up with the team that had conquered the 82nd floor, which was a good achievement for the first day. At this rate, it was judged that they would be able to conquer the floor within a few days, even if it would take some time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, on the second day of the attack, the situation changed drastically when &lsquo;that guy&rsquo; appeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the 82nd floor, in the jungle, appeared a wise monkey who spoke human language. He controlled both wind and sound, and called up storms in the sky. He was a pure white monkey named Byakuren. His supple frame was beautifully adorned with a coat of pure white fur. The way it ran across the battlefield in all directions was so beautiful that it was almost like watching a live performance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had a unique technique using a club and could perform aerial attacks at will. In addition, it was an extremely dangerous magic beast that fired vacuum blades in all directions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Byakuren had used his sorcery to the point of almost destroying the imperial army. He rampaged as he pleased for an hour or so, then left like the wind. He said he would be back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two days passed. The raids were repeated regularly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One by one the Imperial comrades fell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With their pride as Imperial soldiers, they had fought desperately against these magic beasts and were defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The snipers&rsquo; shots were blocked by the storm, and magic that weakened or affected abnormal effects was prevented by sorcery. The spell gun was not enough to break through the wind barrier. As for melee combat, the Augmented Legion, the most elite of the Imperial Army, was being played for a fool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Byakuren was tossing around elite soldiers like children. And when the time came, Byakuren finally retreated. The reason was simple and clear. They were waiting for the imperial soldiers to gather.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, the soldiers were angry that they had been taken advantage of, but now they only hoped they could retreat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The number of survivors was now less than a thousand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A soldier wondered how long he would live.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t know how this had happened, no matter how many times he thought about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In his vision, he saw the shadow of a white monkey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without an answer to the question of just when did things get so out of hand, a dark curtain fell over the soldier&rsquo;s vision&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Floor 83&mdash;a grassy plain with good visibility stretched out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While there were cute traps such as pitfalls set about, these not much for obstacles. The weather was clear. The faces of the marchers were cheerful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the second night, the imperial army suffered heavy damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moon was shining in the sky, moving from waxing to full. With the moon as a backdrop, a solitary rabbit floated in the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was Gett, the moon rabbit, who manipulated gravity. With Gett&rsquo;s attacks, there was no distinction between friend and foe. He could give his all without worrying about the damage. Although this depended on the phase of the moon, Gett had the power to turn the heavens and the earth upside down even if it was a new moon. The Imperial Army was at the mercy of the super-gravity crushing violence that was unleashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this was not the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The night would come once again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in three days, the moon would be full. The night when the Gett&rsquo;s power would be maximized eventually came.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The 84th floor&mdash;a labyrinth of cobblestone streets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Imperial soldiers who walk through the maze looked pale. They seemed more exhausted than expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Water, please&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. I can&rsquo;t reach the supply line. We have to be patient.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn! It&rsquo;s only been three days, but I need some water&hellip; If I can&rsquo;t drink water, I can&rsquo;t eat&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A reinforced soldier who has undergone remodeling surgery was moaning because he couldn&rsquo;t take the thirst. It was a scene that was hard to believe at first glance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this was inevitable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had prepared only enough drinking water for the water bottles that each of them carried, because they could magically produce water. It was judged that the food they carried would more important than the water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was a mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This floor was filled with toxins, and it was not possible to drink the water simply by collecting water from the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only on the third day that they realized this. Some of the soldiers had become ill and the situation was finally noticed. Moreover, the poison was so bad that the antidote magic did not work. No matter how many times they tried to remove it, they found that the poison was still mixed in the water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fortunately, breathing was not a problem&hellip;but even so, the damage to the soldiers was becoming severe. Even now, the soldiers at the front of the group had fallen down in agony. When looking at them, black spots could be seen on their skin and that they were burning up with fever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Again! He&rsquo;s very weak and needs medical treatment&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no doctor here! What about healing magic?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t work&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this way, one by one, their comrades fell ill. The imperial soldiers, seeing this, were anxious that it would be their turn to fall next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then a small monster ran past their feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a black rat no more than five centimeters long. The soldiers did not pay attention to it, because it seemed to be so harmless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was a big mistake. These rats were the main cause of this situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The black rat Kokuso&mdash;it was the Floor Boss of this floor. The ruler of the plague, spreading the black deadly disease. That was the essence of Kokuso.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The imperial soldiers were completely mistaken. They were so preoccupied with the powerful magic beasts that roamed the streets that they missed the weak black rats that would kill them if they stepped on them. They did not realize that they were the messengers of Kokuso, and left a pathogen spreading entity if unattended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there had been someone like Shinji who possessed a Unique Skill, this could have been neutralized. Unfortunately, there was no such doctor who was conveniently available.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Magical cures were not very effective against diseases. Magic to heal the wounded had no effect on the sick, no matter how specialized the magic may be. It could only restore the strength of the body, but it could not cure the disease. This was because the treatment of injury and the treatment of disease are based on completely different principles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the first place, the users of holy magic who could completely cure illnesses were rare, with only one or two in each country. It was impossible for them to accompany the warriors except under special circumstances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, &ldquo;death&rdquo; spread throughout this floor as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Floor 85&mdash;where a great tiger conquered a deciduous forest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The magic beasts that had been rampaging freely in the other floors were united before the king in this floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The king&rsquo;s name was the thunder tiger, Raikou</span><sup class="c5 c18"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The imperial army had the upper hand until Raikou appeared, but from then on, the odds were against them. They were on the defensive, and their stronghold was pushed back to the front of the stairway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Inside the forest, the monsters were in control. Against the odds, the resistance of the Imperial Army continued&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Floor 86&mdash;the middle of a desert area where an oasis was sparsely located.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sun shone and the temperature rose. At night, the temperature dropped, and it was bitterly cold. The extreme difference in temperatures deprived the Imperial soldiers of their physical strength regardless of the battle. That is why the generals thought that the temperature was the greatest enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was not wrong, but it was also not the correct answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The real trap was the oxygen concentration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The winged serpent&mdash;Yoda</span><sup class="c5 c18"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c1">&mdash;controlled the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Manipulating the composition of the atmosphere to reduce the oxygen concentration to zero was as easy for Yoda as twisting a baby&rsquo;s hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Imperial soldiers, who believed that the temperature difference was causing them to feel ill, simply assumed that a night&rsquo;s rest would restore them to health. And then they quietly passed away.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The 87th floor&mdash;a mountainous region that spread out to a vast expanse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This peaceful landscape reminded the soldiers of their families. Once they became relaxed, they would think back to their happy childhood. They dreamed of meeting their loved ones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took less than five days for the atmosphere to relax. The low frequency of monsters was another reason. Unlike the other floors, it was difficult to maintain tension here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because of this, they did not notice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The shift workers went to sleep and did not wake up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that they appeared to be awake was all a hallucination of their own imagination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the Sleeping sheep&mdash;Mink. This gentle, peace-loving sheep bloodlessly reaped the consciousness of the soldiers. Those lulled to sleep by Mink&rsquo;s hallucinogenic hypnosis were put into a sleep from which they would never wake.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Floor 88&mdash;These forests along the river were the habitat of firebirds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Strangely enough, the firebird&rsquo;s flames did not spread to the trees. They reacted only to those who were hostile to them and continued to burn fiercely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Flame bird&mdash;Enchou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the name of the Floor Boss of this land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Enchou and his flaming birds were burning the imperial army to death.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The 89th floor&mdash;a maze of mirrors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This floor was not affected by vegetation. It was well maintained, and all the mirrored surfaces were well polished. The passageways were all reflected in the mirrors, complicating the maze further. Moreover, the mirrors were unbreakable. This is because it was created by a secret technique exercised by a monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Igami&mdash;the mirror dog, ran along the surface of the mirror.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He ran through the mirror at will and played with the imperial army. His body was in the mirror, and the mirror bounced all the magic back to the user. It was difficult to even catch the true identity of this monster called Igami. The poor prey was devoured by the countless numbers of attacks Igami reflected in the mirror.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At each floor, the vicious Floor Bosses were on a rampage. In their own area of expertise, these bosses were able to show their full strength. However, the Imperial Army also resisted desperately. Sometimes they were able to defeat them, and there were loud cheers when they did so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monsters could be resurrected. They came back again and again. This fact was more frightening than anything else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers had heard of similar situations in the other floors. Knowing this, the hearts of the soldiers were broken. They realized that there was no point in continuing in this hopeless battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the most desperate thing of all&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A monkey, a rabbit, a rat, a tiger, a snake, a sheep, a bird, and a dog were all animal beasts&mdash;that is, the eight members of Kumara. They were nothing more than her cute pets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These magic beasts were the disguised forms of Kumara&rsquo;s tails, and their abilities were merely given to them by Kumara.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The true nature of Kumara was the aggregation of these eight parts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara was no longer a child, but a beautiful woman of this floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The illusionary &nbsp;queen who ruled these animal beasts&mdash;that was the &ldquo;nine head&rdquo; Kumara, the Guardian of the 90th floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before such a Kumara, even more foolish and pathetic victims began building up. They were nothing but food for Kumara, and more deaths were to be mass-produced in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few days passed after 530,000 soldiers of the Imperial Army completed the labyrinthine siege.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">There were no survivors in the labyrinth.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1128.82px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.88px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.4d34og8"><span class="c5 c22">Chapter 4</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c25">Complete Victory</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">It had been seven days since the labyrinth siege had started.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The labyrinth swallowed every soldier that tried to go in, and yet it remained silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio spent his time being annoyed at how he had not yet received any report from inside. His act of annoyance was for concealing the instinctive fear growing from within him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were still unable to get in touch with the other units, in addition, they had lost contact with the inside of the labyrinth. On the face of it, they were completely isolated in enemy territory. This situation made Calgurio uneasy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is nobody going to return yet?!&rdquo; He even shouted, still no one answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Silence was his only reply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only Calgurio, but also his staff, understood that the situation was not good. On the first day, they had dispatched soldiers countless times, and they were able to bring out information from inside. Although not one soldier had returned, they had been able to communicate with them inside at first. With every information collected, they had gotten a rough idea of what was going on inside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon entering the labyrinth, one needed to verify their identity. Then, the conditions for clearing the labyrinth would be presented to you.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Defeat the Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten and you can collect the ten keys. With the ten keys, it is said that you can obtain the right to challenge the king. And once you defeat the king, the labyrinth shall be cleared.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Initially, this was considered simple. However, now that judgement, without a doubt, had been a grave misunderstanding. Based on the information collected, the labyrinth had at least more than 50 floors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The floors changed for every 1000 men, but the soldiers were received in a regular rotation. This allowed them to make contact with the soldiers that had already gone inside. However, their first contact was when the number of soldiers that had entered was already more than 50,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Based on how many times the labyrinth was entered, it could be inferred that there were 54 floors or more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Yuuki, Shinji&rsquo;s team had reported that the labyrinth had 60 floors, but that information was quickly established to be unreliable. After all, the strength of the monsters in the labyrinth was completely different from what they had said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To begin with, the moment it was said that the boss of the labyrinth was a wight king, the story of Shinji&rsquo;s group had already lost its credibility. It was because a report that came on day 2 had informed them that a floor that was ruled by a wight king was discovered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Apparently, that wight king was one of Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten&hellip;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Some were even saying the rumors may be true. Now, anyone laughing about those rumors was gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even with the best of the elites, it&rsquo;s no good, huh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. If this continues, the conquest will end in failure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio shivered; he couldn&rsquo;t accept the situation. Because the conquest ending in a failure was an understatement. It was so much worse than that; it would mean the death of 530,000 soldiers. He could not just easily abandon the invaluable soldiers Emperor Rudra had entrusted to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has been only seven days. There was still time to reach the limit, and the attack was still going on in the labyrinth. They just had to wait and believe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That should be the right thing to do, but Calgurio, or rather, not only Calgurio but all the general staffs, felt that it was not a good idea to continue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What made them think that way was the existence of &ldquo;Elite Ten&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Currently, there were four keys that they had obtained. The monsters were said to resurrect whether they were defeated or not, but they had succeeded in obtaining keys from the four dragon kings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, as for the remaining six, there was no way to defeat them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The wight king, and the death paladin who seemed to be his right hand were some of them. Then there was the queen who rules the insects plus the lady of the beasts. Then there was the offensive golem, nicknamed the ghost of Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The identity of the last one, for example, was unknown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unless these six were defeated, clearing the labyrinth would be nothing but a pipe dream. With the forces inside the labyrinth, it was impossible to achieve their goals&mdash;Calgurio agreed, and the general staff were unanimous in their opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s no use deploying all of our forces in this situation&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That will only wear us down. Besides, the defenses here will be insecure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what should be done? There was only one answer. The only way was to attack the labyrinth the way it was supposed to be attacked&mdash;with an elite team.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, the question became who to choose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio, after some deliberation, decided to gather the best from among the corps. He gathered a hundred men and women. He recruited only the best and the strongest of each unit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sitting in the front row was a graceful, elegant man. Even on the battlefield, he wore a straightened uniform. His name was Minits, the man Calgurio relied on the most, and he held the high position of Major General. He was recommended by Calgurio as the commander of this operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next to Minits sat a grinning man with a cigarette in his mouth. His fearless gaze, as if he were staring at his prey, and his well-groomed beard inspired a sense of awe to those who encountered him. He was also a man who was capable enough not to betray such feelings. Colonel Kansas. He was a champion who had left behind many, many brilliant achievements. The most famous among them was the &ldquo;animal beast&rdquo; extermination campaign. The man who led this mission was Kansas himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His attitude was very self-confident, perhaps as a sign of his achievements. Even in the presence of his superiors, he showed no sign of fear. No one around him paid any mind to warn Kansas. It was no wonder, after all, Minits who was &nbsp;Kansas&rsquo;s immediate superior even tolerated his attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio had his own feelings about this, but he did not think it was worth complaining to the famous champion of the empire. He left the matter in the hands of Minits, the superior, and there was no one here to criticize Kansas&rsquo;s actions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other two famous people were Lucius and Raymond.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These two were otherworlders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucius had the Unique Skill &lsquo;Fusionist&rsquo;. He was good at using his power to attack with high firepower and was well-known among the imperial army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raymond had the Unique Skill &lsquo;Martial Artist&rsquo;. He was a former martial artist, who seemed to become integrated with his Skill. He was a top-notch warrior who could use all kinds of weapons, martial arts, and even Art which he learned in this world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These four were the most famous elites, but the others chosen were also great warriors. They were all of A rank at the very least, and were the elite of the elites, one in ten thousand in the Imperial Army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These hundred alone were capable of destroying the knights of other countries. Calgurio had decided to entrust the entire operation to these champions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, everyone. You have heard the situation, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They nodded silently. Some men like Kansas grinned, but most of them listened to Calgurio&rsquo;s words with serious expressions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In the labyrinth, our comrades are waiting for our help. In order to leave the labyrinth, we must fulfill a condition, and that condition includes defeating the demon lord. Our Armored Corps, the strongest in the empire, will be able to solve this problem. However! We can&rsquo;t be wasting our time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This labyrinth was not a place that could be conquered with just a few troops. Calgurio understood this, but he could not say so honestly. He explained the situation to his men in a way that was not too flippant, because such an act would be demoralizing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Defeat the Elite Ten or something like that in the labyrinth and collect the ten keys. If you do so, you will have the right to challenge Demon Lord Rimuru. That is exactly what I expect you to do. I ask you to defeat the demon lord!&rdquo; Calgurio spoke up in front of the elite of the Armored Corps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calgurio-sama, the demon lord is no enemy to our glorious Imperial Army. Let us prove it now!&rdquo; Minits, the highest in rank, answered on behalf of the others. With a graceful gesture, he promised victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no one here who could disagree with such a Minits. They were all proud of their skills, and all of them were confident of their victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the brave men were chosen to challenge the demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They just did not know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was because they did not know that they were still able to hope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was because they did not know that they were blind to the dangers of the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The right thing to do at this moment would have been to retreat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now it was too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s decision had come too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle in the labyrinth had already ended, and there was no one left alive in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had no idea that such a thing had already happened&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The chosen heroes entered the daunting labyrinth with high spirits.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Interestingly enough, the imperials ignored the warnings on the gate. They sent even more soldiers into the labyrinth than we had expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great! This is more than we expected!&rdquo; I muttered to myself, and Benimaru nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No one has been strong enough to warrant our attention. It&rsquo;s probably because the Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten are so strong, but this is going to be easier than we thought.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He said as such and there was no caution in his eyes. He seemed to have switched his attention to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like there&rsquo;s been another movement.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. This time they&rsquo;re not relying on numbers, they&rsquo;re being selective. They should have made their decision earlier anyway. Then the labyrinthine forces would have had a harder time&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, hey, that&rsquo;s good for us though, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yes, that&rsquo;s true. But when things go so well, it makes me nervous&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was saying something like this, but his expression seemed to indicate that he believed the result to be a foregone conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was not the issue&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He just wanted the empire to do well because he was going to be out of the spotlight, didn&rsquo;t he?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I understood how he felt or not&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, no. If I did, that would make me a combat maniac too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not like Benimaru and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m happy with these results.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, as I have said many times before, in this world, quality is more important than quantity. We could consider these selected units as the main force of the enemy. There was a high possibility that they would destroy Elite Ten individually, so this was not the time to fool around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The goal was to thin out the enemy forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This had been accomplished sufficiently already. The number of the Imperial forces was now only a few hundred thousand, and the had been reduced to a level that even the Western Nations could cope with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the main thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As was true betting, the strategy was to win a big victory at the beginning and make the enemy lose their chance to stop the game. The image of victory became so big that it gave the illusion that one could recover even if they lost a lot. Even if they became aware of it, it was hard to stop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is exactly what had happened to the Imperial Army this time, and as a result of repeated successive introductions of forces, they had put in all their forces to the point of irreversible defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for us, we were very thankful to have achieved our goal so far, but we had not yet achieved our goal of weeding out the other strongmen. There were some powerful ones, but none of them seemed like they would be able to defeat me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, I had not been a demon lord in Chloe&rsquo;s story, so I guess I was not so different in strength from the time when I was defeated by Hinata then&hellip; Still, I didn&rsquo;t see anyone who even felt like much of a threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I had to say so, I would say that Testarossa killed the legendary-grade players.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Davis, the eleventh rank, might have been able to kill me. Of course, not the me now, but the me from when I first fought with Hinata. After all, the person in question had not been seen yet, so that was the conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would just put that on hold for now since there was no point in thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What I was interested in now was what the enemy commander was thinking. If the situation was so miserable, they would normally choose to retreat&hellip; I wondered what the enemy commander was thinking.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. Since the communication with other units has been blocked, they may not be fully aware of the current situation. They are presumably clinging to an impossible hope and have not given up on victory.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oops, Wisdom King Raphael-san was a bit harsh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess that made sense. But then again, too much control over information warfare was also a bad idea. If the commander had known what was going on, he might have retreated early.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Negative. If we don&rsquo;t hit them thoroughly when we can, it will leave a lasting grudge. There is no need to show mercy to the intruder.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s a harsh statement. It sounds rational and ruthless, but I think it is also correct. If we left a large force behind, the empire would not give up their ambition. But if we beat them thoroughly, we can avoid war, at least for the time being.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Doing things halfway was not the best way to go about anything. The enemy had families too, and those who were left behind would be sad. But&hellip; By making them realize their own stupidity, we may be able to deter future wars. This was not justice by any means, but at least it was the right thing to do in terms of eliminating skirmishes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, it was too late for anything now. In my case, unlike Wisdom King Raphael-san, I was indecisive. If the enemy ran away, I would let them do as they liked, and if they attacked again, I would crush them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps I was still naive to leave the decision-making to others. I understood it, but it was my nature, and I couldn&rsquo;t fix it so easily. The truth was that I didn&rsquo;t want them to attack me, and I hoped they wouldn&rsquo;t give me any trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was lamenting secretly in my mind, I received a call from Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Rimuru, is this a good time?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yes, yes. This is Rimuru, no problem.&rsaquo; From the tone of her voice, it did not sound urgent, but what could it be about?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Well, you know, another hundred or so are coming, right?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;It seems so. They seem to be stronger enemies this time.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yeah, yeah. So, I got a request from the Elite Ten.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I heard what Ramiris had to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Request No.1 was proposed by Gadra. Apparently, he knew someone who was one of the intruders into the labyrinth. Their names were Lucius and Raymond, and they were otherworlders. He said he would try to persuade them to join our group somehow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Request No.2 was proposed by Kumara. Kumara had also seen a familiar face among the intruders. Unlike Gadra, however, he was not an acquaintance, but rather, he was the target of a vendetta. He was said to be the one who destroyed &ldquo;Youma (animal beast) Township&rdquo;, the hometown of Kumara and her friends, and sold Kumara to Demon Lord Clayman at a very young age, though she was almost 300 years old at that time. The man who sold her. I didn&rsquo;t know that such a vicious bastard was a member of the Imperial Army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These were the only two requests they had, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you think, Benimaru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, attacking with masses is the shortcut to victory, but it&rsquo;s not exactly pretty. I know that there is nothing clean or dirty in war, but I think we should grant the requests, don&rsquo;t you? If Gadra can convince them, that&rsquo;s good enough, and if we fail, it won&rsquo;t hurt us that much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Since we&rsquo;re going to spread out our forces anyway, let&rsquo;s leave those two to Gadra. And as for Kumara&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No one wants to be hindered in their revenge,&rdquo; he said. Benimaru&rsquo;s words carried weight when he said that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara, by the way, had been manipulated by Clayman&rsquo;s Demon Dominate spell. It was natural that she would want to take revenge if the man who caused this came right to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although people say that revenge brings you nothing, it can give you a way to vent. It would be better to confront this than to hold on to the feelings you have.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I approved of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ramiris, I approve.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Great! You&rsquo;re the man, Rimuru, you know what you&rsquo;re talking about!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;We want to spread out the forces anyway, so we&rsquo;ll have only Lucius and Raymond at Gadra&rsquo;s area. Kumara&rsquo;s area&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That bearded guy! I don&rsquo;t know what his name is, but he&rsquo;s got a nasty look on his face.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris was completely on Kumara&rsquo;s side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I felt the same way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Send him in. And tell Kumara to do her best!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ok! I&rsquo;ll take care of it.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, the requests were accepted. As for the distribution of the remaining forces&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like that guy over there is in command. Rimuru-sama, leave him all alone and let Apito clean him up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru said such cruel things without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could he so easily suggest such a strategy when he had said earlier that it was not beautiful to attack and bully with the masses?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, I agreed with his opinion, nonetheless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ramiris, I heard that that fashionable middle-aged guy over there is the commander, so lets send him to Apito&rsquo;s place all alone.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I see. We&rsquo;re going to take away his ability to lead and make them lose cohesion. Rimuru&rsquo;s got some dirty tricks up his sleeve.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;What?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I turned out to be the bad guy?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was shocked, but Ramiris seemed convinced on her own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Well then, I guess Adalmann can take care of the remaining hundred or so, right?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I agree! My dragon kings lost, but everyone else is still doing their best. I&rsquo;ll ask them to keep up the good work until the end!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris seemed a little disappointed, but it could not be helped. Even the dragon lords had a bad time against the oncoming army. Unlike the other Elite Ten, the hierarchy of the terrain effect was vast. They had played an important role in terms of harassment, but they lost their advantage when the information was shared, and countermeasures were taken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In such a situation, I thought they did a good job. Although they lost four of the keys, six Elite Ten members were still undefeated. I would let them keep up the good work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it to you! But be on your guard. There may be some dangerous ones among those 100.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, don&rsquo;t worry! Everyone was all excited to hear that Rimuru was watching them. Besides, the king of the labyrinth is Master Veldora.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was true. The condition to clear the labyrinth this time was &ldquo;to collect 10 keys, challenge the king of the labyrinth, and win.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t imagine Veldora being defeated, so I felt we could rest assured about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I guess so. Well then, keep up the good work!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Leave it to us!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With those cheerful words, Ramiris ended the &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well then, now it was time to take a break.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I turned my attention back to the big screen to watch the final battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

It was dangerous to believe, but they still rested, thinking that they were safer than the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">General Calgurio had called them and ordered them to enter the labyrinth. They had no complaints about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucius and his friends, like Shinji and his friends, were otherworlders picked up by Gadra. They felt indebted to Gadra for helping them to make a living in this world where they did not know what was right and wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That same Gadra had gone missing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seemed to have gone to Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s territory on a mission with a special team.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra had returned, but all the other team members had not returned yet. Gadra had reported to Yuuki that his companion was killed in battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, even Gadra disappeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rumors had been circulating that he had gone on his way to rescue his teammates. It was a little hard to believe this rumor from the point of view of those who knew Gadra, but if that was true, they could not leave him behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The people who accompanied Gadra, who were said to have died in the war, were people whom Lucius and the others knew very well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were Shinji Tanimura, Mark Lauren, and Xin Liuxing, three of their fellow countrymen whom they had become friends with having come from another world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a bit hard to believe, but in fact, Shinji and the others did not return. Their mission was to investigate the labyrinth, and they believed that something must have happened there with the Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was reasonable to assume that Shinji and the other three who challenged Demon Lord Rimuru were killed as a result.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some of their fellow countrymen were saddened by the loss of Shinji and the others. Lucius and Raymond, and many others. Just because they were from the same place, there was a mysterious sense of solidarity that lasted among them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, Shinji was a surprisingly kind man who was a leader and never left anyone in need of help. Although he was a bit insensitive, there were even people who looked up to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a debt of gratitude he had received from Gadra. In addition, he wanted to know about the safety of his close friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After discussing these thoughts with his friends, it was decided that Lucius and Raymond, the two with the greatest fighting ability, would go into hiding during this expedition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They immediately submitted their opinions to Yuuki, but their request was rejected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">&ldquo;It is really dangerous to act now. It&rsquo;s a bit of a mess, and it&rsquo;s better not to make any moves. I can&rsquo;t tell you the details, but I&rsquo;m sure Shinji and the others are safe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They did not take it seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Yuuki said it is dangerous, it must be really dangerous. However, there were some who were not convinced. If they were left alone, they might jump out on their own, and it was believed that Lucius and Raymond, who were still specialized in fighting, would be able to deal with such a situation if something happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For this reason, Lucius decided to act on his own. Raymond agreed with him, and the two of them went into action without telling Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were reassigned from the Mixed Corps to Armored Corps and engaged in this operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because of this situation, the order from Calgurio was just what they wanted&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It may have been a mistake to go inside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yeah. I didn&rsquo;t expect the enemy to be this strong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were sent to the 59th floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unbeknownst to the two of them, there was a plan to call them up to the 60th floor out of the blue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there was a possibility that these two were hiding their abilities. It was also possible that someone might be in disguise, so the plan was to wait and see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Incidentally, this was the plan of Rimuru&mdash;or rather &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris and Gadra were also convinced that Rimuru was being cautious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For this reason, Lucius and his team were exposed to a fierce battle at the 59th floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Variable laser cannons and sonic cannons. And many other scientific weapons. Once the Isolation Wall was down, a tasteless, odorless, poison-gas-generating corridor was prepared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many of the weapons created in the 95-floor laboratory, which now had 100 floors, were in operation on the 59th floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the most impressive thing of all was a humanoid weapon specialized for offensive attacks, the majin form (golem).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru brought back the materials from the ruins of &ldquo;Amalita&rdquo; discovered in Puppet Nation Jistav. The defense mechanism that Rimuru had them study and reproduce had been put to full use here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Weapons that did not require even ten percent of their functions even when they were used to destroy the imperial army. They were now used to test Lucius and Raymond.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A serious battle ensued, with both men exposing their full arsenal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raymond stood at the vanguard, buying time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that precious time, Lucius delivered the killing blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucius&rsquo; &lsquo;Fusionist&rsquo; was as effective as its name suggested. He could mix matter and extract energy from it. Depending on its use, it could be used for attacks equivalent to nuclear magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Gadra who discovered and taught him this technique. Lucius fought desperately, remembering the debt he owed to his mentor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle itself was a great victory for both of them. Neither the golems nor the scientific weaponry was a match for the massive destructive force of the attack. However, the number of these weapons was too great. It was very difficult for the two of them to break through all these traps alone, and it was no wonder that Lucius and Raymond were exhausted after only one day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey&hellip; What should we do? Shall we go on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. We&rsquo;ve only gone down one flight of stairs. It&rsquo;s dangerous to go down there without any countermeasures when there&rsquo;s so many weapons and traps.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. But we don&rsquo;t have any other choice, do we? We lost the others as soon as we entered the labyrinth&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raymond was right. Even Lucius understood that, but he couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was dangerous to go forward, but what was the right thing to do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no guarantee that they would get out of the labyrinth even if they went up instead of down. Rather, if they were to believe in the confirmation of intention from when they entered the labyrinth, it seemed to be impossible to escape from the labyrinth unless they fulfilled the conditions to clear the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way we can clear this labyrinth&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yes. It might be so if we had time, but it would take more than a month to clear the labyrinth, even if we do one floor a day. It&rsquo;s not much, but we don&rsquo;t have enough food.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the main problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucius and Raymond had not undergone remodeling surgery, so they needed to eat. Water would be manageable, but there were only 20 days of food left. If the monsters were not released as in the previous hierarchy, there was no way to eat their flesh and blood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this rate, they might not last three weeks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only a day since they had entered, and the situation had already begun to look hopelessly bleak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they did not give up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had one goal in mind: to gather information about their former teacher and friend. If they would have given up at this point, they would not have entered the labyrinth in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, do you think you can trust this handout we were given before we entered?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucius asked Raymond, pointing at his throat. His finger pointed to a necklace, which was given to him by Calgurio before the labyrinthine entry operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed to be a prototype made in the development room, a replica of the revival item that Gadra had brought back. It was said to be able to revive people even if they died in the labyrinth, but Lucius did not trust it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust it. Even if we could be revived, where would we come back to life?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s say we come back to life. If we comes back to life on the same spot, it would be in front of the monster who killed us. They haven&rsquo;t experimented with that yet, have they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. We&rsquo;re going to have to &nbsp;experiment on ourselves. So why hang it around your neck? I heard it was brought back as a bracelet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess that proves that the technology of the empire is still in its infancy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was explained that the size of the replica was increased because it was a hastily made imitation. However, this only served to fuel the distrust between the two men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be a crime to entrust one&rsquo;s life to a counterfeit item.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This item is for the chosen ones only. I highly value you all for your trustworthiness!&rdquo; </span><span class="c5">Calgurio had been using words like this, but it meant that the results have not been confirmed.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Since there was no provision for the soldiers at the end, they would have to wait and see what would happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least, if they had experimental data, they could be trusted, but it was foolish to use themselves as the test subjects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can see what happens if we die first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a laughable joke. At the very least, I&rsquo;m not going to rely on it.&rdquo; Raymond replied pragmatically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyway, the &lsquo;Resurrection Bracelet&rsquo; that this is based on is a power of Demon Lord Ramiris, isn&rsquo;t it? If it&rsquo;s a fake, it might offend the other party even more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Raymond continued, Lucius cowered his shoulders and agreed with him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They came to the conclusion as a matter of course that they would act as if they could not come back to life if they died. The only thing they could rely on was their own ability. So, they stood up with a wry smile on their faces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. We&rsquo;ll go as far as we can. If we don&rsquo;t make it, maybe they&rsquo;ll forgive us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really? Shinji would have laughed, but he said&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that. I&rsquo;d just forgotten about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I know, I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m more afraid of him than I am of the labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, come on, you&rsquo;re showing your true feelings too much just because you haven&rsquo;t been heard. Well, I agree with you though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that right? I was always impressed by Shinji&rsquo;s insensitivity. He was so enthusiastic about this project and yet he ignored it so nicely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Agreed. But that&rsquo;s just like Shinji. That&rsquo;s how he is, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yeah. Shinji is a great guy. He seems like he would survive just fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A smile appeared on both of their faces. They held on to hope in spite of the situation, and clearly saw the path they had to take. With bright smiles on their faces, they began to descend the stairs. They had no idea of what awaited them on the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, hey! Lucius, and Raymond-kun, we need to talk to you about something!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to listen, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You should listen to it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucius and Raymond were surprised to be greeted by Shinji and the others, and they froze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you seem very surprised. Let me ask you to do the same. Can you listen to what I have to say first?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the huge golem towering in front of them, they heard a familiar voice. The voice was undoubtedly Gadra, to whom Lucius and the others felt indebted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&mdash;You&rsquo;re alive, then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I mean&mdash;what does this mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What started next was a battle of persuasion from Gadra and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would take a few more minutes for the two confused people to fall.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Shinji and the others, who had announced their non-participation in the war, also participated in the persuasion. Thanks to their efforts, it seemed that the other side agreed to our proposal without any trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucius and Raymond, Gadra&rsquo;s disciples and Shinji&rsquo;s friends. I had a chance to test their abilities at the 59th floor, but it was Lucius who was the most dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His skill was a foul one. It looked as if he was popping off something with a finger bullet, but what came out of it was a small explosion&mdash;a limited nuclear explosion itself. It was a small reaction, but the power was incredible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unique Skill &lsquo;Fusionist&rsquo;&mdash;the ability to transform matter and fuse it with other matter. A way to use this skill was to transform a small piece of rubble and throw it at an enemy to blow up the enemy itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if a &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; or some other device was used to bounce off the debris, it would explode as soon as it fell to the ground. It could be avoided with a clever dodge, but that would be difficult to do since the gravel used by Lucius was small enough to bounce of his toes. In the first place, it was difficult to even pop off, since it could not react to the transformed gravel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was extremely vicious. It was a method of attack that could engulf the user if they made a mistake, but it had been well studied. I didn&rsquo;t know what kind of training he had gotten, but he seemed to have a perfect sense of detection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then there was Raymond, who was working with Lucius.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raymond&rsquo;s fighting skills were excellent, and his shield was also wonderful. I was fascinated by the way he blocked all the attacks from the front.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raymond&rsquo;s shield was able to block even the shockwaves of the explosions caused by Lucius. They were a good combination of characteristics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no sign that he was disguised as someone else, and we could be sure that it was him. There was also no sign of mental manipulation, and it seemed that the purpose of their visit this time was really to rescue Gadra and Shinji.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both of them seemed trustworthy, and frankly, I was glad to have them on my side. We were going to have them work for Shinji and his group as trainees for a while. I didn&rsquo;t think there was any danger of betrayal, but it was just a precautionary measure. After seeing how they did, I would upgrade them to the same rank as Shinji and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So things were going well on the 60th floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now to take look at the 70th floor&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">About a hundred people were huddled together in a hilly area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, they seemed a little confused, but now, after a day, they had calmed down. They appeared to have set up tents at the top of the hill where they would get a good view. They had sent some people to scout each area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no sign of any immediate movement, and they were very cautious. This calm response was quite impressive, even though their commander had been sent to a different location alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were the bravest among the members of each unit, I would say. I had thought they would be more flustered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, this is just how it&rsquo;s supposed to be. The chain of command should always be clear so that we can be prepared in the event of the loss of the commander.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike me, Benimaru was giving his assessment without holding back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was impossible to conduct operations if the chain of command was disjointed. There always had to be someone in charge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I understood that it was only natural to have a clearly defined command structure, but the people gathered here must have been a collection of people. I secretly admired them despite the fact that we were enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are we all set?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course we are. Even if I&rsquo;m not there, Gobua will be, and there are excellent subordinates under Gobua. Tactical theory is a required course in the Kurenai, so anyone is able to be a commander if necessary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My goodness, such confidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hadn&rsquo;t even studied such a thing either, but when did he learn it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good then. Even so, they&rsquo;re not moving. What do you think they&rsquo;re after?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I left the chain of command to Benimaru and the corps commanders. Since I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered, I decided to bring things back to reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Imperial Guard was encamped at the 70th floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As for their purpose, I think they are checking to see if there are any survivors on the other floors. In that sense, they are unlucky. There are no traces left on the other floors, but it&rsquo;s not the same here.&rdquo; Benimaru replied in a tone of pity for his enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing that, I agreed with him. I knew that there weren&rsquo;t any survivors of the Imperial Guard, but one of their goals was still to find their comrades. Joining up with the survivors and building up their strength made sense as a strategy. But because we knew it was pointless, it was no fun just waiting for them to make a move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Should we let Adalmann attack?&rdquo; I muttered, and Shion nodded her head. She seemed to be quite bored and wanted to make a move. Still, as long as there were forces left in the labyrinth, she had a role to play in protecting me. Even Shion understood this and wanted to get this over with quickly and go out to fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll get much information if we wait any longer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru looked at Shion and spoke with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, the instructions to Adalmann were sent out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My god, watch me in action!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that Shion was not the only one who was looking forward to the battle. Adalmann was also preparing his army to attack the imperial army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalmann and his men had been winning battle after battle. They seemed to be planning to continue their momentum and win the last battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, good luck!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha yes&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My encouragement was the signal to start. Adalmann and the others opened the closed gates with great vigor and set off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then an hour passed.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">There was a startling scene. Only three of the Imperial Army survived. However, the survivors left on our side were Adalmann, Albert, and the death dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was now three against three.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nearly a hundred others had been killed by the dead spirit army, so they had no reinforcements. I had thought that the dead spirit&rsquo;s army would revive in three hours, and the victory would be decided at that time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu, there are some interesting people who have emerged.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm. They fight very well; I&rsquo;d like to fight against them myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo and Shion were unusually forthcoming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such powerful warriors were mixed in with the enemy. Three of them, in fact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of them was a handsome swordsman. He was fighting a close battle with Albert.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another was a beautiful wizard. She was fighting with Adalmann in a magical battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The last was a large warrior. He was holding off the death dragon by himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He must have been like one of the legendary-grade wizards killed by Testarossa, judging from the familiar shining armor he summoned and wore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They must all belong to the same organization, because of their uniform design.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That swordsman, he&rsquo;s a fearsome individual. He&rsquo;s as good as Albert.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fight between Albert and the man was an exchange of divine arts rarely seen. Both were sword and shield fighters of the same school, and their abilities were equal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Benimaru had said, they were evenly matched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seemed to be stronger than the man Testarossa had defeated. Perhaps, I thought, he might be even higher in the pecking order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu, Adalmann doesn&rsquo;t have quite enough faith yet either. The enemy is not going to fall behind someone even with that caliber of magic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I would say so, Diablo. That armor protects him from all kinds of magic, holy or demonic. Adalmann will be at a disadvantage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion&rsquo;s opinion was appropriate. Adalmann had the Extra Skill &lsquo;Holy-Demonic Reversal&rsquo;, but that legendary-grade armor was a foul. In terms of anti-magic, it was almost completely resistant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only way to break it was to use the strongest magic like &ldquo;Disintegration&rdquo;. Even Adalmann could use it, but his opponent would not allow him to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only way is to create an opening with a small magic, and then take aim. However, the current situation was that both parties seemed to be thinking the same thing, and they were competing against each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we could not forget the last man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was also tricky. After all, he was the only one who was fighting against the death dragon. In his case, he had abandoned the idea of victory. He knew that it was impossible to defeat the death dragon because of its tremendous regenerative power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He continued to fight a simple battle, believing in the victory of his comrades. In fact, if he had not done his best to do so, the game would have ended long ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The death dragon was a monster that even Souei could not defeat. Fighting well against it was more troublesome than expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you think will happen?&rdquo; I asked, and I got three different answers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Albert is the better fighter. But he is not as well equipped, so he will lose the battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Adalmann is in too much of a hurry. If he had handled the battle calmly, he would have won by now, but as it is, he is not decisive. If Albert loses in the meantime, the battle will end in defeat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There can only be victory! There is no such thing as defeat!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three of them were very different&mdash;or perhaps Shion was the only one who is wrong?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru and Diablo had similar opinions. They seemed to think that Adalmann and his team would lose. Shion, on the other hand&hellip;thought that fighting spirit would conquer all. It wasn&rsquo;t really an opinion but a wish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, they might lose, huh? Is that bad?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, even if Adalmann and his team lose, there are the other Elite Ten. Besides, I won&rsquo;t lose if I&rsquo;m on the field, so it should be fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course! I can beat them all too, so don&rsquo;t worry, Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was very confident, and Shion was the same as usual. I wanted to ask the reason for her words, but I guess there was no need for an answer. I would just accept her spirit, since it was just Shion&rsquo;s style.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, there is nothing to worry about. The Elite Ten has Veldora-sama&rsquo;s disciple, Zegion. As long as he&rsquo;s around, I&rsquo;m sure even Veldora-sama won&rsquo;t be bothered.&rdquo; Diablo replied with a &ldquo;kufufufu&rdquo; laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was rare for Diablo to praise others. I was a little relieved to hear that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we were talking like this, the battle seemed to be reaching its climax.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalmann&rsquo;s team would have won over time. There was such a hope, but unfortunately, the enemy seemed to have realized it as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was thinking of pushing through, but I guess that&rsquo;s not going to happen. You can be proud in the afterlife that you made me serious!&rdquo; The man facing Albert shouted. I wondered if he still had some tricks up his sleeve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Before you die, allow me to tell you my name. My name is Krishna&hellip;Number 17 of the Imperial Guardians!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am Number 94, Reicha.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Number 35, Bazin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, just as I thought, it was the Imperial Guardians.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had heard about them from Gadra, but it seems that they really did have a great lineup. The guy that Testarossa defeated was ranked 11th, so I guess Krishna and the others were better than him. I had thought that the number was in proportion to the strength, but it seemed not to be the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reicha seemed to be better than Bazin, so I guess I was right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, the battle was a toss-up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like Adalmann&rsquo;s group had been reenergized by Krishna&rsquo;s words. I thought that this would help them to recover, but unfortunately, it did not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The decisive battle was Krishna vs. Albert.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Krishna&rsquo;s sword broke through Albert&rsquo;s cursed sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not so much that Krishna broke it, but that he shattered it. This was completely due to the difference in weapon performance. Even the Curse Sword was an excellent sword made by Kurobee. It was the best weapon for Albert, though ordinary people could not handle it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Krishna&rsquo;s sword was legendary-grade.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By repeating sword fights, he accumulated damage to his opponent&rsquo;s weapon little by little, and finally shattered it all at once. This appeared to be Krishna&rsquo;s specialty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a good thing for him that this turned out to be the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the loss of his weapon, Albert was defeated. Once the vanguard was gone, Adalmann was at a disadvantage. He was surprisingly persistent with his brilliant gestures, not unlike a rear-guard, but he was pushed to the limit and defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, the death dragon was extinguished by a simultaneous attack by the three of them, and the battle was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Albert&rsquo;s sword had not been broken, the battle would have ended differently. Besides, I was not going to ask for the responsibility of the defeat, because it was absurd to ask a magician to compete with a warrior in the physical arts. Rather, I wanted to praise them for their good work in revealing the enemy&rsquo;s tricks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, the battle turned out as Benimaru and Diablo had predicted. They lost two keys, but that was inevitable. I would give them credit for fighting the good fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, we suffered a bitter defeat against Krishna and his three friends.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, we would reflect on what was to be done later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was time to move on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the big screen, we could see the battle scenes at the 79th floor and the battle scene at the 90th floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In both cases, the battle seemed to be reaching their climax.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most extreme one was Kumara, because she had said that the bearded man was her target of vengeance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, Apito&rsquo;s was not so extreme. It was a surprisingly close battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito was as strong as Hinata without magic. This commander-like man was also a very strong fighter against Apito. This guy also happened to be dressed quite handsomely, but he seemed to be as good as Krishna.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now then, it was time to see how the battles would turn out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I held my breath and kept my eyes glued to the big screen.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

The suit design was the same as that of a typical officer&rsquo;s suit, but the fabric was different. Every thread had been carefully selected and mana had been kneaded into the fabric.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a luxury item that was equivalent to the annual salary of a colonel, promising to be comfortable enough to satisfy even the most fashionable Minits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elegance was what Minits was all about. As such, Minits was not happy about this operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In war, one should aim for a victory without fighting by overwhelming the enemy with overwhelming force. Sacrificing lives was out of the question, and when it was happening in their own army, it was no wonder that the commander&rsquo;s ability was questioned. Because of this, Minits had declared that this operation was a failure even before the result.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&hellip;he was not so sure about the results of the operation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I guess it&rsquo;s the sadness of being in the palace service as an official that I can&rsquo;t say such an obvious fact.&rdquo; Minits smiled wryly while he complained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he was not usually the center of attention because Kansas, his subordinate, always stood out, Minits himself was one of the bravest men in the Imperial Army. He did not have a soft heart to give up a war in the middle of a battle because it went against his aesthetics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But then again, Demon Lord Rimuru is quite the cruel man. It&rsquo;s a natural course of action, but to send me, the commander, to a completely different place&hellip; This way, the brave men who gathered this time might all be defeated by a small number. Well, at least Kansas-kun seems to have survived&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits talked to himself, as if he did not care who heard. Despite the content of his words, he seemed to be enjoying himself. It was no wonder that Minits was elated for the first time in a long time. He had never been exposed to such a dangerous situation since he was born. He was in a position where he himself was rarely allowed to even be in the front line.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits was not a maverick, but rather an upper-class individual from an aristocratic family. In fact, he was even more higher-ranked than Calgurio when outside of the military. He was well-connected in the political world and had established his own faction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason why Minits still belonged to the military was because he loved fighting. Minits loved the sight of blood. And now that he had this opportunity, he could go on a rampage to his heart&rsquo;s content. The thought of it made Minits&rsquo;s cheeks loosen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits had been sent to the seventy-eighth floor, one floor above the floor ruled by Apito. The reason for this was to see how Minits fared before analyzing his abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So Minits went to the lower floors, kicking away insects as if he were walking in an uninhabited field.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh dear, I don&rsquo;t like bugs. Just seeing their legs wriggle makes me feel sickened. I&rsquo;ve got to get out of this place as soon as possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a single, arrogant wave of his hand, Minits swung his hand to the side. With that, a gust of wind blew, and the numerous insects were broken up into dust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the power of Minits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was his Unique Skill &lsquo;Oppressor&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This power was simple and clear. From psychological oppression to physical compression, it affected everything in Minits&rsquo;s field of vision. There was no way to escape from it, and everything would disappear in a cloud of dust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, an object could be destroyed with just a glance, without even the need to wave an arm. Minits had been undefeated until now, thanks to this power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How brittle. They&rsquo;re too boring and unresponsive. I wish they would try harder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one could stop Minits now. A swarm of bugs of Over A rank appeared on the seventy-eighth floor, but all of them were killed by Minits. They were no match for him, and the battle was won in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seemed truly invincible. The arrogance of Minits was understandable with this power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits discovers the staircase in a few hours. Going at his own pace as always, he began to take a rest, as if he was simply going camping.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The leather bag on his waist was a high-end magic travel bag. From it, he pulled out a freshly prepared meal to enjoy. The bag even contained a set of bedding with a roof over it to ward off evil spirits, and later Minits went to sleep without a care in the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits even slept without a care in the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then came the next day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits stepped into the seventy-ninth floor with ease, and there he met his true enemy.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The Silent Killer Wasps&mdash;these were the Army Wasps that had attacked Minits, and Minits was the first one to get a glimpse of their abilities. No matter how nasty the monster was, the battle was decided as soon as they entered his sight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, these monsters here are no match for me either. How disappointing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Minits talking so boldly, one of them became furious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Apito.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits showed that he could handle any angle of sneaking up on him. It was obvious that Minits had mastered &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo;. If that was the case, it was pointless to force the Army Wasps any further. So, the queen herself came to the front.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Humans, how dare you say such a thing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? You&rsquo;re a bit too pushy, aren&rsquo;t you? To me, I don&rsquo;t see much of a difference between you and these insects&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At those words, Minits trampled the carcasses of the dead wasps on the ground. This action made Apito&rsquo;s anger flare up even more fiercely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just try it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, the two heroes clashed fiercely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, Minits thought very little of Apito.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not that he was careless, but he thought that his own &lsquo;Oppressor&rsquo; would break Apito into pieces. However, he soon realized that he was being naive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An interference wave was emitted on the line of sight, and Apito became pressured heavily. It was an invisible force of attraction. Minits was able to influence the surrounding matter and give direction to the pulling force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The gravitational pull of a massive star was used to repel matter in all directions. By successfully manipulating the tensile and repulsive forces, Minits was able to explode or compress objects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only way to resist this force was to have a strong body that was not easily moved, or to release a directional wave that canceled out the interference waves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits had never met anyone who could do such a thing. In other words, Minits felt invincible. With such absolute confidence, Minits activated his ability. However, the scene that appeared was different from what Minits had expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Too slow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits had only shattered an afterimage of Apito. Apito had not discovered the true nature of Minits&rsquo;s power, but she had noticed that it was directional. She guessed that she could escape from the area of effect if she moved quickly enough, and she showed a remarkable evasion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufufu, I was right. Do you think you can catch my movements?&rdquo; Apito&rsquo;s movements accelerated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how hard Minits tried to use his &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo;, it was difficult for him to make an effective attack on Apito.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits, however, was inspired.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Interesting. If this wasn&rsquo;t the case, the battle would be too boring!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He unleashed his abilities to the fullest and formed a force field around himself. At the same time, he stepped forward to block Apito&rsquo;s path.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito had no choice but to fall back. The passage of the labyrinth is five meters wide, but if she tried to slip through beside Minits, she would be trapped by the force field.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn, that&rsquo;s nasty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Neither side gave an inch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito&rsquo;s movements had become even more refined and sharp with her training with Hinata. Apito was able to spar against even the leader of Holy Knights, but it was meaningless if she could not get close to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was also dangerous to stop herself from moving. If Apito was caught by the interference wave, she would not be safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a bad idea to come out here. If I retreat to the queen&rsquo;s room, I would be able to fly around more freely. I don&rsquo;t know how long this man&rsquo;s power will last, but the only way to find a chance is to go back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito decided as such. There was no shame in running away. A greedy pursuit for victory was Apito&rsquo;s basic policy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits did not make fun of Apito when she ran away. He saw it as a strategic retreat and, on the contrary, pursued her cautiously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no need to hurry. Rather than pushing too hard at this point, he prioritized to conserve his strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Fighting must be done gracefully. But it is better to struggle in vain than to lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits found Apito beautiful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike the other monsters, he saw Apito as an opponent with aesthetics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was natural for a warrior to choose the battlefield that was favorable to them. Minits did not laugh at this, but rather, appreciated the fact that they were doing their best to fight against him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits chased after Apito, not underestimating his opponent, but thinking of how to corner her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He arrived at a large open space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a chair on a higher platform.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">Apparently, this is the throne where the queen reigns. Fine. It&rsquo;s a good place for you and me to settle our scores.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I dared to accept the enemy&rsquo;s invitation. So let me enjoy myself,&rsquo; Minits thought arrogantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are we done playing tag?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I shall do my best to entertain you. I am the Insect Queen, my name is Apito.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exciting. I am the one who will kill you, Major General Minits-kun. Let&rsquo;s move on to the second round!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, Minits accelerated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was only a wait-and-see move, but it was the real deal. The speed was not faster than Apito&rsquo;s, but not so fast that he would fall behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Apito was not fazed by this. Rising high into the sky, Apito sped up in an attempt to play a trick on Minits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this was within Minits&rsquo;s expectations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How naive. Don&rsquo;t underestimate my power!&rdquo; he shouted after he had unleashed his power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An invisible force field was generated near the ceiling of the domed hall, which caught Apito. Minits has manipulated the force of attraction and attached Apito to the ceiling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;G-GHHHH!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits sneered at the suffering Apito.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmmm, are you in pain? I&rsquo;d like to crush you right away, but you are a little too strong. I could&rsquo;ve crushed any ordinary monster at this distance,&rdquo; he said, stepping closer to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits&rsquo;s power was proportional to the distance. His action was based on the idea that the closer he got, the more pressure he would exert on Apito, and thus, he could crush and kill even a big opponent like Apito.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, now that Apito had been captured, there was no need for Minits to exert his power in all directions. By concentrating his power only on Apito, he would be able to achieve a sure victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">It was a harder fight than I expected, but I guess she is my enemy after all. However, as a reward for entertaining me this far, I will bury her without making her suffer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits had no taste for antagonizing his enemies. He only wanted the elation of battle and the thrill of victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why he tried to show mercy to Apito out of pure goodwill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare underestimate me, human! I said I was going to give my all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a cry, Apito, who had been suffering under the pressure, flew into the air once again. Even with her wings torn, limbs bent, and wounds all over her body, Apito&rsquo;s will to fight remained undimmed. Apito was also greedily pursuing victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama is watching this battle, too. It&rsquo;s my job to reveal the enemy&rsquo;s hand, no matter how bad things may get!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukukuku, interesting. You think you can see through my power? I&rsquo;ll let you die first!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits once again generated a force field centered on himself. Repulsion and attraction, repelling those who try to approach him, and at the same time manipulating the flow of force to sew them to the ground. Minits set out to finish Apito off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito, on the other hand, did not stay down forever. She flew faster than Minits&rsquo;s visual perception and kept her distance in order to avoid being caught by the interference wave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a pity that Apito had no means of attack, but her opponent&rsquo;s power was not inexhaustible. There must be a limit at some point, and Apito continued to wait for that moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Would Minits&rsquo;s limit come first, or would Apito run out of power first?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, a battle of endurance began.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only after a few hours had passed that the situation began to change.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito followed Hinata&rsquo;s teachings and continued to try every possible means of attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her broken limbs were gone, and she continued to fly around desperately with her torn wings, looking for an opening in Minits. She sent poisonous needles flying at his blind spots and vibrated her wings to release shock blades. She called all the Army Wasps under her command to attack Minits from all directions. All of these actions were aimed at finding the point where Minits&rsquo;s interference power would be weakened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By these actions, the Army Wasp were completely wiped out. Even her own subordinates were called by Apito. It was impossible not to be frustrated. Even so, Apito let her men continue their suicide attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, Minits was far from unharmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The expensive suit he used to wear was now in tatters. His elegance had been abandoned, and desperate evasive maneuvers could be seen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufufufu. You look tired.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;You, too. I&rsquo;m honestly surprised that you&rsquo;ve stuck with it this long.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you, didn&rsquo;t I? It doesn&rsquo;t matter how bad things get, as long as I win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree. But I&rsquo;m the one who will win!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both of them had great patience for showing a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were so exhausted that they could barely stand. In spite of such a situation, they showed off their strength to each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your strength is great. I admit it, but you are far from perfect. I declare that I will kill you with my next attack!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These were the words of Apito, floating in the air, to Minits. Her face was covered in her own blood, but she had a beautiful, radiant smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits looks at her with narrowed eyes and replied with the corners of his mouth turned up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. Then, I promise to make your life easier with my next blow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both opponents had little strength left in them. They declared that they would decide the match with the next blow because that was all they had left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both of them began to move with all their strength, without thinking of what would come next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito predicted the movement of Minits&rsquo;s interference wave and changed her trajectory just before the attack. Apito was planning to exceed the reaction of Minits by hitting him with her body at a speed faster than the speed of sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits knew this, too. The question was to what extent that Apito knew his power. She would have to deal with the invisible interference waves depending on whether or not they were accurately detected when they were triggered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits believed in himself that she wouldn&rsquo;t see them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle was decided in that one moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the moment Minits released his power, Apito changed her orbit. However, this was due to her own intuition, as Minits had expected, and she did not see the interference wave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits laughed at his victory, and Apito laughed at her death.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 789.13px; height: 1122.53px;"><img alt="" src="images/image26.jpg" style="width: 789.13px; height: 1122.53px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right. Apito&rsquo;s attack was, from the very beginning, predicated on her death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over, Queen Apito.&rdquo; Minits exclaimed happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito opened her mouth wide and tried to shoot out her trump card, just as she felt an invisible surge of power enveloping her entire body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Queen of Needles&mdash;Apito bet her life and released her most powerful poison needle. It was not created by her spirit, but by a part of Apito&rsquo;s own body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its hardness easily penetrated even a magisteel. Apito was convinced that a poisoned needle, if fired at close range with all her power, would penetrate Minits&rsquo; force field.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Minits&rsquo; power compressed on Apito, and the poison needle released by Apito penetrated his force field and came close him&mdash;the time of the showdown had come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The result was that both Minits and Apito were defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito was dissatisfied that she had not achieved a complete victory, but she was still happy to have done her part.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Death was not the end. In this labyrinth, one could be resurrected as many times as you wished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito disappeared from the labyrinth, waiting for the time of resurrection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits, upon seeing this, decided to rest quietly until his wounds healed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits was still alive, though his heart was shattered by the current attack. Minits was not the kind of man that would die from such an attack, and the wound would heal with time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits was filled with a sense of contentment at being able to surrender to an unprecedented battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a great battle. I wish I could taste more, so I can prove that I am the best&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits thought as such in the aftermath of the battle. He was bloodthirsty, but he was not satisfied just yet. Instead, Minits&rsquo;s instinct was telling him that he wanted to fight a stronger fighter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Challenge and surpass your limits. Believing that by doing so, they would become stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if in response to Minits&rsquo;s desire, something unusual happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another person&rsquo;s voice echoed out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;That was a great battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The voice exuded the air of a champion who reigned over others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My name is Zegion, and you are qualified to fight me. If you want it, come to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if guided by his voice, Minits reopened his closed eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ahead of his line of sight, he could see the dark vortex that had appeared before he even realized it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Are you going to entertain me? In that case, I must accept your invitation&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Undeterred by his unhealed body, Minits stood up. And then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Undaunted, Minits set off to go where he was invited.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

She had lost her mother and her friends because she had been powerless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her great mother was a youma, as powerful as a demon lord. But she was a gentle youma, who would never have been hostile to human beings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, the king of demons who was hostile to humans calls himself &ldquo;Phantom King&rdquo;. They were of a different power from the ten demon lords, and they were a threat to mankind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this had nothing to do with youma village.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demons were demons. Youma were youma, and the Phantom King was just a king of a tribe whose race was not even known.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the existence of Kumara and her friends must have been unforgivable to the human race, or rather, to the empire. Youma village was used as a demonstration sacrifice to show the might of the nation to the subjects of the empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The location of the &ldquo;youma township&rdquo; was along the border between Demon Lord Clayman&rsquo;s territory and the eastern empire. The entrance to the other world was hidden between the foot of the mountain on the Jistav side and the forest on the Imperial side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The blessings of the forests, the delicacies of the mountains, and a mild climate. It was not a paradise of everlasting spring, but a very comfortable place to live.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had also been careless because they were along the border and could not be attacked. Demon Lord Clayman and the Empire had signed a secret non-aggression pact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This peaceful situation had paralyzed their sense of crisis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, armed soldiers attacked the &ldquo;youma township&rdquo; without any sign of them. And in spite of the resistance of the warriors who were defending the village, all of their comrades were killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mother, the previous nine heads, also lost her life at that time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was powerful, but she hated fighting. Even though the opponent was human, she could not win against a professional soldier who specialized in fighting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then there was the man she would never forget.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s called Kansas, I remember. The name of the man who was my mother&rsquo;s, and everyone&rsquo;s killer&mdash;&rdquo; Kumara shouted in a vindictive tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That bearded man with the nasty smile was an enemy whom Kumara could not be satisfied with even by killing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a reward to Clayman, Kansas had offered Kumara, a nine-head child, which he had captured alive. And then he put all the treasures in the village into their own pockets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had told his subjects that the threat of &ldquo;youma village&rdquo; had passed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That threat was a criminal act of their own making. In order to let the people know that &ldquo;youma village&rdquo; was dangerous, they had selected some of the residents and merchants in the neighborhood, and cruelly killed them off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those frightened subjects treated them as if they were champions&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Clayman, of all people, who had told her this backstory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The more Kumara&rsquo;s resentment was directed towards humans, the stronger she became as youma, and her &ldquo;status&rdquo; as a monster would increase.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because Kumara was a valuable &ldquo;nine-headed&rdquo; youma beast, Clayman considered her to be an asset. Thanks to this, she was able to survive as a pet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara had accumulated resentment and increased her power, just as Clayman had predicted. Kumara was chosen as one of the five fingers of Clayman&rsquo;s army, the thumb finger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fate had taken a further turn, and Kumara was picked up by Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was there that she remembered what happiness was, and her emotional wounds were healed through contact with the children&hellip;and it was then that she met her bitter enemy once again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you. I will tear you apart with all my might.&rdquo; Kumara muttered and waited for Kansas to come.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, there was Colonel Kansas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He did not show any sign of being affected even though he was sent to an unknown place all alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kansas was a hard-working soldier. He was the epitome of the meritocracy of the empire and had risen to his current position with just his fists.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was a man of careerism, with no regard for any wrongdoings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He considered the &ldquo;youma village&rdquo; incident as a legitimate act to strengthen his position and power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the sake of great peace, a few sacrifices were insignificant. He did not even feel guilty about his actions, believing them to be a necessary evil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, despite the problems of his human nature, there was no doubt about his ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he had participated in the battle for the top rank, he would have been selected as one of the top hundred. The reason why this had not happened was that Kansas was not interested in joining the Imperial Guardians.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was putting his own interests above the loyalty to Emperor Rudra. Above all, Kansas had a superior whom he trusted with all his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That superior was Major General Minits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was not only equal to Kansas in terms of ability, but he was also the man who had taken an interest in Kansas and helped to pull him up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Kansas&rsquo; goal in life to bring Minits to the top of the army and to take full power under him, and he had been working hard and dreaming of that day ever since.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was why he saw this invasion as a great opportunity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s failure was obvious to all, and he would be punished for it. Rather, he had to work together with Minits to unify the Armored Corps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By rescuing the soldiers left behind in the labyrinth and selling them favors, he would be able to quickly increase the numbers in a new faction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Calgurio would no longer bee needed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu, how ridiculous. How can he be so naive as to think that political power alone will allow him to become the head of the army?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kansas ridiculed his superiors as much as he liked because no one was listening. Then, he calmly walked away to search for his surviving subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a day had passed, Kansas began to think that something was wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Putting aside the fact that there were forests and deserts in the labyrinth, not a soul was to be seen. On the contrary, not even a monster was to be found.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every floor of the labyrinth was eerily quiet, and nothing was happening, making him feel foolish for being so vigilant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Kansas was not the kind of person to be caught off guard by such things, but the fact that his &lsquo;danger detector&rsquo; did not respond at all made him feel more anxious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmmm. I guess they don&rsquo;t want to catch me off guard. If that&rsquo;s the case, are they concentrating their forces?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kansas&rsquo; insight was fearsome. He was right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, I&rsquo;m so glad to hear that they are giving me such a welcome! Well then, I&rsquo;ll feel free to visit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That boldness of Kansas was one of his virtues. He decided that he could kick out any traps and began sprinting toward the lower floors at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At a speed that left the wind behind him, Kansas ran. With a single kick to the ground, he traveled several meters and reached the stairs in a blink of an eye.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few hours later&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The gates of a vast mansion stood before Kansas&rsquo; eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was an opulent structure that could intimidate its visitors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, without a sound, the gate opened, and the battle began.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

It&rsquo;s a familiar face. Are you the little fox from back then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You remember me? That&rsquo;s a great honor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How could I forget?&mdash;Your mother helped me to get ahead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sparks flew between them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was no hallucination. It was a physical phenomenon caused by the violent clash between the haki and fighting aura.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re saying that so easily!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha! I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re all right. But you survived only because I sold you to Clayman. You should thank me for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you.&rdquo; Kumara howled with an even greater fury.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In response, the white monkey Byakuren emerged. As if to show his dignity as the leader of the eight, he launched a series of club attacks on Kansas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A survivor of youma? Then I, too, will show you something interesting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as he said this, Kansas summoned a monster without any preliminary movement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a monkey covered with black fur.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re my mother&rsquo;s servant!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was definitely one of Kumara&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s tailed beasts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you miss it? Play with him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The dark monkey was also a gentle magic beast. Kumara remembered playing with him. And yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The dark monkey with whom she had such fond memories&hellip;had a vicious look on his face&hellip;and he was baring his fangs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Have you forgotten me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara&rsquo;s voice didn&rsquo;t reach him. The dark monkey screamed &ldquo;Keeeee!&rdquo; and overwhelmed Byakuren.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use! That monkey has become my loyal servant. He doesn&rsquo;t remember anything about you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not taking part in the fight, Kansas pulled a cigarette from his pocket and put it in his mouth. He lit it, inhaled the smoke, and smiled at Kumara.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you do to the Dark Monkey, you son of a bitch?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? What did I do to the dark monkey? Do you suspect me of something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reply was like a mockery to Kumara.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Realizing that Kansas was not going to answer seriously, Kumara made her next move in anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Moon rabbit Gett, black rat Kokuso, come out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara&rsquo;s tail turned into magic beasts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was now three against one. The Kumara side had the upper hand once again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that was only for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come out, dark rabbit, and dark rat!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To the surprise of everyone, Kansas even summoned magic beasts in time with Kumara.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara could not hide her surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-How&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you surprised? But so am I. I didn&rsquo;t think you would be able to summon three tailed beasts when you are just a kid. Clayman seems to have trained you well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was confident in his attitude, but there is a reason for it. The magic beasts summoned by Kansas were stronger than the eight under Kumara.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How troublesome. Let&rsquo;s end the fun now.&rdquo; As soon as he said so, Kansas added more magic beasts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way! A dark tiger and a dark snake!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Comparing the strength of each of these magic beasts, Kansas&rsquo; magic beasts were stronger. And that&rsquo;s as it should be. These magic beasts were the faithful guardians of the previous nine-heads who belonged to Kumara&rsquo;s mothers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Five such powerful magic beasts. They had lost their gentle and calm temperament from those days, and were now standing in front of her, unleashing their ferocious instincts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kansas thought that he had won at this point. No matter how much Kumara, a young fox cub, had grown up, she could only control three tailed beasts at most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Kumara&rsquo;s mother could only produce five tailed beasts. He had thought that Kumara, who had lived only a few hundred years, would never be able to produce such power, even if she became a fox who had lived for thousands of years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why Kansas spoke to her arrogantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be happy to keep you as my lapdog if that&rsquo;s what you are now. You can switch over from Demon Lord Rimuru to me. I&rsquo;ll spare your life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His tone of voice was more like an order than a negotiation. It was a statement based on the certainty of his victory. But Kansas was fatally mistaken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara became furious. Her smile became deeper and more beautiful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a funny guy. You must have prepared to make me so angry, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She asked, but no answer was needed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara unleashed her tailed beasts&mdash;all eight of them. Those that appeared were thunder tiger Raikou, winged snake Yoda, sleeping sheep Mink, flame bird Enchou, and mirror dog Igami.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How is that possible? Eight of them? You&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the first time Kansas showed agitation, but it was only for a moment. He immediately regained his composure and smiled wryly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I commend you that you have grown so much to the point that you surprised me. But I still have the advantage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How terrible. In that case, I&rsquo;ll say no more. I&rsquo;ll rip off your hands and feet and hang them in my room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The negotiations were over. And so began the battle of eight against five.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The eight were more advantageous in terms of numbers, but the opponents were elites who had served their predecessors for a long time. The amount of magicules they had accumulated was different. Above all, their experience is different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Byakuren was not weak by any means, but the dark magic beasts were so strong that they overturned the numerical disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As time passed, the Eight beasts began to be pushed back. But Kumara still did not give up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Observing Kansas, she noticed one thing. The magic beasts summoned by Kansas were individually very powerful. Moreover, they seem to have lost their memories completely, but they also seemed to have retained their rationality. They responded quickly to Kansas&rsquo;s instructions and dealt with the eight beasts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conversely, this meant that Kumara had a chance to win if she could defeat Kansas, the leader. Besides, Kumara still had another trick up her sleeve. All she has to do was recall the eight members back to her and become her true self.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara judged that if she did so, she would be superior to Kansas. Kumara, therefore, analyzed the war situation without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what about Kansas? He looked as if things were going fine, but he was actually on the edge of his limits. There was a reason why Kansas was leading the dark magic beasts. Kansas&rsquo;s power was the secret.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unique Skill &lsquo;Marauder&rsquo;&mdash;that was the power that Kansas possessed. This power was meaningless by itself. It was a power that had no effect. Kansas first became aware of this power when he was a child. He killed a dog owned by a friend of his in revenge for a quarrel over a trivial matter. Then, he was able to summon a dark dog.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This alone was only a little useful in battle, but the real value of this power lay elsewhere. This was revealed when Kansas joined the army and defeated the guerrillas on the frontier. He was able to summon a &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; that was as powerful as the ones he had killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Kansas realized. He could only summon the darkness from those he had killed. This meant that the more he killed, the stronger he would become. Skill and the shape of the person he killed could be reproduced perfectly. It was a very versatile Skill, useful for disguising oneself in an undercover mission. But there was a limit. His power did not add up all of the power of those he killed, but was only up to the power of the strongest opponent he had killed. If that were possible, it would mean that Kansas could control an army by himself. There was no such universalism, and there was a limit to the value of Kansas&rsquo; existence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara saw through it correctly. Therefore, there was no need to panic even if the current situation was unfavorable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand. You have reached your limit, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then so what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re controlling those dark beats, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Because all I have to do is kill you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was Kumara&rsquo;s analysis of the war situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although the forces of the subordinates were in competition, the commanders of both sides were not participating in the battle. If Kumara took out Kansas, he would not be able to give orders to the magical beasts of darkness. And if Kumara and Kansas were to be compared, Kumara was far superior in the amount of magicules.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Your death will not be easy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as she announced this, Kumara vanished from the scene and took Kansas&rsquo; back in an instant. She then tried to slit his neck with her outstretched claws.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kansas responded with a show. He admitted that Kumara was right, but still maintained a relaxed attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s scary. If I had known you would grow up to be this big, I should have killed you at that time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukuku, don&rsquo;t be so angry. I&rsquo;ll show you something funny in return for your apology.&rdquo; Saying so, Kansas laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, Kansas&rsquo;s &lsquo;Marauder&rsquo; only had the power to summon those he had killed. There was a limit to how many he could summon, and the power that Kansas himself had gained was only as strong as the strongest person he had ever defeated. However, Kansas was hiding a secret trick. Without hesitation, he decided to disclose it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why do you think I sold you to Clayman? Why do you think I gave you up even though I knew you would be a great asset? It was because&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had more power than Kumara, and he could have easily tamed and nurtured Kumara.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kansas obliterated the magic beasts of darkness and summoned a single giant beast to take their place. This was the source of Kansas&rsquo; power and the reason he did not need Kumara.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Th-that, it looks like&hellip;Mother?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A dark fox appeared. It had five thick tails and four thin ones. With a total of nine tales, it was the mistress of the &ldquo;youma village&rdquo;. However, her appearance had become a disaster, and there was no trace of the kindly face she had when she was alive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haaaaaahaha! That&rsquo;s right. This is your mother. But by being manipulated by me, she&rsquo;s learned to wield her maniacal power to the fullest. It&rsquo;s wonderful. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to see it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gentle nature became a curse, and she showed mercy to her enemies. Therefore, even though she was as powerful as a demon lord, she had lived a modest life, hiding and hiding, minimizing her interactions with the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such was the case with the previous generation. Now, through the hands of Kansas, her true power was unleashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you even mock the dead?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not. It&rsquo;s respect. I&rsquo;m trying to put it to good use, and I want you to thank me for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The dark nine-head that Kansas summoned flares up at the sight of Kumara. There was no emotion in her eyes. She only took one look at Kumara with the eyes of an enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mother&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kill her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Following an order, the nine heads moved. The next moment, the dark tailed beasts united in a single all-out blow, cleaving the eight heads in half.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yoda, Igami&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two that were too late to move were seriously wounded by the blow and returned to Kumara&rsquo;s tail. That&rsquo;s how powerful it was. It was obvious that the eight beasts had no chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha! Isn&rsquo;t this funny? This power is the reason I don&rsquo;t need you. But with all those tails, you&rsquo;re better than your mother. What you lack in experience, I make up for in experience. Kukuku, I&rsquo;m glad I let you live. If I get ahold of you here too, then I&rsquo;ll have even more power!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kansas exulted. He had no intention of losing. He possessed the strongest nine heads, and an equally strengthened self. With such a strong force, there was no way he could be defeated by the little fox. Kansas is convinced of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kansas considered even Clayman to be of a lower rank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had thought that he could defeat the new Demon Lord Rimuru only after he had mastered the power of the Nine Heads, which was comparable to that of the Demon Lords. He inwardly taunted Clayman thinking that it wasn&rsquo;t such a big deal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Kumara in front of him showed that she could use as many as eight tailed beasts. Though their individual strength was not so great that they had only lost due to their inexperience. It was hard to imagine what they would become when they grew up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m so lucky. I&rsquo;ll kill her here and dye her corpse with my power!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This would greatly increase the power of Kansas. A new demon lord could do nothing in the face of that power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thinking of this, Kansas began to attack Kumara.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara, who had been standing still, shook her head and muttered to herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I lose my cool, I will lose. I forgot Hinata-sama&rsquo;s lesson, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she caught the man and the beast slowly approaching in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone, come back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In response to her words, the tailed beasts were sucked into Kumara&rsquo;s tail as light. Kumara&rsquo;s nine tails began to glow with a dazzling radiance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man and the beasts were now in front of her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Kumara does not panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was inexperienced with tailed beasts. She could admit it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Kumara herself was not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had a good teacher and a group of friends. A wonderful environment. All of them had helped Kumara to improve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara gently clenched the sharp claws of her right and left hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told you my name yet. My name is Kumara.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, your name&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am the &ldquo;nine head&rdquo; Kumara.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claws clenched and the sound of shattering knives rang out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Kansas hurriedly moved away, Kumara smiled at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to remember. I was going to give you a slow and horrible death, but that was too much for me. Therefore&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No sooner had she finished her words had the dark beast become shattered into pieces. The previous nine heads was torn to pieces by Kumara&rsquo;s hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Kansas exclaimed involuntarily at this shocking event.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The strongest piece in his hand for the battle was now vanishing right before his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike in a summoning, Kansas&rsquo;s &lsquo;Marauder&rsquo; only formed &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; based on the corpse. Therefore, a vanished individual could not be recalled again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara had now regained her stolen mother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-You&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I could&rsquo;ve made you suffer if I were stronger. It&rsquo;s a shame, but you&rsquo;re done here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-Wait&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t listen to that kind of nonsense. Kansas&rsquo;s pleas fell on deaf ears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Farewell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The end of those words was the end of Kansas&rsquo;s life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The nine-tailed slash&mdash;slashes from all directions by the shining tails cut Kansas into tiny pieces and killed him without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px;"><img alt="KUMARA SPLAT" src="images/image20.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was Kumara. A woman of beauty and a ruthless will of steel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She longed for what she had lost, but she had no regrets. She understands that death was death and was irrevocable. That is why it was important not to let anything be taken from her any longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Youma Village had been lost, but now Kumara had a new home to return to. Making sure that it was not taken away was the most important thing to Kumara now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wanted to give you all a chance for revenge, but please forgive me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so, vengeance had been taken.

Golden streaks ran through his jet-black exoskeleton. Shining like red jade was a single sword-like horn extending from the center of his forehead. Beneath that horn was a pair of crimson eyes that never closed. They took in information from the surroundings and continued to process it in the brains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His exoskeleton had been modified according to the tastes of his master, Rimuru. Rimuru&rsquo;s cells and magisteel had reinforced his missing body parts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was now well accustomed to it and it had become a part of himself. He had developed an unparalleled property of what might be called adamantite, combining strength beyond that of a diamond with the flexibility of a living creature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was natural armor, equivalent to legendary-grade armor. But even so, his strength was not derived from his exoskeleton. The essence of his strength was derived from his instinct to fight greedily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A new prey had come before him. Everything was as he wished. He was the absolute master of the labyrinth. The strongest guardian of the labyrinth&hellip;the Insect Kaiser Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion thought to himself. There are those who were qualified to fight him. That&rsquo;s why he was calling them over. Making them come to this dark space. Those who had reached this floor were lucky. They could die with the dignity of a human being and the pride of a worthy opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the end of the stairs leading to the 80th floor of the labyrinth, there was a room where one could rest. To show that there were no traps, the room was open with no door. At the end of the room, one could see a luxurious door. Beyond that door was the room for the boss of this floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was exactly this room that Minits found at the end of the dark vortex.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room was dimly lit, and there were fruits and drinks on the table. It was also furnished with utilitarian commodities and comfortable chairs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were already a few first-timers in the room. Minits looked at them lightly and tried to recall if he remembered any of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Minits, the people who had been sitting in the chairs talking with each other stood up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Major General Minits, are you all right? I belong to the &lsquo;Augmented Legion&rsquo; 26th Division&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough. This labyrinth is not a lukewarm place where a single soldier or low-ranking officer can survive. I fully understand that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits held up one hand to hold his opponent&rsquo;s greeting. If they were senior officers or above, he remembered their names and affiliations. Minits, however, had no memory of those in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That meant only one thing&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this labyrinth, even those of Over A rank would have had a hard time surviving. At least, against the majin of insects that Minits just defeated, there was no way they could survive even if they gathered their numbers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even among the superhumans who had broken through the wall, it was impossible for even a handful of them to take on a person of that class. Such a powerful person would not be content with such a lowly position, and that is why Minits had a guess as to the identity of those in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ha! You are correct, sir. I am Krishna, 17th rank in the Imperial Guardians.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am Bazin, Number 35.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Reicha, Number 94.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. So, you are the knight escort of the emperor. You have been infiltrating our army as spies for the current operation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I might have my doubts even if you answer so honestly, but that&rsquo;s all right for now. Let&rsquo;s talk about the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We were discussing whether this would be a good idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm-hmm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if taking it for granted that his prediction was correct, Minits proceeded with his story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that they were being watched was not funny, but the important thing was to survive. What was needed here was not rank or position, but strength. Therefore, Minits made a decision to give priority to a meaningful discussion, without questioning Krishna and the others&rsquo; positions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what happened to all the others?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. We were sent to the floor where the &lsquo;mighty king&rsquo; was reported to be.&rdquo; Krishna replied on behalf of the three.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits urged them onward with a glance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We were facing the evil King of the Undead with only ninety-six men without commanders. In that battle, the rest of us&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable. They were all one-hundred-thousand warriors who could act on their own without orders. They may not have been as good as you, but they were the best of our army.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The mission was to rescue the imperial army. All of them, even the most junior soldiers, were A-ranked, for all possible contingencies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits urged them on in a stern tone of voice, saying &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe they were all wiped out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He was a fearsome monster. And the dead spirit knight who guarded him was also a top-notch swordsman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They killed everyone in that group except the three of us. I don&rsquo;t have an answer to the criticism that we should have revealed ourselves earlier. But a dead dragon, a dead sword saint, and the Immortal King. It&rsquo;s a miracle that we survived.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bazin interrupted the conversation between Krishna and Minits. His words were full of anger, and he seemed to regret in disappointment. It was obvious to everyone that he meant what he said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being rude to the Major General, Bazin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, Reicha-san&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t care. This labyrinth is dangerous. We can help each other here to survive, regardless of our status.&rdquo; Minits verbally offered to cooperate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the other party was the Emperor&rsquo;s guard, he had no complaints about his ability. This was no time for quarreling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We are encouraged by your offer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Krishna was well aware of Major General Minits of the Armored Corps. It was no wonder that he belonged to the Emperor&rsquo;s Imperial Guardians, and there was no reason for him to refuse their cooperation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Krishna and the other three and Minits nodded at each other silently. What happened after they left this labyrinth was something they could think about when we got out. This was the moment when the four of them came to a common understanding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, how did Minits-sama get here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was dealing with a group of Army Wasps.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Army Wasps&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most dangerous monster in the world. They were so dangerous that they were dealt with quickly after they were discovered and were unknown to the general public. If they were known, they would have killed almost everyone, so in any case, they were unknown to the public.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Such a dangerous monster, all by yourself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t met any of my colleagues other than you and the others since I entered this labyrinth. In my case, after defeating the Army Wasps and the queen-like majin, I was called by a voice. I found myself in this place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, I see&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Krishna was impressed by Minits&rsquo;s quick reply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the Queen Wasp had turned into a majin, her power was unimaginable. It was probably as strong as a low-ranking demon lord. It was encouraging to see how strong Minits was, to have disposed of such an opponent along with all her subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Krishna was so nervous that he had not noticed before, but Minits had wounds all over his body. He also had a large hole in his chest, which told Krishna of a fierce battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, are you badly hurt?&rdquo; Reicha asked, and Minits laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have prepared some medicine. After a few more days of rest, I will regain my strength. But more importantly, what route did you take to get to this room?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits was in charge. Although they were treated as equals, Minits still had the upper hand over Krishna and the others. Minits took the lead in sharing the information they had obtained. It turned out that the labyrinth had a distorted structure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reality was so different from the previous reports that there was nothing to base it on. It was as if they were groping their way through the labyrinth, and the outlook for the future was bleak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What the heck is going on here? We were dealing with the boss of the 60th floor as reported, weren&rsquo;t we? Why didn&rsquo;t Demon Lord Rimuru make us conquer them one by one?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he had, it would have taken them longer to conquer the bosses. Bazin spoke up with doubts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it would have been the right thing to do if it would have only exhausted us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits answered the question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy. You&rsquo;ve heard the rumors about the labyrinth, haven&rsquo;t you? If you challenge it, you can come back to life as long as you wear the bracelet. What do you think would happen if that were applied to monsters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo; Bazin cried out in dismay, and Krishna and Reicha took over Minits&rsquo;s words with a bitter look on their faces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying that they can wear out the imperial army by accepting more and more of us, rather than letting us take longer to attack?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And once we&rsquo;re in, we can&rsquo;t get out. It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re asking to destroy us one by one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, it was because we were confident of our strength in the labyrinth. I also made a proposal to Calgurio-sama. He told me that we should seize the bases for resurrection and kill them every time they come back to life. His opinion was reasonable, so I had no choice but to retreat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits also bitterly told them that it was a mistake.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, the Imperial Army had deployed more than 500,000 generals. This was the most foolish thing they could have done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the result of misjudging the strength of the Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinates, who were guarding the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And did you find any survivors?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was all that was needed to know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They needed to assume that they were the only survivors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much that I don&rsquo;t believe it rather that I don&rsquo;t </span><span class="c2">want</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to believe it. If we survive and can make it back to the surface, we must retreat as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;His Majesty will be angry, but we have no choice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one objected to this conclusion. The policy was thus decided, and the next step was to ascertain the current situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, what is this place?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The drinks and fruits here are not tainted. We don&rsquo;t intend to take advantage of our enemies&hellip;but it&rsquo;s obvious that they&rsquo;re intending to host us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And that door. I pushed and pulled, but it wouldn&rsquo;t open. You see those numbers above it? We were talking about it until you came in, thinking it was a countdown.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the door at the back of the room, an inexpressible, thick demonic presence seemed to be drifting in the air. Above the door that Bazin indicated, there was indeed a number displayed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was clear that it represented the time. The number was 200. This must mean that the door would open in a little over three hours.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Coincidentally, this was the same amount of time it would take for Minits to return to a state of perfect health.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits let out a sigh of relief, not believing this to be a coincidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems that the enemy intends to fight us when we are in perfect condition. It may not be fair, but at least they are waiting for me to recover.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And are they waiting for a few of us to come together, instead of challenging us one by one?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That must mean that they are very confident of their own strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re really taking advantage of us and His Excellency Minits, who buried the wight king&rsquo;s group.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll be lenient here. Kansas will be here soon, and the more time we can buy, the better off we&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. We have to have more forces. If Kansas-dono joins us, it will not be impossible to break through this labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. As for the keys, we have seven of them so far. Minits, you have one too, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reicha took out a medal and showed it to the audience. There were ten crystals in it, and seven of them had lights on them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That medal was the key to challenge the king of the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. To challenge the king of the labyrinth, you must defeat the Elite Ten. By the time we entered the labyrinth, we had already obtained four keys.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. It seems that not only the dead spirit king, but also the dead spirit knight I defeated was of the Elite Ten.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. Now, if Kansas wins and gets the key, we will have at least nine keys, including the one from the other side of this door. It&rsquo;s a faint glimmer of hope, but we have a clear path.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they could go back down to the ground right now, they would swear never to enter this place again. That was how bad this labyrinth was. But that was a wish that would never come true. It was impossible to get out of here alive unless they defeated the enemy. They had prepared for that long ago when they entered the labyrinth. The only thing left for them to do was to keep pushing forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, Minits and the others rested while awaiting the arrival of Kansas. They needed to recover from their fatigue here in order to improve their chances of winning. Even though there was no danger of poisoning, no one touched the foodstuffs that had been prepared. Each of them took out their personal food and made what might be their last energy boost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All for the sake of survival.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With less than three minutes remaining, Minits and the others stood up. He checked the medal and was disappointed to see that the light had not increased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Kansas may have been defeated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No reinforcements showed signs of coming, even after waiting for more time. Minits and abandoned any naive expectations. He calmly assessed the situation and gave the right orders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time. About time that we get ready too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The others of the Emperor&rsquo;s guard nodded silently. They took out their pendants and chanted a small password.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;Open!&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without any loss of time, a torrent of light gushed out, completing their arming. The three Imperial Guardians were joined by Major General Minits, the most powerful of the Armored Corps. All four of them were the best of the Empire. With this lineup, conquering the labyrinth was not a dream. Yes, everyone believed so.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the time of destiny had arrived. The time count advanced, and the time remaining was zero. At the same time, the front door opened. Everyone was prepared. Without hesitation, they entered through the doors and threw themselves into the battle for survival.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beyond the door was true darkness. It was a dark space where no light shone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reicha hurriedly activated the light elemental magic: Floor Light. What emerged drew gasps from everyone. It was a vast wasteland, where the corpses of imperial soldiers were piled high in a heap. At its peak was a single monster meditating in a cross-legged position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Zegion. He was not seated directly on the corpses, but was slightly hovering in the air. Such a scene proved that Zegion had a highly sophisticated control of his mana.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, a low, resonant voice sounded throughout, &ldquo;I welcome all ye brave ones.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that single remark from Zegion, the atmosphere swelled, overwhelming the space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits was convinced. This monster was the one who had invited him to this place, the Demon Lord Rimuru himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why he asked the question: &ldquo;Are you&hellip;? Are you Demon Lord Rimuru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had read the report that Demon Lord Rimuru was slime. But what could this mean? Since he was slime, perhaps it was not surprising that he could change into any form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">More than anything else, what this monster radiated was an overwhelming Demon Lord Haki. Minits thought that this was the proof that this monster was actually Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, his comment only served to anger Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You dare to mistake me&hellip;for the great Demon Lord Rimuru-sama&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A feeling off intense rage enveloped the space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At such a violent reaction, Minits realized his blunder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My name is Zegion and I am but one of the Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten. You foolish ones, earth-crawling mongrels who deserve death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite his fiery passion, Zegion spoke up rather blandly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is only one way for you to survive: to defeat me. Burn your lives, and struggle against me with all your might!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he spoke arrogantly in the face of these imperial champions, there was no arrogance in his tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was made clear to Minits that Zegion was speaking the truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only way to change Zegion&rsquo;s words would be to show him their strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to give it our all, guys!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, the battle began.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Benimaru and I were staring at the scene on the big screen. The images that had earlier been showing the labyrinth were now silent. It meant that the Imperial Army generals had died on all the other floors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the sheer content of what we had just seen was too much for words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That guy&hellip;He&rsquo;s stronger than you, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, I managed to say an honest thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s expression was bitter, as if he didn&rsquo;t want to admit it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible, there is a small chance&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looked quite chagrined.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru also continued whispering, &ldquo;But the probability is not zero&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just admit it. It was time to be honest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu&hellip;I have fought that Zegion as well. In addition to his terrific fighting sense, he has an advantage over demons and can nullify even half-baked magic. He is a disciple of Veldora-sama, and even I was almost defeated by him. Well, it&rsquo;s not a defeat if I don&rsquo;t admit it as a defeat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Losing doesn&rsquo;t count unless I say so!&rsquo; Diablo said such a thing with a smile, but it was no laughing matter for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As was the case with Razul, insectoid superiors were natural enemies of the demons. Zegion, too, seems to have been one of those beings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, it seems that Testarossa had also challenged Zegion, but she had never been able to beat him. Diablo had been very happy to see such a frustrated Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, those three demon girls were extraordinary just by being able to fight against Zegion on equal terms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was my honest impression after seeing the fight just now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now then, it was time to review the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle in the labyrinth ended, more or less, as expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The plan of drawing them in was a great success, and Kumara&rsquo;s victory was also applauded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalmann&rsquo;s group and Apito&rsquo;s side had regrets, but that was due to a bad match-up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That said, there was someone who had rounded up all those strongmen together and even gave them time to recover.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was all the work of Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion had brought in all those he recognized as strong through his &lsquo;Spatial Manipulation&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most frightening thing about Zegion&rsquo;s work was his sense of perception. He must have been meditating and observing all of the battles in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He did not intervene until the battles were over, and then had gathered only the most powerful survivors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was really doing something terrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he lost the battle, the other Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten would not have been silent about his foolishness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, no one complained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps it was because the losers had no right to complain, but more than that, it was because everyone recognized the Zegion&rsquo;s strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem to just leave it to Zegion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora was also reported to have given his approval.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From my point of view and Benimaru&rsquo;s, I would have like to see a surefire victory. If he tried to heal the enemy and lost the battle&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if was worried about such a situation, there had only been four enemies left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed to me that complaining about such a small thing would not be the proper behavior of a demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided to be magnanimous and allow Zegion&rsquo;s selfishness to prevail.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, I was able to gather combat information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought it would be interesting to see Zegion&rsquo;s true ability here, so I decided to let him do as he liked.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The result was an overwhelming rampage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a word, it was one-sided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first to make a move was Bazin, who had fought alone against the death dragon. From the very first blow, Bazin struck Zegion with his full strength with a sword that seemed to shatter the earth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion received the blow with his left hand so as not to impede his opponent&rsquo;s movement. Bazin lost his balance and was unable to deliver a series of blows as the sword was gently pushed down the side of his body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion did not miss the opportunity and succeeded in getting close in. He stepped forward with his right foot with force, and at the same time, he drove his right fist into the opponent&rsquo;s armor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wondered how much power was put into that fist. The hardness of his fist was equivalent to legendary-grade armor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bazin&rsquo;s shining armor was shattered, and his life was taken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was less than three seconds after the battle began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their comrade had died so suddenly that they could not think straight. The female wizard named Reicha stood frozen. It is obvious what would happen to her if she acted like that in front of Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was lucky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was able to die without pain and without fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reicha was cut in two by hand and fell down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing this, Krishna, who had defeated Albert, screamed out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! How dare you kill Reicha! Go to hell! Die, you monster!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Krishna&rsquo;s rage increased his fighting spirit, unleashing his divine speed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Dimensional Slash was a slash that pierced through all defenses and severed all dimensions. Without Spatial Manipulation skills such as my &lsquo;Spatial Domination&rsquo;, it was impossible to fight against. It was not an exaggeration to say that it was a special kill shot, a blow comparable to that of a holy sword technique.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Zegion would not be defeated by it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Zegion said this, a distortion appeared around him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wait, isn&rsquo;t that a Distortion Field, the kind of &lsquo;Absolute Defense&rsquo; from the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo;?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion had mastered the &lsquo;Absolute Defense&rsquo; perfectly, even though it had a reputation of being broken when I used it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion spoke to the astonished Krishna.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Before this technique given to me by Rimuru-sama, any attack amounts to nothing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t remember teaching him this.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;&hellip;&hellip;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wisdom King Raphael-san, so you did this&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mean, Zegion&rsquo;s Spatial Domination ability was beyond the power of a Unique Skill. It was as good as what I used. That was why he could fight with Veldora in combat alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No wonder Krishna&rsquo;s attack was blocked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that Krishna&rsquo;s team would never win the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen up, Krishna!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That suavely dressed guy&mdash;Minits, I think his name was. Minits called out to Krishna.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This guy is crazy. While I&rsquo;m slowing him down, finish him off with everything you&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apparently, he had not given up the victory just yet. I praised him for that achievement, even if he was an enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits covered Zegion with his own power. This power had already been revealed. Apito&rsquo;s defeat had not been in vain. Manipulation of gravity with the Unique Skill &lsquo;Oppressor&rsquo;. Minits intended to use this power to concentrate the surrounding gravitational force on Zegion and constrain his movement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But alas&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It did not work on Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By distorting the space around him, he was also able to manipulate the flow of gravity as well. I was so surprised to know that he could use it in such a way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That said, why is Zegion so strong???</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doubts in my mind began to swell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the first place, how was Wisdom King Raphael-san able to instruct Zegion?</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;You may have forgotten, but the Master has given his flesh to Zegion. A &ldquo;Soul Corridor&rdquo; was connected to the Master&rsquo;s body.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I remember. When I saved Zegion from dying, I did indeed close his wound with a piece of my own body. But then, Apito had the same condition, didn&rsquo;t she?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. It is due to the difference in talent. Individual Zegion&rsquo;s physical performance (specs) are extraordinary and he has been imposed the maximum degree of hyper-optimization. As a result, Zegion has acquired abilities similar to those of the Master.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though Apito was amazing enough, it seems that she was not enough for Wisdom King Raphael-san. It seemed to be satisfied with Zegion, so I guess I didn&rsquo;t really have a concrete idea of how great he was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mean, just what the hell is &ldquo;hyper-optimization&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s just magical modification, isn&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had never heard of that before&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is to say, Zegion was the pure crystallization of Wisdom King Raphael-san&rsquo;s hobby. If I looked at it that way, it was no wonder he was so crazy. Wisdom King Raphael-san has a reputation of always going too far. It had done it again behind my back, huh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion, the ideal fighting-type majin, had blossomed after his training with Veldora. There was no way that anyone else could have matched him. And as expected&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dimensional Ray!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zegion opened the five fingers of his right hand and swung them down carelessly. Just by doing so, a dimensional disconnection, in other words, a spatial disconnection, occurred. This was also a phenomenon that could not be resisted without a Spatial Manipulation Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two Imperialists reacted quickly, but it was meaningless just to receive the attack. Krishna&rsquo;s attempt to counteract the attack with a dimensional cut was sliced in half. The difference in power was obvious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits was trying to deflect the spatial rupture by surrounding himself with interference waves, but&hellip;This was also a futile attempt. Almost all physical phenomena could not counter a spatial distortion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The look of surprise on his face was beyond description. It was the look of a man who had never been defeated by anyone before, and had now been defeated for the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minits probably left to the other side before ever even admitting his defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, less than a minute after the battle began, the challengers were all dead. As one could see, Zegion was very strong. I was surprised by Kumara&rsquo;s extraordinary strength, but Zegion&rsquo;s strength was far beyond that. In some cases, he might even be better than me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No way. That&rsquo;s impossible. He was already beyond limits of biology. He was definitely a transcendent being, stronger than a serious Hinata. According to my calculations, Apito was as strong as Karion or Frey. But even Apito would not be able to stand even three minutes against Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Zegion got serious, the battle would be over in an instant. No, that would no longer be a battle. That would just be a one-sided massacre.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How is such a strong person just nesting in the labyrinth? Isn&rsquo;t it a waste?&mdash;I thought about this, but he really was a secret weapon. I shouldn&rsquo;t let this guy be released to the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, I let it be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I knew there were strongmen lurking in this world, and I wasn&rsquo;t going to let my guard down, but&hellip; I never thought that such an extraordinary person would be hiding out in our country. I thought he had looked strong, but he was far beyond my imagination. Indeed, this world was an incomprehensible place. Or rather, more importantly than that&hellip;there was something else to reflect on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I kept entrusting Wisdom King Raphael-san with things, things could really get terribly out of hand. I couldn&rsquo;t afford to be lazy now, either. We would have to have a long talk later to see if it had done anything else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that in mind, I was relieved that the battle in the labyrinth had ended without incident.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

It was a virtual massacre, but for me it meant that I had gained the souls of more than 500,000 people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This made up more than 770,000 souls in total. I was now able to evolve seven of our own leaders. When the remaining ground battles were over, I would consider who to evolve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for the ground battle, we still had to be on our guard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The remaining imperial army is less than 200,000. It&rsquo;s a large army, but it seems small compared to the beginning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s been two days since the last mission to the labyrinth, but there has been no movement. There is no sign of more troops. Honestly, the enemy commanders must be incompetent if they are still sticking to the labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, Benimaru was right. Now that they were slowly losing their strength, I didn&rsquo;t think they could deploy soldiers to the labyrinth anymore. In that case, we would have to go out there ourselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that Over A rank soldiers were gone, the strength of the enemy army was greatly reduced. They were numerous, but we should be able to take them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought so, but I was still worried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what should we do? Not only the number of soldiers but also their quality is still better than ours, isn&rsquo;t it? If we send Second Corps like this, there will be casualties anyhow, won&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could stay here and wait for them to run out of food. That way, we could aim for an unscathed victory. In our case, we could fight for a year with the food we had stored in the labyrinth. We had a certain number of crops, and when the time came, we could even ask Ramiris to increase the area of our farmland.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we were being careful, we would go with this strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We have already cut off the enemy&rsquo;s supply lines. In effect, we are winning strategically. Now it&rsquo;s just a matter of what to do afterwards&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph! As you said the other day, we are not going to let the invaders return alive, are we? That&rsquo;s right, Benimaru, you can count on us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right in the middle of Benimaru&rsquo;s explanation, Shion interrupted. Benimaru laughed at her comment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that she had been right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let the empire have any more foolish ambitions. For that reason, we must kill all intruders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru also said the same thing as Wisdom King Raphael-san. He was not satisfied with destroying the majority of the imperial army, but rather, as he had originally planned, he remained on the policy of killing all the enemies once and for all. Indeed, he was a man who showed no mercy to his enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t disagree with him on this point. I was ready. Even if I would be resented, only the subjects of the empire would hate us. I just didn&rsquo;t want our bad reputation to spread to the Western Nations&hellip;</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Report. I have a proposal that I would like to try.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh? Wisdom King Raphael-san seems to have a plan. It doesn&rsquo;t always say it like this, so I guess it is not sure about the success rate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is it something we can do right now?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Negative. It would be better to do it after the war is over, because it requires preparation and time.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see. Well, we certainly can&rsquo;t start any strange experiments during the war. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s planning to do, but I&rsquo;m the one who will end up doing it. We would discuss this matter later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I returned my attention to Benimaru. I understood about killing off everyone. The only thing left to do was to make an important request that there would be no casualties on our side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it possible without having anyone killed on our side?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As long as we, the leaders, are in charge.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were confident as ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And to Benimaru&rsquo;s words, not only Diablo and Shion, but even the mild-mannered Geld nodded their heads.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what exactly are you planning to do?&rdquo; I asked, and Benimaru started to explain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We must definitely guard Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone nodded. Everyone seemed to agree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we kill everyone who entered the labyrinth except for Lucius and Raymond? Do we have to be so careful?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those two aforementioned people were still prisoners of war. I didn&rsquo;t take them into custody because they didn&rsquo;t seem like they would betray me. Just in case, they were being kept on the 60th floor, where they were protected by Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was showing them the battles at each floor of the battle because he thought things would be boring for them. Lucius and Raymond&rsquo;s reactions were also recorded, and they were absolutely amazed at the way the labyrinth guardians fought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">&ldquo;Hey, defecting to this side was right, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You should be thankful to us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">&ldquo;You should be grateful to us for at least three meals.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">&ldquo;Well, well, well. We&rsquo;ve been down this road before. I understand how you feel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra and Shinji and the others were very comforting to them. I didn&rsquo;t think we needed to worry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now we had to check if anyone invaded the town before the war started.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Souei, did anyone invade the town?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ve already taken care of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure he had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the fact that Souei answered like this meant that I could rest assured.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;This time, we have succeeded in eliminating every single person who entered the labyrinth. We confirmed that only Krishna used the Resurrection Bracelet, but since he is out of the labyrinth, it is not a problem.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, so Krishna survived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was quite strong, but Wisdom King Raphael-san already knew that information. So it was not a problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, the labyrinth seems to be safe now, so I guess we don&rsquo;t have to worry that much. In the first place, those Kansas, Minits, Imperial Guardians, and others of that class would have been stronger than me before I became a demon lord. Chloe told me that I didn&rsquo;t evolve into a demon lord at that time, so it&rsquo;s no wonder they killed me, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that situation, Diablo wouldn&rsquo;t have been there either. Since Veldora had not been revived yet, Zegion and others must have been in a state before they had evolved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In terms of strength, they would have been much weaker than they are now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the empire had attacked us in such a situation, I would not be surprised if we would have been defeated and that I would have died.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;&hellip;It&rsquo;s not possible.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, no, no, it&rsquo;s possible, isn&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I know Wisdom King Raphael-san hates to lose, but that&rsquo;s just being a sore loser.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mean, it had been &lsquo;Great Sage&rsquo; at that time.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;&hellip;&hellip;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, you beat me to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve won like this.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px;"><img alt="" src="images/image11.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, there was no such thing as winning or losing when it came to an argument like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, Rimuru-sama may be correct&hellip;&rdquo; Benimaru agreed, looking unlikely to accept it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion, however, was adamant in her refusal to admit it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No! There is no such thing as defeat!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, no, it was definitely possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As much as I&rsquo;d like to say that history would prove it, there was a different history now. It was hard to explain it to someone like Shion unless the truth was right in front of her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I gave up on explaining to Shion and decided to go back to the story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to discuss it now. What is important is the fact that there were strongmen in the empire. There may be others left, and we can never be too careful. I&rsquo;m glad you want my protection, but I don&rsquo;t want you to get hurt because of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The labyrinth was probably safe, and I thought it would be better to settle this all at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was my intention, but it seemed that my words had tremendous power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, if Rimuru-sama insists so, I will go out to the battle. I will end this battle in an instant!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Diablo, I won&rsquo;t allow you to run away! I will not give up this opportunity to introduce my secret troops to Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milord, wait a minute! Testa and Ult were given a chance to play a part, but I was left out! Give me the order to go out too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo, Shion, and Carrera, who opened the door and jumped in, began to make a big fuss that they were going to go out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You guys&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was also stunned by this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Geld was laughing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, okay. I&rsquo;ll just stay here and leave the final battle to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, Benimaru agreed to allow Diablo and the team to go out to the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

The main force will be my 30,000 Red Numbers and 17,000 elite soldiers from Geld&rsquo;s Yellow and Orange Numbers. In terms of quality, we&rsquo;ll be on par with the remaining Imperial Guard, and I&rsquo;m connected to the commanders and captains by a &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo;. I am sure that we can make flexible tactical actions, and if the situation is limited, we can have a more than even battle. So, Shion, how many of your secret troops do you have?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The current battle strength was 47,000. On average, they were equivalent to B-plus rank, so it was a sufficient force. But the number of the Imperial Army was almost four times as large&hellip; We might be defeated at this rate, no matter how much of an operational advantage we have&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 10,000 in all. By the way, I have left only those who have endured my training, so you can consider them to be of B-plus rank or higher at least.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion&rsquo;s escort&mdash;commonly known as the Shion fan club.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a mysterious unit, separate from &ldquo;Yomigaeri&rdquo; and lead by Dagruel&rsquo;s sons, but its size had swelled beyond my imagination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are there really that many of them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was surprised that they had grown to such an extent while I was away from them for a while. I knew that Gobzo and others had joined, but there seemed to be all sorts of other colorful members&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes! I have been secretly training them myself to be a suitable part of Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s escort!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip;but that&rsquo;s your escort, not mine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh well&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At times like these, I would just be glad to have more reliable allies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even so, we&rsquo;re outnumbered by far. So, I&rsquo;m counting on the leaders&rsquo; performances. First, confuse them with your big moves, and then hit them hard. Of course, the enemy will not just stand by and watch. Who will be the first to go out, assuming they are interrupted?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Originally, Benimaru was supposed to be in charge of this role.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the time when a wide-area incineration attack&mdash;Hell Flare&mdash;would be the best option. Unfortunately, Benimaru was going to remain here as my escort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So then, who would go?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milord, I&rsquo;m still here, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well&hellip;yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suppose she was very qualified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I glanced at Benimaru, and our eyes met. He gave me a small nod, so I decided to leave it to Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, this is my&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Okay, I&rsquo;ll leave it to Carrera. Use your flashy magic and knock those Imperial Guards off their feet!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me Milord!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, Diablo had been about to say something too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, Diablo. What were you going to say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no. It&rsquo;s nothing. Nothing important. Good for you, Carrera.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m so happy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sparks seemed to be flying between Diablo and Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could it be that Diablo was planning to recommend himself?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If so, I felt bad, but I wondered if Diablo could handle large-scale magic?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It should work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wondered if he was trying to do his best in front of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt a little sorry for him just thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Diablo, but I was actually thinking that I wanted you to take out the enemy commander-in-chief!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I jumped down from my chair and stood in front of Diablo, transforming from slime to human form. I put my hand on his shoulder saying that I had been thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo&rsquo;s cheeks loosened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looked so happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know, perhaps there&rsquo;s a strongman hiding amongst them that we haven&rsquo;t seen yet. That Krishna guy from earlier seems to be back, so it should be easy for you to follow his trail, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This guy was a bit of a stalker, so he should be good at that kind of thing. When I asked him about it, he answered cheerfully saying, &ldquo;Of course, Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded my head, thinking &lsquo;sure enough&rsquo; to myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There may be more powerful and fearsome people hiding in the empire. I think we need to show them our power here in order to find them. Carrera, Diablo, I&rsquo;ll put you up to the task!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I swear I&rsquo;ll do my best, milord!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s order&mdash;my heart is pounding!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thank goodness. Carrera looked happy to have her turn, and Diablo&rsquo;s mood was much better now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This would make things way easier for Geld and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Make sure that Carrera&rsquo;s magic will not be interfered with by the other troops. And if anyone should appear to get in the way, then Shion, your unit will deal with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru took over my words and sent out instructions. I guess I could leave the rest to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As for the formation, Geld will be in the front row, and Shion will playing guerilla tactics as I just said. We can count on the firepower of Red Numbers for the pursuit, but as to who will be in charge of the command&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That person needed to be connected to Benimaru by a &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; and able to reflect his will immediately. Although the &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; allowed orders to reach the end of the line, a wrong action on the battlefield could be fatal. A person who could make detailed corrections was absolutely necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobua should be able to play such a role, but it might be too much for Shion and Geld.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then Gobua&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please wait!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if interrupting Benimaru&rsquo;s words, the door to the Control Room suddenly opened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In came Momiji, the acting leader of the tengu clan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was also Hakurou&rsquo;s daughter, so she was a close friend of ours. But still, it was a problem that she could enter the Control Room so easily in this heavily guarded environment&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, Shuna-sama kindly invited us in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna had been doing all the hard work of bringing in food and preparing tea and such. It seems that Momiji had been helping Shuna with these things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I decided to listen to Momiji&rsquo;s story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I believe that the role of a substitute for Benimaru-sama should be my responsibility as his future wife!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you talking about&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The substitute for Benimaru in this battle couldn&rsquo;t be just anyone. However, Momiji was a good choice. Her strength was impeccable, and she would not be intimidated by Shion or Geld because of her temperament.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I accepted Momiji&rsquo;s offer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Momiji-dono, you can count on me as a sister-in-arms!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion had no complaints. She seemed to be quite comfortable with her since she knew that she was Hakurou&rsquo;s daughter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree with you. The Red Numbers are a meritocratic unit of majin. I think it&rsquo;s better to ask for the tengu&rsquo;s cooperation than use the Kurenai alone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld said this, and no complaints had been heard from the other executives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Since there seems to be no opposition, why don&rsquo;t you leave this to your wife, Benimaru-kun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was Benimaru against it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not certain, but perhaps he didn&rsquo;t want to send his wife to the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, you&rsquo;re worried about your wife.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one thing, but&hellip;huh? No, it&rsquo;s not!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru almost confessed to the truth, but he hurriedly tried to deny it. Then, he was unexpectedly interrupted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Big brother!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The door opened with a loud bang, and Shuna was standing on her haunches, shouting to Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Momiji-sama has been preparing your meals for the past few days! She wants you to eat delicious food, and she asked me to teach her how to cook. You can&rsquo;t disrespect her kind attitude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Momiji nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, I had noticed that too. Compared to Shuna&rsquo;s cooking, there was still differences in some areas. That is why I was willing to accept Momiji&rsquo;s offer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But that has nothing to do with&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Brother!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is Benimaru also weak against his sister?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In the first place, it&rsquo;s Brother&rsquo;s fault for being indecisive. That&rsquo;s why Momiji-sama is worried. If you&rsquo;re a man, you should just make it clear just who you love!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, yes indeed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wondered which one, between Alvis or Momiji, Benimaru would choose. But I didn&rsquo;t think this was the time to talk about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt for Benimaru from the bottom of my heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I, too, would not have wanted to talk about this in front of everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, Shuna-sama. Victory is something we take in our own hands!&rdquo; Momiji declared emphatically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis was at a huge disadvantage. Momiji had done a better job of laying the groundwork.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as was thinking that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t allow you to sneak away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To my surprise, even Alvis appeared. She stepped out from behind Shuna.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have just arrived with reinforcements from Eurazania,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis had brought a letter from Milim, which I had neither asked for nor heard about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Do your best!&rsquo;&mdash;was the only sentence written on the letter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That could be interpreted in various ways, depending on who it was addressed to. Regardless of that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How did Alvis get into the labyrinth?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milim-sama used magic. Rimuru-sama developed it himself, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, sure&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So Milim got permission from Ramiris through &lsquo;telepathy&rsquo; and sent her army directly into the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought it was a crazy move, but Milim could do anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Plus, Alvis was leading an army of 20,000 men. Not only beastmen, but there were also harpies. Some members of Beast Master&rsquo;s Warrior Alliance were also participating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Benimaru put on a bitter face about this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He could not refuse Alvis&rsquo;s reinforcements as long as it was Milim&rsquo;s intention, and Momiji would never back down now that this was the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, okay. Momiji, I entrust you with my army. You can take my place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;With pleasure!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Momiji looked happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And thus, the battle of the women began once more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t drag me down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmmm, just what is that supposed to mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wondered if things could go wrong as I watched the sparks fly off the wall.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Shion was on the right flank and Alvis on the left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt a little better, but the battle was not over yet. I ordered the corps to get ready for battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion and Geld began to move as if they had been waiting for me. Momiji followed them, and the Control Room became a flurry of activity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the ninety-fifth floor, which was now the hundredth floor, there was a large vacant lot. It was not big enough for military training, but there was no problem even if all the members gathered there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the members of Geld&rsquo;s Second Corps and Benimaru&rsquo;s Fourth Corps were waiting in the vicinity of the 100th floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They would gather in an hour or so, so I decided to go out to inspire them. In any case, the corps would have to be transported to the ground by transfer magic, and I was the only one who could handle that kind of magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, may I have a word?&rdquo; Souei asked me as I was getting ready to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I just got a call from Moss. He said he detected signs of battle in the Blumund area. He says that Treyni-dono and someone else are engaged in battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Come to think of it, Treyni-san hadn&rsquo;t been seen for about ten days now. She had left the labyrinth saying that she was going to meet some suspicious guy, but she hadn&rsquo;t come back yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could she have been fighting with them ever since?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Souei, I&rsquo;m sorry, but could you go and help her?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei hesitated for a moment when I asked him. I guess he was worried about my reduced protection, but I honestly thought everyone was worrying too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t expect them to be so nervous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was still with me, and I could call the Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten if the time came. I was more worried about Treyni-san than myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei exchanged glances with Benimaru and nodded his head. He seemed to think that if Benimaru was there, then everything would be all right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt happy, frustrated, and other mixed feelings about the fact that he was so worried about me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, Chloe had said that I was killed. But I&rsquo;m a demon lord now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wisdom King Raphael-san would let me know if anything happened, so there was no use in worrying about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, sir. Then I&rsquo;ll leave immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as I said that, Souei disappeared. As usual, it was a perfect &ldquo;Instantmove&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Treyni-san had been fighting for a long time, the opponent must be a very good fighter. If so, I think she can win if Souei joins her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was a little worried about them, and I was curious to know what kind of opponent they were, but I couldn&rsquo;t make any more moves. First, we had to finish the battle at hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One hour later&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A large number of majin were crowded into a vacant lot on the 100th floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I showed up, they all stood erect and silent. It was a bit scary, but they were so well organized.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Morale was high, and they seemed to be very motivated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh&hellip;everybody! We&rsquo;re going to drive out the Imperial Guard in this one battle. Our goal is complete victory. Make sure that no one is left behind and that everyone comes back alive. That is all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I&rsquo;ve said before, I&rsquo;m really not good at giving speeches. I wish Wisdom King Raphael-san would write the speech so I can read it out loud, but it just pretends not to hear me only at these times. I had to do my best to convey the message in my own words, which, surprisingly, was accepted by the majins. I heard later that it was a big hit not only with the old majins but also with the new majins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Woo, woo, woo, woo! The words of His Majesty Rimuru&mdash;they&rsquo;re the best!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can die happily now. I have no regrets!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You idiot! You&rsquo;ll be killed if you die!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Something like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unaware of this, I sent the silent army back to the ground with a transfer spell.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I didn&rsquo;t see any movement among the Imperial Guard generals, but there were signs of a flurry of activity at the top floor. Krishna and the others must have reported what happened in the labyrinth. Once they realize they&rsquo;re the only survivors, they&rsquo;ll pull out. Well, before that, I&rsquo;m not going to let the situation get to that point.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru answered with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I, too, would be worried about losing contact with my subordinates, so I would take some countermeasures at that point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To tell the truth, I had not expected them to fall for our plan so splendidly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be greedy in anything you do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true. War and looting go hand in hand, but at least in our army, that&rsquo;s forbidden.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Excellent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In war, the side that loses their cool suffers the loss, but when their desires are stimulated, they immediately become passionate. In this case, we took advantage of this habit, and it worked frighteningly well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would take this case as a lesson to us and be careful not to get ourselves into the same situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was about to return to the Control Room when I discussed with Benimaru about something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suddenly thought of a possibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If something happened now, wouldn&rsquo;t we just only have you and me here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, if there are enemies hiding in the labyrinth, I&rsquo;m sure they wouldn&rsquo;t let this opportunity pass by, would they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way. There&rsquo;s no way they couldn&rsquo;t make a move at such a good time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was just being paranoid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Wisdom King Raphael-san assured us that the labyrinth was safe. There was no end to doubts once you get started, so I thought it would be better to stop thinking about this matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason why I kept thinking the same thing over and over again was because I had anxiety in my mind. I&rsquo;ve had a bad feeling about this since a while ago&hellip;</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;&hellip;&hellip;?&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, it&rsquo;s nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not doubting Wisdom King Raphael-san, but I&rsquo;ve been wondering if I&rsquo;m missing something.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. All suspicious persons have been confirmed.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I trust that they have.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But on the other hand. What if it&rsquo;s someone we know well?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elen and the others, for example. We trust them, so if they betrayed us, they could do a lot of damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, that was just a metaphor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no reason for Elen and the others to betray me, and we had built up trust in each other. I can assure that they would be fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I wondered if it was really true for all the others&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;&hellip;&hellip;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our country&rsquo;s executives were fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles-kun and others were working hard and sleeping hard. I couldn&rsquo;t doubt him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other people I had gotten to know well were those who came to stay in my country after the Founding Festival.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, for example&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mr. Rimuru&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I saw people coming from Labyrinth City.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No way. It couldn&rsquo;t be them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Waving his hand at the front was Masayuki-kun, whom I knew very well. There were two other followers of Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A warrior and a magician, their names were Jinrai and Bernie, I believe. I hadn&rsquo;t talked with them much because they were still hostile to me until now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this, but is there a possibility that Masayuki is after me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, that&rsquo;s too much to think about.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;True.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru dismissed my concerns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t want to doubt Masayuki either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, Gadra had said that Masayuki looked just like Emperor Rudra or something like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, no, no, no&hellip;it&rsquo;s just that he happened to look similar.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Answer. After considering the history of the empire and many other factors, there is a 0 percent chance that Masayuki is the same person as Emperor Rudra.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At ease for the time being, I replied to Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, Masayuki, is something wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You ask me! You appointed me as the leader of the corps without my permission, so I&rsquo;m in a lot of trouble! Even the vampire members are asking me to join temporarily, and it&rsquo;s really hard for me. Then, there was a flurry of activity earlier, wasn&rsquo;t there? That&rsquo;s when everyone started to make a fuss about what&rsquo;s going on&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki said that the number of applicants was increasing rapidly, and just organizing them was a challenge. The army had just gone into action under such circumstances, he said, and the bloodthirsty people were now making a fuss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His face was so gaunt that he did not look like he was acting. If Masayuki were suspicious, Wisdom King Raphael-san would have warned us earlier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, Masayuki was excluded from the list.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Most of them are staying in their original towns, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, they are, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The town used to be on the ground, but it was now evacuated to the 101st floor below the ground. The sun&rsquo;s rays and the stars were still visible, so one may be surprised if people were upset about situation. The war had already started, but some people seemed to think that the standoff was still going on in some distant place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The 20,000 strong Volunteer Corps were in charge of maintaining the security of the town, but such a situation had not caused any confusion. Masayuki himself, however, seemed to have been quite busy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem was the researchers living in &ldquo;Labyrinth City&rdquo;. They were supposed to be clerical workers, but most of them, who were sent by Luminas, were Calamity-class researchers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were called &ldquo;Surmounters,&rdquo; and they had a lot of free time on their hands. To them, this war was also like a celebration, and they even went to negotiate with Masayuki, saying that their willingness to participate was high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bacchus, who was dispatched by the Holy Knight Order, and Jiwu, a girl who was a friend of Masayuki&rsquo;s group, were in the process of appeasing them. They said that they wanted something to help because they could not get things under control at this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s possible that they were stirring up Masayuki to cause a commotion. There was a possibility that they would have targeted me, but I think they would have taken action much earlier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, it seemed unlikely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I gave a sigh, thinking that I was overthinking things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right? Please do something!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. The war will be over soon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, no, it&rsquo;s not that easy to just let it be someone else&rsquo;s problem&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki complained to me with a pitiful look on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, don&rsquo;t underestimate my ability to get through to him. I didn&rsquo;t have time to get myself involved in such troubles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was tired of doubting others and I wanted to go back to the Control Room as soon as possible. Then, I&rsquo;d have Shuna make me a cup of tea and eat a nice cake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I bet you&rsquo;re just trying to escape!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a barbaric argument, but this was the secret of laziness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hoped Masayuki would follow my example and reach to this level. That&rsquo;s the reason why I was pushing Masayuki away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all you wanted, I&rsquo;m going back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is the war really going to be over soon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping to end it today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t done anything, and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it, but we&rsquo;ve been fighting for some time&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess that was true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My ideal type of warfare was to keep the public out of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s why, don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo; I smiled and said this to Masayuki to convince him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Problem solved. Hurry back now. Strawberry shortcake&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, hey, wait just a minute. Masayuki-san went out looking for you, so I&rsquo;ve been holding back, but we still haven&rsquo;t given up on defeating you, have we? Forgetting that and trying to take advantage of us is a bit too much of a joke, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just when I thought I had solved the problem, a new one popped up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jinrai, who I had thought was just a lackey for Masayuki, voiced his dissatisfaction here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that; I think there&rsquo;s a misunderstanding here. I don&rsquo;t want to take advantage of you, so that&rsquo;s not very nice&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I excused myself, but that was a pretty bad thing to say. I was trying to take advantage of him, that&rsquo;s for sure, and this might not work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just when I was in a hurry, I got an unexpected reinforcement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jinrai! You&rsquo;re out of line! Rimuru-san is doing his best for the people of this town right now!&rdquo; Masayuki calmed Jinrai down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thank you. I&rsquo;ll treat you to a cake later!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I gave him a grateful look.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jinrai stopped complaining as soon as Masayuki gave him a warning. Jinrai may have had some complaints, but he seemed to have enough courage to swallow them. I thought he was a surprisingly mature man in spite of his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyway, the case was closed. I thought as such, but that was not the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jinrai is right, Masayuki-kun. Don&rsquo;t hold back forever, let&rsquo;s get this guy out of the way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie, who always stood back and watched from the sidelines, turned hot-blooded only at a time like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt sorry for him and wondered how to calm him down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Masayuki-kun won&rsquo;t do it, I&rsquo;ll defeat him for you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie said this and began chanting a spell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought, &ldquo;Oh, come on,&rdquo; but the next moment, he turned serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Holy Purification Barrier!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rsquo; I almost shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This magic was difficult to handle, and only a few people could handle it alone. Bernie was an otherworlder, and I had heard that he was good at magic, but I had not expected him to be able to handle such a high level of holy magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mean, this was really&hellip;</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Notice. Confirmed intent to kill. Individual &ldquo;Bernie&rdquo; is the enemy!&raquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, it finally dawned on me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had been trying to convince myself that I was worrying too much, wondering how it could be possible. But it turned out this was exactly what Bernie right in front of me was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And someone else moved even faster than I did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A clear, high-pitched sound. It was caused by the clash of Benimaru&rsquo;s sword and Bernie&rsquo;s sword of light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bernie, you&hellip;you can handle a sword too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jinrai was surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This must have been the first time that Bernie had used a sword. That meant that Bernie had been deceiving Masayuki and the others all this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, I would never be so foolish as to reveal my hand so easily.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His expression told us eloquently that if he was going to do so, he would aim for a sure-fire kill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it! You&rsquo;ve been lying not only me but also to Masayuki-san!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a very nice thing to say. I was just using him to get close to the demon lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;U-Using him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Masayuki-kun worked well for us. And thanks to him, we have the best opportunity ever. I&rsquo;m grateful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though he was crossing swords with Benimaru, Bernie was talking with Jinrai in a relaxed manner. It was not for me to say, but he seemed to have a great deal of ability hidden in him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru, I&rsquo;m going to join in now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll take care of him. Rimuru-sama, please be on the lookout.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was about to join him, but Benimaru stopped me. I decided to trust Benimaru and strengthened my vigilance. Even under such circumstances, the conversation between Bernie and Jinrai continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me! Masayuki-san worked for your convenience?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah.&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re already aware of it. He&rsquo;s really not much of a man and lives only by bluffing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki&rsquo;s face turned pale when he heard this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;How mean&rsquo;&mdash;I thought, but I guess it was a matter of life and death for Masayuki. However, Jinrai&rsquo;s next remark was something we did not expect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What about it? Masayuki-san is a great guy, bluff or no bluff! He&rsquo;s never once failed us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He really noticed it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had seen through Masayuki&rsquo;s true essence that he wasn&rsquo;t merely a bluffing kid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I began looking at Jinrai in a new light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki also looked at Jinrai with incredulity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Bernie did not like Jinrai&rsquo;s reaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn, so you were aware of it, but you stuck with him anyway. And you respect such an incompetent person? Don&rsquo;t make me laugh.&rdquo; He spat this out in frustration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I was the one who was annoyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with bluffing? I&rsquo;m always bluffing for a living!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ri-Rimuru-san&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true! I used to be nothing more than a businessman. I didn&rsquo;t live in a world of demon lords and heroes. But even so, I&rsquo;m doing my best because I have to. I don&rsquo;t want to be laughed at by people who don&rsquo;t know anything!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki nodded silently at my words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-You&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Jinrai looked at me puzzled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I continued without giving a second thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that obvious? One must always convince themselves that they are doing the right thing, or else there is no way to be the king!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Using the momentum of my shout, I walked up next to Masayuki. Slowly, so as not to provoke Bernie, who was crossing swords with Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everybody is just trying to survive, you know. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m trying to make a world where everyone can live happily together. Masayuki is helping me. He&rsquo;s a big help! I won&rsquo;t allow you to make fun of Masayuki like an idiot!&rdquo; I said to Bernie as I stood in front of Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jinrai nodded his head deeply at my words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Masayuki, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bernie, did you intend to use me from the beginning?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He asked Bernie openly, as if his panicked look just now had been a hallucination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said.&rdquo; Bernie replied carelessly, while keeping his distance from Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was also standing in front of me, staring at Bernie. Under the influence of the Holy Purification Barrier, Benimaru was not able to exert his full strength. Perhaps that was why he seemed to watching the situation instead of attacking all at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Was it Yuuki-san&rsquo;s order?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Oh, I see. Fufu, I&rsquo;d be happy to tell you, but I don&rsquo;t see the benefit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, Bernie made a mocking remark, but he seemed to intend to continue the conversation, at least for the time being.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was it because the &ldquo;Holy Purification Barrier&rdquo; was stable, and he did not doubt his superiority?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Negative. There must be a purpose&mdash;some information has been confirmed. There is another member of Masayuki&rsquo;s group. We have searched the information and found that this person was not in the labyrinth. No record of absence. This person is&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reports were coming in from Wisdom King Raphael-san at a frightening rate. From the fact that the information had not been sorted out yet, Wisdom King Raphael-san must have judged that the situation was very urgent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Among Masayuki&rsquo;s friends, there was another girl named Jiwu, I believe. She and Bacchus were said to be appeasing the Surmounters&hellip;</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Confirmed. A mass murder has occurred in the laboratory on the 100th floor. Individual Bacchus and several Surmounters have been slaughtered. As an emergency measure, the souls have been protected&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s a big deal!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aside from Bacchus, each of the &ldquo;Surmounters&rdquo; were a monster of Special A rank. It was a little unbelievable that they all were killed in such a short time after they left Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was very difficult to defeat a defensive &ldquo;Surmounter&rdquo;. After all, they had &lsquo;Ultraspeed Regeneration&rsquo; and many other special abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps if it was Benimaru with his huge firepower, or Zegion with his extraordinary evolution&hellip; But the other &ldquo;Elite Ten&rdquo; including Kumara would not be able to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there was one more important point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jiwu&rsquo;s lack of a response was information that could not be ignored. Because Wisdom King Raphael-san knew about everything in the labyrinth. And yet, if it could not find her, it meant that Jiwu&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Rimuru-sensei!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A voice echoed faster than &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; entered directly into my mind. At that moment, my time was prolonged by &lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was it me or Wisdom King Raphael-san who reacted?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Either way, it saved our lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Die!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A flash of darkness hit me, right in the chest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone&mdash;perhaps Jiwu&mdash;had taken a shot at me in perfect concealment. But I had succeeded in escaping from her deadly blade because I had dropped all pretense and rolled over on the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was all thanks to that warning voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That voice belonged to a little girl. It was Chloe&mdash;wearing a mask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had reverted to her old way of calling me, but I had no time to point that out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was not good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was on full alert, and Wisdom King Raphael-san was also on alert. There was only one possibility that allowed them to have slipped through my watch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, this assassin had one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I finally confirmed the assassin&rsquo;s appearance, and it was Jiwu. However, her expressionless face was still the same, but the atmosphere was different from before. It was no exaggeration to say that she was a different person, cold and sharp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised. You&rsquo;ve been following me without my knowledge.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jiwu didn&rsquo;t seem upset that she had failed to assassinate me. She pointed the black blade extending from the pendant in her hand at Chloe and spoke to her without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural that you would notice my presence if you were fighting so brazenly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty good, little one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you to tell me that, and I&rsquo;m not little!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the moment she said this, Chloe&rsquo;s figure changed to that of an adult. Then, she pulled out her Moonlight saber.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its mythical-grade brilliance was directed at Jiwu, and then it suddenly stopped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The masked Hero Chloe had arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn, I never thought I&rsquo;d make such a big mistake in this perfectly arranged opportunity. This was a blunder, Jiwu!&rdquo; Bernie clicked his tongue, and then spoke in a displeased tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I was trying to stay out of the way, but I didn&rsquo;t know there was such a hidden person.&rdquo; Jiwu replied, not the least bit offended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These two were acquaintances. It seemed that they were also highly skilled assassins sent by someone who wanted to kill me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their positions appeared to be evenly matched. In other words, there was a strong possibility that Bernie was also an Ultimate Skill holder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie was staring at Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jiwu was holding a sword against Chloe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stood in front of Masayuki and Jinrai to protect them and watched what was happening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s come to this,&rdquo; said Chloe. &ldquo;Now that the whole operation to not expose me has failed, there&rsquo;s no point in hiding what I can do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree. The enemy must be destroyed immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie and Jiwu then put power into the pendants that were the source of their weapons. In response, the pendants glowed strongly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That light was familiar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re Imperial Guardians too?&rdquo; I muttered something like that, and Bernie, who had finished arming himself, nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, the war with the home country has already started, huh? But please don&rsquo;t think of us as any other Imperial Knight.&rdquo; As he said himself, he seemed to be hiding an extraordinary ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Enough chitchat. I&rsquo;ll kill you quickly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jiwu also wore a unique suit of armor. Although similar in design, it was jet-black in color and had a sheen like stars floating in the darkness.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px;"><img alt="IMPOSTORS AMOGUS" src="images/image16.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They might be legendary-grade, but the performance seemed to be as close to mythical-grade as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same was true for Bernie. The color of his armor was gold, but the performance seemed to be equal to those of Jiwu&rsquo;s. It was safe to assume that the wearer&rsquo;s ability was also reflected in the armor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jiwu&hellip;you think that way of me too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki asked sadly, and Jiwu looked at him with cold eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. I was just protecting you because that was my mission.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A simple statement. There was no further meaning in it. I could see how much Masayuki was hurt by it. I wanted to comfort him, but I could not do so now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru, be careful! He is strong. He has an Ultimate Skill for sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ultimate Skill? Is that the ultimate beyond a Unique Skill? Can it be managed with hard work and perseverance?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Impossible. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t think you can win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good grief, to be told that with such certainty by Rimuru-sama, I&rsquo;m more depressed than I thought.&rdquo; Benimaru only laughed at me when I told him so calmly. His expression seemed to be relaxed, so perhaps he had a plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An Ultimate Skill was the only way to defeat another Ultimate Skill. I didn&rsquo;t think that we could overturn this absolute law, but we were also in the labyrinth. I decided to leave things to Benimaru, since he would not die even in case of death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same went for Chloe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe was the strongest hero in the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even without her Ultimate Skill, she had overwhelmed even Veldora. Well, it was not Chloe, but Chronoa who was out of control, but still, her fighting ability was tremendous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now that she had the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth&rsquo;, I didn&rsquo;t think she could be defeated by Jiwu. If there was any concern, it was whether she could control the power of &lsquo;Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth&rsquo; or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, I ordered Wisdom King Raphael-san to make sure.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Understood. Beginning analysis of the enemy&rsquo;s Skill.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Do you think that will work?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, I decided to watch the battle going on, ready to help at any time.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

He gripped the pendant and put his strength into it again. The shape of the pendant changed, and it became fixed in the form of a spear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never shown you this before, but I&rsquo;m good at spearplay,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will show you this as a souvenir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie spoke with a superior attitude, and then he dropped to his haunches and braced himself for a tricky moment. Then he cast a spell without chanting, and the spear was covered with magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The magic he invoked was Thunder Rain. It was supposed to be a ranged attack, but all of its energy was focused on the spear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was quite impressive, but not as threatening as expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru countered with his own sword, &ldquo;Red Lotus&rdquo;, covered with &lsquo;black flame&rsquo;. The crimson blade of the sword was covered with black flames, giving off a mysterious glimmer. It was also splendid. It was as if his commanding ability was just a bonus, and his spirit was as strong as that of a demon god.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They both moved at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had thought Bernie was only a magician, but he was also a great spearman. He was quite strong, as he said so himself. But I was able to follow his movements with ease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only thing that bothered me was that &lsquo;Predict Future Attack&rsquo; did not work. That meant&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Report. Individual Bernie&rsquo;s Skill is preventing any interference.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I knew it. The reason why we had lost sight of Jiwu was probably due to some kind of interference phenomenon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Presumably, Bernie and Jiwu had the power to protect themselves from any interference. This was a great power&hellip; What was more interesting was what other powers they had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru and Bernie are fighting an evenly matched battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s face showed no sign of impatience, and he was able to compete with Bernie. On the other hand, Bernie looked a little irritated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The difference in strength was Benimaru&rsquo;s advantage. Bernie had the advantage in terms of equipment performance. So, it was not so fun for Bernie, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing a good job.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty disappointing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie&rsquo;s face was distorted by Benimaru&rsquo;s reply. Perhaps because his pride was aroused, he stared at Benimaru with eyes as if his parents had been killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How dare you, monster,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In that case, will you be able to say the same thing once you&rsquo;ve eaten this?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie shouted, and tried to get out of Benimaru&rsquo;s strike range with his spear circling. He was probably trying to make a distance between the two in an offensive and defensive move, and to land a killing blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Benimaru did not allow him to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seemed to have completely recognized Bernie&rsquo;s movement, and he closed the distance with ease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was just amazing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I knew that Benimaru had been training in secret, but I never thought that he had grown so much&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In my opinion, Benimaru&rsquo;s skill was better than Hakurou&rsquo;s now. I had thought Albert was a great swordsman too, but Benimaru was definitely better than him. His control of the &lsquo;black flame&rsquo; was also excellent. He did not let his power get the better of him, and treated it as his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Unique Skill &lsquo;Generalissimo&rsquo; seemed to give one the ability to control their own power completely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was honestly impressed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had asked Benimaru if Zegion was stronger than him, but looking at Benimaru now, it was hard to tell who was stronger. Depending on the situation, the goddess of victory might smile upon either of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Amazing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you now, it&rsquo;s just suicide to fight against such strong people. And Rimuru-san is even stronger, you know? So, please refrain from doing anything reckless from now on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, I understand, Masayuki-san.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Behind me, Jinrai and Masayuki were having such a conversation. They probably could not see Benimaru and Bernie. They would only see flashes of light. Well, I guess they could still see how great I was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for me, I had been using Covenant King Uriel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Absolute Defense&rsquo;. However, this was a very hard job. Bernie&rsquo;s attacks were affected by his Ultimate Skill, and if I was not careful, he would be able to penetrate the &lsquo;Absolute Defense&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mean, it was not me but Wisdom King Raphael-san who was having a hard time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two behind me were not important, but the battle between Benimaru and the others was more important now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed like Bernie&rsquo;s secret move was one that couldn&rsquo;t be activated unless we kept our distance from him. He had been trying his best to push Benimaru away from him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru remained cool and calm. He was calmly hunting down Bernie, and was beginning to wound him little by little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like Benimaru&rsquo;s victory was only a matter of time, but apparently that thought was naive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie&rsquo;s position was broken by the onslaught of Benimaru. Taking advantage of this moment, Benimaru slashed him with a sword covered with &lsquo;black flame&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was supposed to be a fatal blow, but Bernie only smirked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As I thought, you can&rsquo;t beat me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His expression was bright, as if he had been trapped in a corner for a long time only to have seen this coming&mdash;no, this situation was &nbsp;all in the palm of Bernie&rsquo;s hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was obvious what had happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An Ultimate Skill could only be countered by another Ultimate Skill&mdash;before this absolute law, Benimaru&rsquo;s attack was nullified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In contrast to Bernie who was proud of his victory, Benimaru&rsquo;s face was distorted in frustration. He must have thought that even if his Unique Skill did not work, his swordsmanship would work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, reality was cruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s sword did reach Bernie, but it was also blocked by Bernie&rsquo;s armor and did not result in a fatal wound. Moreover, Bernie immediately healed his wound by using restoration magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this situation, the only way for Benimaru to win the game was to make a killing blow. Although Benimaru was a better swordsman than Bernie, Bernie was a fighter with an Ultimate Skill. It was an extremely difficult task against a superior player.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was in a difficult situation. From this point, the tide of the battle turned to Bernie, and Benimaru was on the defensive.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Chloe was also having an unexpectedly difficult time. She was far superior to Benimaru in a simple comparison of their abilities. However, Jiwu&rsquo;s forte was attacking at key points and breakthroughs, and she did not intend to engage Chloe in a head-on swordfight. She tried to create a situation in which she could gain an advantage by putting up Isolation barriers to prevent her from calling for support, or by creating a toxic fog that would cause darkness to blind her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such tricks would not work on the masked Chloe. However, even Chloe had difficulty in catching Jiwu, who kept running away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jiwu was running away, and Chloe was chasing after her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The result was the prolongation of the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, unlike Benimaru, Chloe had an Ultimate Skill. Since she had more skills than me, I did not think she would lose to Jiwu by any chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had not paid attention to Chloe because I thought she would be safe, but it seems that things were not so easy as they seemed. At the same time that Benimaru was on the defensive, Chloe was also in trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How can you run away so easily?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I can. Your sword is dangerous. I might penetrate even my own defenses.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jiwu was cautious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was calmly dealing with the unknown opponent Chloe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Absolute Severance&rsquo; was a Unique Skill, but somehow it was as powerful as an Ultimate Skill. Jiwu may have had some modesty in her words, but at least it was true that legendary-grade armor could not protect against Chloe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Absolute Severance&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, even Veldora had been damaged, so one could say that Jiwu&rsquo;s choice was correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t beat me if you keep running away, can you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny your words. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter. My goal is not to win but to cover for Bernie. If Bernie kills that ogre, then we&rsquo;ll both kill you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t keep quiet after hearing such a statement, but that was when Jiwu&rsquo;s sarcasm really kicked in. Every time I tried to join, she launched an attack on Labyrinth City.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Behind Masayuki and the others, there was an isolated town. There was no telling how much damage they would do if they attacked there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jiwu even asked Bernie for assistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bernie, we have an unexpected interloper. This woman is more trouble than she seems. It&rsquo;s dangerous to deal with her and Demon Lord Rimuru at the same time, so we need to play it safe. Help attack Labyrinth City to avoid her intervention.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood. I&rsquo;ll help you as I see fit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the addition of Bernie&rsquo;s attack, my workload doubled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki and Jinrai had the Resurrection Bracelets, so I was prepared for the worst. However, Labyrinth City was home to people who didn&rsquo;t know anything about all this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, this was the safest place and not all of them were wearing the Resurrection Bracelets. Adventurers who were evacuating the city were, but not the ordinary residents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition to preventing stray bullets, we had to deal with the harassment of Jiwu and Bernie. They were emission type attacks, so &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; &nbsp;could do the trick, but I couldn&rsquo;t help Chloe anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be honest, it was a big help that Chloe had noticed and come to help me. If it had been just me and Benimaru, we might have already lost the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, Benimaru could only parry Bernie&rsquo;s attacks. It was also difficult for him to interfere with the attacks on &ldquo;Labyrinth City&rdquo; because he might be defeated by the power of the attack if he was not careful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason why the battle was still going on was that Benimaru&rsquo;s sword skills were higher than those of Bernie&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was coolly defending himself against the onslaught, in which even a single direct hit would kill him. Benimaru should be praised for his ability, though the situation was reversed by the superiority of Skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had thought that these guys were just lackeys of Masayuki&rsquo;s, but they had some great abilities hidden in them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, the fact that they had been deceiving my eyes until now showed me just how good they really were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luminas, too, had missed them at the festival. No wonder I, or rather Wisdom King Raphael-san, didn&rsquo;t notice them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, things were at their worst now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Telepathy Net&rsquo; with Ramiris had been sabotaged, so we would have to get through this difficult situation on our own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps sensing my anxiety, Chloe took a gamble. And it was this that led to an unexpected blunder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that it&rsquo;s come to this, I&rsquo;m going to use my secret technique&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there really was a way out of this situation, I would have liked to ask for it. But for some reason, I had a bad premonition in that moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, the world seemed to go dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All movements stopped, and I felt as if my whole body was in a state of fixation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt as if I had experienced this feeling somewhere else, without understanding what had happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That right, this was the same feeling I had gotten when Guy and Chloe first clashed.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Report. Individual Chloe Aubert&rsquo;s energy has decreased. It seems that she failed to control her Skill.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time, I remembered that it was the same feeling I had when I was stopped in time. Wisdom King Raphael-san had issued a warning to me. Then I noticed that Chloe had turned back into a child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Chloe!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Darn! This power is too inefficient for me to handle right now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I told you! It&rsquo;s hard to control it for a long time.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not clear what had happened, but it was certain that Chloe&rsquo;s stunt had definitely failed. Worst of all, Chloe&rsquo;s ability to fight had also fallen apart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that even Chloe could not completely control the power of the &lsquo;Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth&rsquo;. In the previous fight against Guy, she seemed to have mastered the power of &lsquo;Spacetime King &nbsp;Yog-Sothoth&rsquo;. In reality, however, it was mostly Guy&rsquo;s power, and Chloe had only responded to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, it was impressive enough. If she had not been able to move in that time-stopped world, she would have been defeated unilaterally by Guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there was a large difference between a mock battle and a real battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though Chloe could stop time for a moment, it seemed to consume a lot of energy. The current situation was the proof of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This danger was the reason why it was a problem to use unidentified powers on the spur of the moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be a different story if Chloe could control the power of &lsquo;Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth&rsquo; completely, but even Wisdom King Raphael-san had not finished its analysis yet, so it would be a mistake to expect such a miracle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Hey, Chloe! Are you okay?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;The situation is a little tough. I can get back to my normal state, but it might take a while before I can get back to my normal state&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked her in &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; with concern, to which she replied regretfully. Still, the situation was not the worst. I was relieved that Chloe had not lost her ability to fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you were trying to do, but it was a futile attempt. You can&rsquo;t even grasp your own power. You do things more haphazardly than I thought.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, that&rsquo;s how it is. Jiwu, it just you who is being too cautious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Chloe&rsquo;s failure, Jiwu and Bernie began to laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But at that moment, a voice from heaven echoed in my mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Report. Analysis of enemy-owned skill is completed.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was fast!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth&rsquo; had not been analyzed yet. I didn&rsquo;t think it would be so easy to analyze Bernie&rsquo;s Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was hoping to find out the rough idea of their skills at most, but this was a pleasant miscalculation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what are the contents?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Report. Regarding the skills owned by individual Bernie and individual Jiwu, many common points were confirmed. These are considered to be almost identical. A Unique Skill is one that emerges from individuality, and an Ultimate Skill is the one that goes beyond the limit of Unique Skill. Nevertheless, the similarity of the two skills means that&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Are you saying that Bernie&rsquo;s power is borrowed from someone else?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Affirmative.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, I was thinking that it was a bit unnatural, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To acquire an Ultimate Skill, you can&rsquo;t get one by normal half-hearted efforts. Even Hinata was still at the unique level, and even transcendent people like Granbell and Luminas had not reached the Ultimate Skill level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt bad to say this, but it was not such a simple power that Bernie or Jiwu could easily obtain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Plus, the Ultimate Skill was indicative its owner&rsquo;s unique characteristics. The interference and concealment abilities were excellent, but no other powers were used.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was wary, thinking that there was something hidden, but it seems that this was not the case.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Affirmative. Absolute superiority over magic and Unique Skills, and the complete concealment of his own abilities. These two points are the abilities lent to individual Bernie and the individual Jiwu. Even if the energy of both are backwards calculated, there is no room for them to exercise any more power.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then was it correct to say that this was the only way they&rsquo;re going to use it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One never knew how things would turn out until it was over. I thought so deeply as I saw Bernie and the others laughing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Benimaru! Chloe! I have found out the secret of their power. They are tough opponents, but they are not impossible to beat. I have a proposition for that, will you listen to me?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked the two of them and they nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Of course. If I could cut him with my Red Lotus, we would have won already. What&rsquo;s annoying is that his power is specialized for defense.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru seemed to be determined to continue the fight all the way to the end so that he would not lose. He looked for a chance to win without being deceived by his opponent&rsquo;s words and actions. In the meantime, Diablo and Shion would come back, and he would counterattack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As expected of the &ldquo;Samurai general&rdquo;&mdash;a calm and dependable man at any time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I believe in Rimuru-san, too. I want to make up for this failure, and if you have a plan to win, just tell me!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe also believed in me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike Benimaru, she could have won this battle if she had not been in a hurry. If she had used &lsquo;Absolute Severance&rsquo;, she could have penetrated Jiwu&rsquo;s defense, and would not have lost to her in a one-on-one fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this situation was a good lesson for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe&rsquo;s lack of familiarity with the Ultimate Skill was revealed, but that was something she could improve on from now on. I would look forward to the future and concentrate on finishing this battle for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you. Benimaru, I want you to connect with me through a Soul Corridor. If you do so, I can lend you a part of my power.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want. It is better than losing, although asking for Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s help feels unhelpful. I promise you that we will win.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru readily agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a choice that was typical of Benimaru, who valued practical advantage over pride.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, this time the enemy was using borrowed power, so there was no need to be ashamed of it. If we compared their abilities, Benimaru was definitely the better player.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thinking as such, I gave &lsquo;Absolute Severance&rsquo; to Benimaru&rsquo;s Red Lotus. This was as powerful as the one Chloe was using. It was just a reversal of &lsquo;Absolute Defense&rsquo;, so if both of them collided with each other, they would cancel each other out, but against Bernie, it should work well enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was all set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next was Chloe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Chloe, Chronoa, listen to me. If you can buy some time, Benimaru will defeat Bernie. After that, Jiwu will be&mdash;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, the pattern was reversed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that Chloe was back to her adult form, she was far from her full potential. We should play it safe here and aim for a sure victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe could just buy time for Benimaru to win. That&rsquo;s what I thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Wait a minute! I haven&rsquo;t lost. I&rsquo;m sure I can beat her one-on-one.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yes, Rimuru, the &lsquo;Spacetime King&rsquo; got us in trouble earlier, but if we fight seriously, we won&rsquo;t lose.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two of them were highly motivated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was not surprised because I had expected them to say that. So, I decided to make a proposal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Well, then I have one condition.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;What is it?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Use the &lsquo;Spacetime King&rsquo; again and win it outright.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Huh?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;You can stop time for a short time, but that was too short for Jiwu, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe seemed to have mastered the Skill as long as she didn&rsquo;t do anything reckless. I didn&rsquo;t know how long that short time was, but I guess it was not enough time to catch up with Jiwu who had an Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, she must have exceeded the limit, but perhaps the next time it would be fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I&rsquo;ll help you. I&rsquo;ll help you with the calculation, so let&rsquo;s try again.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;m not complaining&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Rimuru&rsquo;s going to free up the computing space, isn&rsquo;t he? If so, I think I can control it.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe and Chronoa agreed to my offer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They looked worried, but the truth was, I felt the same way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, this was a proposal from Wisdom King Raphael-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wondered if it would be okay, but I believed in Wisdom King Raphael-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess it has some kind of intention, but I was going to trust it and take action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Chronoa raised a question to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;But I don&rsquo;t have enough energy. I can enter into a combat form, but I haven&rsquo;t recovered enough energy to stop time. Even if Rimuru&rsquo;s help will increase the energy efficiency, Chloe won&rsquo;t be able to use it well now.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what I was wondering about too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I know you are planning to lend help, but will it be enough?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Affirmative. No problem.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was a confident reply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It must have something in mind, so I&rsquo;d stop asking for details.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;There&rsquo;s no problem. If you need more, I&rsquo;ll provide it.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wisdom King Raphael-san was the one who was preparing it, though. Well, it&rsquo;s not something I would have to explain here, so I just made it sound good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing my reply, Chronoa agreed with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I understand. Then I agree with you. Let&rsquo;s show here what we got.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the plan was set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The counterattack would begin.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

He had been fighting with a &ldquo;still sword&rdquo; style, but as soon as I gave him &lsquo;Absolute Severance&rsquo;, he changed to a &ldquo;dynamic sword&rdquo; style.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;still sword&rdquo; is a sword technique in which the opponent made the first move, and the main focus was on counterattacks. The basic concept of the kata was to unite offense and defense, with emphasis on blocking and no aggressive attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, &ldquo;dynamic sword&rdquo; emphasized offense more than defense. The essence of this style was to overwhelm the opponent by attacking in a single bound, without giving up the initiative.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie was surprised at the change of Benimaru&rsquo;s swordsmanship, and he was on the defensive. His position was reversed, but at that moment, he looked relaxed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the moment of calm disappeared in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie&rsquo;s composure was based on his proven confidence that Benimaru&rsquo;s sword would not work against him. However, that was already a thing of the past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Bernie was late in dealing with Benimaru&rsquo;s fierce attack, and an opening arose.

Therefore, he died without saying his last words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s strength was overwhelming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you had kept that momentum from the beginning, wouldn&rsquo;t you have won the battle by a comfortable margin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, if I had done that, my Red Lotus would have been broken. I thought that armor was dangerous, so I continued to fight in a way that I was not used to so as not to put a burden on my sword.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that was it. He looked so imposing, but it is true that &ldquo;Dynamic Sword&rdquo; style suited Benimaru better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the Benimaru now was stronger than Hakurou for sure. His physical ability was superior to Hakurou&rsquo;s, but now even his skills were the same if not better. Benimaru was very strong once he really got into the game. In less than a minute from the start of the counterattack, he had defeated Bernie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Chloe was no less.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I knew it, I don&rsquo;t have enough energy!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chronoa shouted in anguish as she tried to activate her ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But right after that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Report. No problem.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition to the calm voice, there was another distressed voice saying, &ldquo;Gywaaahhh!&rdquo; at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wonder what happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess it was that person&rsquo;s scream, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even I felt bad after hearing it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s so pathetic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I know it&rsquo;s not my fault, but I was still the cause.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So then, isn&rsquo;t it still my fault?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I vowed to treat him to a pudding next time, to apologize and to put him in a good mood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, the energy problem was solved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next moment, the world stopped&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Jiwu was reduced to dust.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, that&rsquo;s how Bernie and Jiwu were defeated, and then came the report from Wisdom King Raphael-san in an apologetic voice.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Notice. Confirmed that the individual Bernie and the individual Jiwu are still alive. The existence of the Resurrection Bracelet was forgotten.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Uh&hellip;excuse me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was rare that Wisdom King Raphael-san made a mistake. Well, when I think about it, it&rsquo;s not too much to say that it was the first time, but it was still quite a rare occurrence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh no, we should have broken Bernie&rsquo;s Resurrection Bracelet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, they weren&rsquo;t wearing a bracelet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I was looking too, but I didn&rsquo;t see anything like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oops, unlike me, Benimaru and Chloe were very careful. They remembered the existence of the bracelet and had fought while checking for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or maybe it was me who was too careless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t think Wisdom King Raphael-san overlooked it, so I guess Bernie and the others were just better than us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, about that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki, who had been observing the event for a long time, interrupted our conversation. Jinrai took over Masayuki&rsquo;s comment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, we didn&rsquo;t accept your bracelet because we thought you were our enemy. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we wouldn&rsquo;t use it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saying that, Jinrai turned up the hem of his pants to show us. There, to our surprise, was a bracelet around his ankle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is a bracelet&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I know it&rsquo;s a bracelet. But it&rsquo;s a magic item, right? That&rsquo;s why it works as well as if I wear it here. Bernie said we should do this as a form of defiance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apparently, Bernie had anticipated this situation and had even taken steps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was scratching his head and clicking his tongue, and Chloe was looking unhappy. They must have been boiling under those expressions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t think Wisdom King Raphael-san could have done anything else if this was the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because the place was in isolated state from Jiwu&rsquo;s power, and the communication with Ramiris was blocked because of it. I thought it would have been difficult to explain the exact situation to Veldora, though they could have &lsquo;telepathically&rsquo; communicated with each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, considering the amount of work Wisdom King Raphael-san had to do, it was mind-boggling how much it would have had to do at the same time in parallel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to give &lsquo;Absolute Severance&rsquo; to Benimaru, I had been working with Chloe (Chronoa) on the &lsquo;Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth&rsquo;. A simultaneous control challenge. On top than that, there was maintaining my &lsquo;Absolute Defense&rsquo;, analyzing Bernie&rsquo;s abilities, and the list went on and on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under the circumstances, it was hard to expect that anyone would be stupid enough to put a bracelet on their leg.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess it was inevitable. It can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right. Let&rsquo;s forget about it. We&rsquo;ve seen what they can do, and we&rsquo;ll beat them next time. Although they might send someone else, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll find a way to deal with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru and I decided to forget about this incident.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I thought about that as I watched them slinking back to the hotel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle was still going on. I felt sorry for Masayuki and his friends, but I didn&rsquo;t have time to worry about them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I left Chloe in charge of Masayuki and the others, and Benimaru and I returned to the Control Room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, all the enemies in the labyrinth should have been defeated. Just when we thought that all we had to do was to watch the final battle, we found that there were a few people in the room ahead of us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, Rimuru! You gave us a scare when we suddenly lost contact with you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Well, I wasn&rsquo;t worried about it, but I thought I&rsquo;d still say something to you. Besides, Ramiris insisted. I&rsquo;m not in a hurry&mdash;I just came to see how things were going.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris looked worried and Veldora looked pompous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They complained to me that I should stop taking away their magicules so suddenly, but it was obvious that they were actually really worried about me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I loved this kind of thing, these guys.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So then, Wisdom King Raphael-san, let&rsquo;s at least ask for permission before ever asking for Veldora&rsquo;s power.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;&hellip;? It&rsquo;s too late for that. No problem.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What do you mean it&rsquo;s too late&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could it be that it had been using it as they pleased without telling me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora seemed to have gotten used to it too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If so, I felt bad for Veldora. I would prepare not only tasty snacks but also a new comic book for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I worried you. But Veldora can contact me from anywhere, if you ever need anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? Master?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah! Ahem. I told you there was no need to worry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris looked at him with a cold stare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps embarrassed, Veldora changed the subject in a pompous manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;More importantly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re all right, why don&rsquo;t you hear what they have to say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I followed Veldora&rsquo;s gaze and saw Treyni-san, Souei, and a suspicious man wrapped up in a coil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had noticed the presence of Souei and the others, but who was the other one?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Treyni-san looked exhausted and was drinking fruit juice. She seemed to have enough time to spare, so I left her alone. I looked at Souei and asked him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, I went straight to the place Moss told me about, and this man who was fighting with Treyni-dono was Laplace, our enemy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Laplace who was wrapped up in a coil. He was beaten up pretty severely, but at least he was alive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why is he still alive?&rdquo; Benimaru asked Souei in a cold voice. It was rare, but his murderous intent was obvious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was going to kill him too, but he insisted that he had something he had to tell Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course it must be a trap!&rdquo; Saying this, Benimaru drew his sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, Laplace, who had been lying limp, jumped up like a caterpillar. I thought to myself that he was very dexterous, but at the same time, I was a little amused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; I seemed to have been laughing uncontrollably.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, wait a minute! Don&rsquo;t just laugh at me&mdash;stop your men!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You dare&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei&rsquo;s fury was fierce. Benimaru tried to cut down Laplace without saying a word. I rushed to intervene and calm Benimaru&rsquo;s anger for the time being.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calm down. We&rsquo;re in the middle of a truce with Yuuki, aren&rsquo;t we? Now that we&rsquo;ve brought him here, let&rsquo;s listen to what he has to say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei nodded at my words. Souei was very patient and calm, keeping his moral principles in spite of his temper. Benimaru also admitted his fault and sheathed his sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s the story?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is really a scary place. That sister there didn&rsquo;t listen to me and she was much stronger from when we met before. That big brother was a little better, but he doesn&rsquo;t have a single smile in his eyes. And that one over there&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru-san&hellip;you&rsquo;re revealing your hidden nature&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I coughed and changed the flow of the conversation, which was about to turn serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, Yuuki-san asked me to deliver a message!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace could read the air too. He looked at me appreciatively and started to talk about the reason why he came here. I listened to him, wishing I had done so from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, watch out for Bernie and Jiwu!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru and I looked at each other in silence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wish I had heard about that earlier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace told me that there was a man named Damrada who worked for Yuuki. He was one of the heads of the secret society &ldquo;Cerberus&rdquo; under Yuuki&rsquo;s control, and after receiving advice from Gadra and reviewing the story, Damrada was suspected to have tried to assassinate Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Yuuki did not give such an order. The suspicion was directed towards Damrada. Although it was a suspicion, it was practically a definite one. Yuuki, who had made such a judgment, reviewed his past actions on the assumption that he was correct. He found various suspicious points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He suspected that Masayuki&rsquo;s associates arranged by Damrada might have some sort of secret. In a panic, Laplace, who had been returning from another mission, was assigned to be the messenger&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Laplace&rsquo;s story progressed, Treyni-san&rsquo;s complexion became worse and worse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me earlier?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re going to have to explain that to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I tried to tell you so many times that it was important! But you just said, &lsquo;how can I trust you?&rsquo; And you wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re a suspicious person. Besides, I have a bitter memory of you slipping away before and I was determined not to make such a mistake this time&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re way too determined! I shouted so many times that I was serious this time because it was my job, but you only said, &lsquo;Shut up, no questions asked!&rsquo; You didn&rsquo;t listen to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The answer was obvious when I saw the two of them having such an ugly argument in front of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, have you guys been fighting all this time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I hope you don&rsquo;t mind&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace was sulking. They said they had been fighting for a while now, not just a few days&mdash;maybe ten days?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No wonder he was sulking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so, so sorry!&rdquo; Treyni-san realized her mistake and apologized to me with a red face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But who among us could blame Treyni-san?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We should have more trust in Laplace&mdash;but that was not easy to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because even now he was still suspicious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t think we should judge people by their looks, but in this case, he had been acting suspiciously. The problem was that we needed to trust such a suspicious person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t blame Treyni-san even though she had failed this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru couldn&rsquo;t complain either since he had about to slice him up himself. Souei looked uncomfortable too, and I was rather grateful to him for putting up with me and bringing him all the way here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all over either way. Let&rsquo;s stop worrying about it and let bygones be bygones.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was too late for this, and too much trouble to even think about it. So in that case, let&rsquo;s just cover it up for the time being.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battlefield was more important right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We do not know what would happen until the end. With this in mind, we turned our eyes to the big screen.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

It had already been two days since he had dispatched a hundred of his best men to the labyrinth. He could not hide his dissatisfaction with the fact that he had not heard from them since then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, it wasn&rsquo;t just that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s heart was filled with anxiety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dazzled by money and high quality &ldquo;magic crystals&rdquo;, he had decided to attack the labyrinth. He has no regrets about that. To keep the safety of the army&rsquo;s rear, he could not ignore the demon lord&rsquo;s territory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The treasures obtained were more than expected, and Calgurio was pleased to see them brought out from the labyrinth. Now that he realized this, he was angry at his own inadequacy. At the same time, Calgurio was beginning to fear that he would be defeated by Demon Lord Rimuru with no way to recover from this situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it! Really, is there no report yet?&rdquo; Calgurio shouted for the first time that day. No one in the staff answered him, but at that moment, a murmur could be heard from outside the camp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? What happened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if to answer Calgurio&rsquo;s question, a low-ranking soldier rushed in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sir! A member of the &lsquo;Magic Tank Division&rsquo; has just joined us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;What?&rsquo; Calgurio thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if the performance of the magic tanks were superior, it was impossible that no sound of driving could be heard until they joined the division.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the messenger had never come back, the war situation of their comrades remained unknown. Considering this point, his bad feeling was only getting worse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s fears came true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon saying these words, a beautiful female officer, who did not look like she belonged on the battlefield, entered the field tent where Calgurio was staying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Misha who represented &lsquo;Women&rsquo;, one of the heads of the secret society &ldquo;Cerberus&rdquo;. She had been engaged in the Calgurio interception operation under Yuuki&rsquo;s orders, and she was engaged in this operation as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, her position as a general staff officer of the Imperial Armored Corps was real. She served Calgurio as a staff officer of the Imperial Armored Corps, showing a certain level of competence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Misha was assigned to the &lsquo;Magic Tank Division&rsquo; this time, not to the main unit. Calgurio had assigned Misha to the &lsquo;Magic Tank Division&rsquo; for safety reasons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha, whose objective was to monitor Calgurio&rsquo;s movements, was honestly dissatisfied with this decision. However, she was not in a position to interfere, and she gave Yuuki a status report while pretending to be grateful for Calgurio&rsquo;s goodwill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, she also reported the defeat of the &lsquo;Magic Tank Division&rsquo;. After that, she carefully left the battlefield without being detected by the monsters, and thus joined up with the main group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Misha, you are safe!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Calgurio-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha smiled bewitchingly. Even in her dirty clothes, there was no sign of a shadow on her good looks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio was relieved to see Misha like this, but he had not forgotten his part.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what about the others? How soon can we join with the main group?&rdquo; he asked in rapid succession.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please wait, sir. There is nothing we can do in a hurry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? What does that mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been wiped out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The &lsquo;Magic Tank Division&rsquo;, the pride of the Empire, and a hundred of its tiger airships, have all been reduced to ashes.&rdquo; Misha told Calgurio with a bewitching smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&hellip;What the hell are you talking about?&rdquo; Calgurio laughed in disbelief, but Misha remained silent. Seeing this, Calgurio had no choice but to believe her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure, they&rsquo;re all gone?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re saying that the only survivors of the Armored Corps are the ones here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is correct, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing Misha&rsquo;s reply, Calgurio hung his head. Not just Calgurio, but also the rest of the staff members had a pallid look on their faces. The invasion had been a complete failure. Even if they had succeeded in conquering the labyrinth, there was no way to escape being held accountable for the loss of so many lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emperor Rudra would never forgive them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; Calgurio&rsquo;s mutterings were not answered by his advisors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, Misha spoke up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We should leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have glimpsed that you have not been able to capture the labyrinth. The labyrinth is to be explored, it is not to be invaded by an army.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that what Yuuki said?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. He said that only the best should be sent to conquer the labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nonsense! We were sending our best!&rdquo; Calgurio shouted back at Misha, now furious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio was right. In fact, they had just sent in the best force they could think of two days ago. And he had sent the best of the Augmented Legion, the most powerful of the Imperial Guard, totaling to more than 500,000 men. To ask for more would be asking too much. He was sure that they would meet up with each other in the labyrinth. And even now, they must be marching to conquer the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio believed so. If he did not believe so, his heart would have been filled with fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Calgurio received the unrelenting words of Misha.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But the labyrinth is still alive and well, even though it has swallowed up the best of our army. Indeed, it is possible that the battle is still going on inside. But we can&rsquo;t find out what&rsquo;s going on and it&rsquo;s hard to send any more reinforcements, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All we can do is wait for our comrades to get out alive, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I said shut up! Don&rsquo;t worry, Misha. We&rsquo;re giving necklaces with reviving properties to the top ranks. If you wear the necklace, you will be resurrected outside the labyrinth even if you die. The fact that no one has come out of the labyrinth proves that we&rsquo;re on the right track!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio understood that this was optimistic thinking. But as the general in charge of the whole army, he had no choice but to say so on this occasion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Misha&rsquo;s pursuit was not over. Unlike the other general staff members, Misha had made Calgurio her captive. Misha was confident that he could do whatever she wanted him to do, even if she defied him here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But the revival effect of the necklace that was tried has not been confirmed yet, has it? Yuuki-sama says that if the bracelet is embodied by aa Skill, it is impossible to restore (copy) it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio could not help but be silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no way he could tell his subordinate that he was going to experiment on them and that they had to die to show it. Misha was right. He had sent his comrades in arms away before conducting the experiment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The necklace was just an insurance policy in case of an emergency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio understood this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha was right and he was wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A corps leader was not a position based on strength alone. It was a position that could not be filled without strength, but it could neither be filled by an incompetent person who did not understand the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Calgurio could not find it in himself to believe that there was a structure that remained unconquerable after more than 500,000 elite soldiers had invaded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were an unbelievable military force that could burn several large cities to ashes. Even in the worst-case scenario, he had thought they could escape by destroying the labyrinth&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that wasn&rsquo;t all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, a large number of people had to have died. And if Calgurio abandoned his compatriots inside the labyrinth, his name would remain forever as the incompetent one who had caused this historic defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His own army of nine hundred and forty thousand men now had less than two hundred thousand remaining. There was no way he could retreat from the situation as it was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio now realized that he had underestimated the demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He saw only the Storm Dragon as a threat, with the Demon Lord Rimuru and his army simply as an enemy to be overrun. He did not recognize the enemy as one of whom they should have fought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was a fatal mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it was still too early to give up. There was still hope for Calgurio in the form of Minits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calm down. Major General Minits, the man I trust the most, has entered the labyrinth. I&rsquo;m sure he will bring back some information. We will wait and see what happens&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Calgurio could not finish his sentence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, we should leave now, Calgurio-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A man suddenly entered the tent and advised him to do so without asking permission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who the hell are you?&rdquo; a staff general asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio looked at the man, wondering what the guards were doing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man looked healthy, but the blood on his uniform was disturbing. Since none of the men here were supposed to have been in the battle, it could be a survivor of a detachment, or it could be a man who had been killed in the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My name is Krishna. I am one of the hundred who entered the labyrinth two days ago, and I am ranked 17th in the Imperial Guardians&rsquo; hierarchy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing these words, everyone present was astonished. And so was Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-Imperial Guardians?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why are the Imperial Guardians here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The staff members were agitated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, as it was, Calgurio was the first to regain his composure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now is not the time! Krishna-dono, you say? Can you tell us what&rsquo;s going on first?&rdquo; He gave a quick yell to calm the situation down. Krishna thanked him with a glance, and then hurriedly explained the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I shall tell you plainly. That labyrinth is dangerous. Bazin (Number 35) and Reicha (Number 94) are dead. Even Major General Minits was killed before my eyes. I&rsquo;m not completely sure, but I believe that Colonel Kansas is dead as well. There are no survivors in the labyrinth. You can be sure of that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone who listened to his words was stunned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio wanted to shout out that this was a lie, but Krishna&rsquo;s eyes were serious. His whole body was telling him that what he was saying was true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To begin with, his face was familiar. Calgurio remembered that Krishna was indeed one of the people he had sent out two days before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So he had come back to life. He had the Resurrection Bracelet. Not a replica, but the real one. If so, we can be sure that he is the real one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio, in spite of his desire lash out, tried to think calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were two &ldquo;Resurrection Bracelets&rdquo; submitted by Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One was being analyzed by the technology department for the production of a replica. The other was presented to the emperor. Probably because of the loan of this &ldquo;bracelet&rdquo;, Krishna had been able to revive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This confirmed the revival effect of the Resurrection Bracelet, but it also confirmed that the duplicates were ineffective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This meant that the generals in the labyrinth had been truly annihilated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio paled as he realized that more than 500,000 soldiers had all died.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now was not the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Krishna&rsquo;s explanation was not finished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And the guy who killed us wasn&rsquo;t even the demon lord or one of his Four Heavenly Kings. It was a majin whose name I&rsquo;ve never heard. He was a member of the Elite Ten or something like that, but he was something else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To begin with, the &ldquo;Elite Ten&rdquo; were capable of fighting as well as or better than the archdemons. Among such monsters, a majin who called himself Zegion boasted a strength from another dimension. He was so strong that he made Krishna realize that he could never win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Once again, let us retreat. This is no shame. Make the decision now to save the surviving generals!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Krishna&rsquo;s passion made the soldiers cringe. His words were undoubtedly true. Everyone understood that there was no time to lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;You said it was not the demon lord? That place was crawling with archdemon level monsters? Is it really that big? How can a demon lord who we thought was a newcomer have such a great power&mdash;?!&rdquo; Calgurio exclaimed, as if he couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the signal for the staff members to start making a commotion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s retreat now! This is not our fault alone. The negligence of the intelligence services are also to blame!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We must let those who are still alive escape before Demon Lord Rimuru makes his move!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers were talking and expressing their own opinions. They usually quarreled with each other, but on this occasion, they were all in agreement. They instinctively realized that they were in danger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Misha opened her mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I forgot to tell you that it was not the evil dragon Veldora that destroyed us. It was someone else&rsquo;s nuclear magic that dealt a fatal blow to our army. Twice. It was a magic on a scale that could easily defeat legion magic. The wielder of that magic is a threat, but I have another point to make. That is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one needed to hear the end of it to understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora, the Storm Dragon, was still waiting in this land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio made the decision and gave the order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gather the men! Move out! We&rsquo;re all going home now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio shouted as if telling himself that this was not a retreat, but a march. He knew that this was sophistry, but if he did not think as such, he was afraid that he would be crushed by anxiety. It did not matter if it was sophistry or not, as long as he could escape from this situation. The soldiers thought so as well and tried to obey the order immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it was too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The situation had already begun to move. It became a raging current, a swirling torrent that swallowed up Calgurio and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fate of the imperial army&mdash;it had already been decided.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

My lord has decreed that you shall not be allowed to retreat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man appeared with ease, as if to interrupt the flustered command center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All eyes were drawn to the entrance of the tent. Standing there was a man in an exotic garb with a sword at his waist. His white hair, speckled with gold, was brushed back and tied up in a knot. He had a long white beard and a wrinkled face. However, his sharp eyes and straight, clean posture showed no signs of aging.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Krishna asked, stepping forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I beg your pardon. My name is Agera, sent by my lord Carrera-sama as a messenger on this occasion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man was Agera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru was a pacifist, for better or for worse, so it was decided to send an emissary to the enemy in order to recommend surrender.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Few expected the Imperial Army to accept, and more felt saddened by the losing a chance to perform. However, Agera, one of the few who had common sense, began to argue that it was the custom of the warrior class, and Geld also approved. Momiji did not object to this, so he was ordered to come as an emissary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This action was meant to buy time for the Tempest forces to get ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It did not matter whether the Imperial Army made a full stand or surrendered. However, they were not allowed to run away. All those who participated in this invasion would be punished. That was the decision that Rimuru had made.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera respected that decision. He had no intention of letting Calgurio and the others escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, one of the chief advisors spoke up to Agera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A messenger? You mean for Demon Lord Rimuru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera&rsquo;s expression turned grim for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How arrogant you are to call our great lord Rimuru by his name! You should reflect on this matter in the afterlife.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as he finished his words, the head of the soldier who had asked the question was lopped off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those present had not felt any sign that Agera had even drawn his sword. Even Krishna, who was closest to Agera, could not react at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a single sword stroke, Agera took control of the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While everyone else was silent, Agera delivered his demands in a clear and concise manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see you are ready to listen to me. In that case, I will tell you. Disarm and surrender immediately. You will be spared your lives as slaves. If you defy us, so be it. We will decide who wins in a show of valor. We will wait an hour. If you surrender, you have until then to make your decision.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With these words, Agera turned away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s brain began working frantically at this point to figure out what was best for him. Then, he decided to negotiate with Agera with a gleam of hope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait! No, excuse me. Please wait a moment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera stopped and turns to Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excuse me, my name is Calgurio. I am the head of this legion and the chief of this operation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. So, what can I do for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera was merely trying to buy time, so there was no hurry to rush back. He was not interested, but decided to listen to what Calgurio had to say anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon seeing Agera&rsquo;s reaction, Calgurio put all hope for negotiations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Agera-dono, you said earlier that if we surrendered, you would accept us. Slavery is too outrageous. It is a condition that I cannot accept.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s abrupt statement took the soldiers by surprise. However, no one there spoke out in opposition. They all understood the gravity of the situation and decided to put their hope in the future of this negotiation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taking advantage of Agera&rsquo;s silence, Calgurio continued speaking unilaterally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can win this war without any more damage than if we were to fight as dead soldiers. Instead of making us slaves, won&rsquo;t you let us off the hook? Of course, we will pay you compensation, and we promise to refrain from any further invasions. No, that&rsquo;s not all! I wish to go back to my country and ask His Imperial Majesty for an alliance with your country! If the empire and your country join forces, it will be easy to rule the world. We will be in a superior position against other demon lords, and it would not be a bad thing for His Majesty Demon Lord Rimuru, would it? We will not forget the debt. What do you think? Can&rsquo;t you please contact His Majesty? I am sure he would be happy to hear from you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio pleaded desperately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Considering the current situation, the Dwargon and labyrinth attacks were completely lost. All of the soldiers involved in the operation were dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only survivors were the less than 200,000 who were still here. By all accounts, this invasion had been a disaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Calgurio had no choice but to admit it. He wanted to return at least the survivors to their homeland in safety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This matter, and only this matter, was a responsibility Calgurio could take on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio finished what he had to say and waited for Agera&rsquo;s response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio understood that this was wishful thinking, but the odds are not completely against them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were greatly reduced in number from the beginning, but a little less than 200,000 was still a large army. They would be as big as the demon lord&rsquo;s army in terms of numbers, and it would be no fun for Demon Lord Rimuru to be outnumbered by such a large number of dead soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the ground, unlike in the labyrinth, death was final and they would not be brought back to life. Therefore, this proposal, which would give them a complete victory, would at least be worth considering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the very least, it was not the kind of proposal that Agera could simply respond to. It would surely be conveyed to Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once it was relayed to Demon Lord Rimuru, that was when the real work began. Even if it was unforgivable to let all of them go, they could negotiate to at least let some of them go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If possible, he would do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If he takes them into slavery, he will not take their lives. It is a lenient attitude, unlike most demon lords, but it might just help us this time. We can buy back the lower-ranked soldiers later. We must return to our home country and tell the situation to His Imperial Majesty at any cost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio thought so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He valued his life. But more importantly than that, he wanted to save as many of his soldiers as possible. And the information had to be brought to the emperor at all costs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was Calgurio&rsquo;s true intention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had underestimated the enemy&rsquo;s strength too much. This was the reason for the defeat, but in a sense, this was an inevitable outcome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dwargon, Tempest, and the Western Nations. He was confident that even if they faced these three forces at the same time, they would be able to win with their great power this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were confident of their victory, but the result was this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was impossible to imagine such a ridiculous story that Demon Lord Rimuru had several Disaster-class monsters under his control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s downfall was inevitable after this blunder, but any further loss of life could destroy even the very foundation of the empire. Calgurio should step down and bet on the future rebuilding of the empire, even if it meant abandoning his pride.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio was greedy, but he was not incompetent. That is why he offered up this proposal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Demon Lord Rimuru desires my life, then so be it. Someone will surely bring back the information to His Majesty Rudra. Then our defeat will at least have &nbsp;some meaning&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio went to the negotiating table, prepared to sacrifice himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it was already too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you really think you are in a position to give us conditions at this point? Your fate was decided the moment you refused Testarossa-sama&rsquo;s mercy. Resist or obey, and make your choice as you wish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was Agera&rsquo;s reply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera left the tent with ease. No one was able to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only words left at the end were &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about running away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha asked Calgurio, who stood there stunned and without words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a moment of silence&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;We can only fight. All our lives belong to the emperor. Slavery may prolong our lives, but we cannot disgrace His Imperial Majesty by accepting such humiliation!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Quietly and with determination, Calgurio made his decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But we have neither magic tanks nor magic cancelers. It will be a tough fight, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It will be fine. The objective is no longer survival but to bring back information to His Imperial Majesty! No matter how many generals we have to sacrifice, you alone must escape!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;?! Please wait!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what are you going to do then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That goes without saying. I will show those monsters my pride as an Imperial soldier!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio finally gave up his ego in the desperate situation. As a result, he regained his pride as a pure soldier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Calgurio&rsquo;s changed mood, the faces of his lieutenants and staff members also changed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No one would be so shameless as to leave you alone and run away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Isn&rsquo;t it interesting, this last desperate attempt?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is not yet decided that we will lose! This is where the Armored Corps really comes into its own!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were all talking in high spirits, and their morale was high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha let out a sigh in the midst of this atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, I&rsquo;m going to get out of here. I don&rsquo;t have such an auspicious character that I would accompany your suicide.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was like she was allowing herself to be hated, fluttering her hands in the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be fine if you have a connection with that Yuuki boy. Please inform His Imperial Majesty of my incompetence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood, my lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha returned a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one stopped Misha. No one could understand that her escape from this place would not be an easy one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You need someone to escort you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then we will take care of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Calgurio could finish, two figures appeared in the tent. It was Bernie and Jiwu, who had just escaped from the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Single Digits!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Krishna, it&rsquo;s been a long time. You&rsquo;ll die if you stay here&mdash;Do you want to come with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were all stunned by his words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;A Single Digit&rsquo;, the most powerful fighters in the empire, was speaking up in anticipation of defeat. This fact told them of the severity of the battle that awaited them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. I want to stay with Calgurio-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. Then I promise to tell His Imperial Majesty about your exploits&mdash;your deaths will not be in vain. You will die with honor. Do your best. There will surely be a meaning in it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie&rsquo;s words echoed heavily, and Jiwu silently agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They quickly withdrew from the scene, taking Misha with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who remained were prepared to die.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is not necessary to keep to the time specified by the messenger. We must strike with maximum force before the enemy forces are ready!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s order reached the end of the line in an instant. Everyone began to scramble to prepare for the final decisive battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

On the contrary, they were heavily outnumbered. They must not let their guard down. They could not afford to lose any casualties against wounded tigers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Second Corps, led by Geld, was to be on the defensive. They were to hold the front line and protect the firepower units in the rear. If they did so, they would be able to win the war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a tactic in which the dwarves excelled in. They would unleash their powerful offensive magic from inside the walled units.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a simple and clear tactic that suited Geld.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Fourth Corps was in charge of firepower, but it was led by Momiji of the Tengu clan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Victory for my husband!&rdquo; she encouraged the gathered members with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a very clever strategy to attack from the surroundings. Before one knew it, the moat would be filled and the enemy would be established.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld thought that Momiji might have Benimaru beat in the strategy aspect, though he was not be too far behind. If he really did not like it, he would have dealt with it long ago. Otherwise, the name of &lsquo;Generalissimo&rsquo; would not add up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem was that there were many women who admired Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most famous one was Alvis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fierce competition with Momiji was famous among the executives. Whether Momiji would be the winner or not remained to be seen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis had come to support Momiji this time as well, and Geld was not sure which one to support.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">In this case, there will always be those who will be saddened. It is best not to get too deep into it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld came to an uncharacteristic conclusion. He changed his mind and once again checked for any deficiencies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The support of the troops standing by in the rear was in perfect condition, and there were no problems with the means of attack. Not only the main force led by Momiji, but also the flank led by Shion, and the reinforcements led by Alvis were present.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for the coordination, he had no worries as long as Benimaru was there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As long as I fulfill my role, we will not be defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld&rsquo;s defenses were ironclad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The elite of the Yellow Numbers and Orange Numbers together numbered 17,000. These warriors were given iron-clad defense by Geld&rsquo;s Unique Skill &lsquo;Protector&rsquo;. In addition, the armors forged by Kurobee and Garm strengthened the strength of Geld&rsquo;s warriors to the extent that they could withstand shells.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was also a big advantage that Geld&rsquo;s Unique Skill &lsquo;Gourmet&rsquo;, Stomach, could be used by the whole corps. A few injuries could be healed by magic from the support troops in the rear, and even a serious injury could be healed immediately with the use of recovery medicine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In case of emergency, Geld&rsquo;s &lsquo;Stomach&rsquo; was always stocked with a large amount of recovery medicine. The Rimuru-produced restoratives were stockpiled not only for the current war, but for all contingencies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The quality of the potions did not deteriorate, so they were ideal for preservation. This time, they were allowed to use them without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Considering the concept of logistics, a unit that could replenish supplies on the spot without moving was extremely reliable. The monsters would function as a strong wall constructed by their own bodies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;There is no way we could lose&rsquo; Geld thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then there was also&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld turned his gaze skyward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">There he saw the military officer &ldquo;Carrera&rdquo; assigned to Geld&rsquo;s unit.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px;"><img alt="CARRERA IN THE SKY WITH MAGIC" src="images/image18.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c6 c38"><span class="c13 c2">Rimuru-sama is expectant of that power.

She had been assigned to the Second Corps with two of her companions, but now they were separated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru had given her the honor of the first attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld, a military man, had graciously accepted it and told her to do as she pleased. He was a very agreeable man, and Carrera knew she was in good company.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera had also received secret orders from Rimuru to protect Geld. Probably, Testarossa and Ultima had received the same. If there was someone in the Imperial Army who was too strong for the leaders to deal with, Carrera and her group&rsquo;s real role was to buy time by dealing with that person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now things were different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that she was in a position to take the lead, there was no reason for them to stay together. In fact, with Geld and the others playing the role of a wall, Carrera and the others had no place to play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first priority now was to think about how to destroy the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, Carrera intended to release nuclear magic from the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a moment, please! Carrera-sama, just what are you going to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera, who had just returned from his role as a messenger, rushed to stop Carrera. The cool-headedness he had just displayed against the imperial army was gone. In front of Carrera, Agera was just another struggling man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera rushed back to the base after a bad premonition, but it seems that he was right. The way he sensed Carrera&rsquo;s presence and read Carrera&rsquo;s behavior; he had a good intuition as a hard worker who had been trained for a long time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? Agera, are you back? I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it a lot, and I think I need to practice. That way, I won&rsquo;t fail in the real thing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera, who had been thinking of taking advantage of the absence of the noisemakers, did not seem to react at all to the interruption. This was a very clear evidence that this was a normal behavior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Practice, you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. Just a nuclear explosion in the sky, a little bit like a big firework, right? The residual heat will fry the ground a little, but it&rsquo;ll be fun. What do you think? This should work, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excellent, perfect! As expected of Carrera-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A girl standing by praised Carrera with a smug look on her face. That girl was Agera&rsquo;s equal partner&mdash;Esprit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had a lovely face, but her character was very bad. It was no exaggeration to say that she was the worst. Agera was also in a bind because of her strong ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, one would share the same hardships with their colleagues. However, Esprit was useless, following Carrera&rsquo;s lead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She never once scolded Carrera, but always acted according to Carrera&rsquo;s will. She was a vicious person who put Agera in an unfavorable role and acted as Carrera&rsquo;s cheerleader.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, all the hardships came to Agera, creating quite the unpleasant environment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa, who committed evil while maintaining reason, and Ultima, who pursued brutality, were also quite sickening. However, it was not a matter of being without malice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera, who always did her best without regard to the inconvenience to others, was also a troublesome lord from Agera&rsquo;s point of view.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not at all amusing to be laughed at for having caused a little too much damage. It was impossible for him to laugh with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, his colleague Esprit seemed to have no trouble with Carrera because they shared the same sensibility. This fact made Agera feel very envious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Saying that it&rsquo;s perfect&mdash;! You shut your mouth!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hardworking Agera shouted at the irresponsible Esprit for the time being. Then he turned to Carrera and began to explain carefully as if he were talking to a child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen, Carrera-sama, I&rsquo;ve just gone to the enemy camp as a messenger, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That being the case, it is a rule on the battlefield not to interfere until the time is right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? This is just a practice run.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s practice, what is no good is no good!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera, Agera&rsquo;s boss, had the personality of a runaway car without brakes. It was very difficult to stop her. Her power was so overwhelming that it was hard to deal with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had been inciting Demon Lord Leon on a regular basis. She shot nuclear magic every day and repeatedly provoked him. If it had been another demon lord, a war would have started long ago and Carrera would have wreaked havoc and ended up back in the demon world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera&rsquo;s purpose in life was momentary pleasure, so she did not care about victory or defeat in war. Therefore, even if she lost, she would just disappear with a big smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because she herself would not think she had lost, it would not do any damage and would not lead to any remorse. How could he teach Carrera common sense? This was Agera&rsquo;s big problem until a while ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now things were different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Until now, there was no one who could give an order to Agera and his comrades, who were the upper class of the most powerful demons, the ruling class. And against Carrera, who even had those ruling class of demons as her followers, it was a matter of risking one&rsquo;s life just to express an opinion to Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera was allowed to follow Carrera without being erased from existence only because Carrera liked him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, however, Carrera had become a subordinate of the Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera thought that in the future, it would be necessary to learn patience in order to make a good impression on Demon Lord Rimuru. She would have to use her head, not her intuition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What he needed to do was to help his boss Carrera learn common sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, Carrera had learned the laws and regulations, and had even been able to deal with them correctly. That being the case, Agera hoped that Carrera would think and act a little more in her daily life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">If she does, it will ease my hardships a little, won&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With such a modest wish in mind, Agera strove every day to persuade Carrera. Therefore, Agera took this opportunity to preach to Carrera on the points of issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the outside, Agera looked like a grandfather who was scolding his granddaughter, but he didn&rsquo;t care about that. He continued his explanation believing that this was his chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His words were easy to understand and concise. This was very difficult for Carrera, who was easily bored and did not listen to others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera explained to Carrera the customs of war in a very detailed manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, the imperial army began to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, there&rsquo;s still a lot of time left before the time Agera-kun promised, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, indeed&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then does that mean that while I was listening to Agera-kun&rsquo;s boring story, the Empire slipped by?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera was nervous. It was due to two things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera was usually one to take things easy, but when she gets angry, she goes beyond outbursts and explodes. If Agera was the target of her anger, he would have to give up any hopes of survival.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other was his anger towards the empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had taught Carrera the rules of warfare, and now they had ruined them. Agera was angry for the first time in a long time at this betrayal of the empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Carrera-sama! Let&rsquo;s leave the old man alone and educate those fools who can&rsquo;t even keep their promises!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;You should be thankful, you fool!&rsquo; said Esprit while she pointed at the imperial army to get Carrera&rsquo;s attention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld and his men formed a line.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A controlled army of nearly 200,000 troops was closing in on them. From the air, they looked like nothing more than bait.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera nodded her head smugly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shall we do it? Agera, of course you won&rsquo;t stop me, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was asking a question with a fierce tone, as if she would kill him if he stopped her. However, Agera&rsquo;s reaction was different from what Carrera had expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed&hellip;I told them to wait for an hour, but I did not say that they should not attack until then. It seems that I am responsible for this mishap.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is part of a warrior&rsquo;s duty to intercede for those who wish to die. Do not go easy on them. I think you should do as you please.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera, too, was ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was a gentle man, unlike most demons, but he hated it when his lord was mocked or when promises were broken. The empire had caught Agera&rsquo;s displeasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I like it. How exciting. That&rsquo;s why I like you so much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera was no longer restrained. Carrera noticed this and laughed with delight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s begin. Let me show you what happens when they try to make fools of us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the war began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The empire did not know that their actions were tantamount to authorizing their own executions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then&hellip;let&rsquo;s make it rain nuclear magic, shall we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea! Explosions blooming on the ground, how wonderful!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then they learned&hellip;that if you provoke the meek&hellip;the retribution may result in the extreme.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s too lukewarm. Carrera-sama, I would like you to remember the words of our Lord. Didn&rsquo;t he say to &lsquo;use your flashy magic to knock the emperor&rsquo;s army&rsquo;s lights out&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I believe that showing our full strength is the only way to comply with his wishes, my lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera&rsquo;s eyes widened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera&rsquo;s words were right on the money. And now, Agera himself, who always tried to stop Carrera&rsquo;s outbursts by making small complaints, was now telling Carrera to give it her all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera was deeply moved by this realization.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Agera. Your words have woken me up. All right, let&rsquo;s show them what we&rsquo;ve got! I&rsquo;ll show off the magic which I&rsquo;ve never succeeded in doing before!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera was fully motivated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh crap&mdash;only then, did Agera regained his composure, but now it was too late. Carrera had turned her attention to the magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just what are you going to do?&mdash;Esprit stared at him, but Agera didn&rsquo;t know what to do. They would all just have to wait and see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if Carrera went out of control and got in trouble later, they would only have time to think about it. He decided to just enjoy the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera was still a demon, after all.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, the imperial army, which had begun its march, was destroyed by an attack from the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Multilayer Barriers by legion magic, anti-magic defense by state-of-the-art equipment, high resistance to magic of each individual, and many sacred blessings were all generously invested. All of these defensive measures became powerless in the face of Carrera&rsquo;s large-scale annihilation magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This magic is a kind of nuclear magic: Gravity Collapse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This magic, which boasted the greatest and most powerful strength among all nuclear magic, required a huge amount of magicules and precise Magic Power Manipulation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the Abyssal Core, which was the key to the magic, was left unattended, it would expand and produce Nuclear Flame. Gravity Collapse was a forbidden magic formed by suppressing and compressing it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What this compression meant was that a super gravity was created. To put it simply, one could say that she had created an artificial black hole.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The magnetic field of gravity of a star was disrupted, and a localized supergravity force field was generated there. All those who were caught within the sphere of influence of the limited super-compressed space would be crushed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fate of the imperial army exposed to such a magic was, needless to say, disastrous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of a sudden, gravity began increasing in power as if it had gone mad. The Imperial soldiers were crushed by the effects of the magic, unable to bear even their own weight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The open clearing was a curse, and there was no way to escape the demon&rsquo;s eyes. More than 80 percent of the nearly 200,000-strong army was trapped within the magical sphere of influence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers were now unable to move, but the real work of this magic was only just beginning. A storm of mana blew through the precisely designated area. It was an inverted tempest like no one had ever seen before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The super-compressed space reached its breaking point, and soon all the energy was concentrated into a single point. Once it reversed, a small supernova appeared on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A jet-black pillar connecting the heavens and the earth&mdash;it seemed as if the gates of hell had been opened, with the dust and sediment that had been swept up to the stratosphere by the massive explosion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was no longer the level of magic to be used on a planet. If the area had not been specified, the entire Great Jura Forest would have been scorched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no one in the imperial army strong enough to resist it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was only natural.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This nuclear magic &lsquo;Gravity Collapse&rsquo; was an all-attribute attack that engulfed all magic and physical phenomena.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, most of the Imperial Army disappeared into dust before even understanding what had happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera was satisfied with that blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The troubled one was Agera, who had come to his senses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since he was the one who had encouraged her to do this, he could not complain. However, Agera never imagined that she would create such a disaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, it was more correct to say that he had thought &lsquo;this might be bad&rsquo;, but still had no idea that Carrera&rsquo;s power was so great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even now he was still wondering what he should do, but it was too late now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hardships of the hard working Agera had only just begun.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

He had expected Carrera to be strong, but this strength was just unimaginable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I never thought she could obliterate so many enemies with a single blow. We will never get a chance to play a part in the battle.&rdquo; Geld complained in that way, but he did not mean it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In spite of the confusion, there were more than 20,000 survivors of the Imperial Army. All of them were desperately trying to escape from the death zone and were coming towards Geld.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The numbers disadvantage had been overcome, but this was no time to be complacent. Geld knew this all too well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Imperial Army, seeing the fear of death in their eyes, would charge at them in a desperate attempt to kill them. That pressure was not half-baked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Geld was unmoved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps because of the calmness of their commander, all of Geld&rsquo;s men, down to the very end, were calm and focused on the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shields up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Geld gave a solemn order when there was only a short time left before the two armies made contact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Second Corps reacted with a single, unwavering movement. In the next instant, they formed a wall that no one could penetrate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In spite of the fierce clash, Geld and his men did not retreat even a single step, and they caught the imperial troops. After that, Geld&rsquo;s wall never once collapsed, and they pushed back the imperial army without retreating a single step.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The final battle began, and the next move was made by Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Charge! Let us slaughter all the enemies of Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion&rsquo;s guard, led by the &ldquo;Yomigaeri,&rdquo; let out a shout as a signal. Immediately after that, as many as 10,000 majin of various kinds began to take action in their own way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were trained by Shion and claimed to be her fans. Led by the &ldquo;Yomigaeri,&rdquo; they appeared to be united in their actions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their fighting ability was noteworthy, as was their number.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of them had the Extra Skill &lsquo;Mortal Fear&rsquo;, which was a power of Shion, given through the &ldquo;Yomigaeri&rdquo;. Ten thousand majin turned into Terror Knights and attacked the imperial army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They incited the enemy&rsquo;s fear and made them lose the will to fight. This was the essence of Extra Skill &lsquo;Mortal Fear&rsquo;. The effect of this skill was enormous, because it blocked the true strength of the enemy forces and allowed them to unleash their own one-sided violence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wearing the matching navy-blue armor forged by Garm, the eldest of the three brothers, the Shion Guard rampaged on the battlefield. Their appearance was the stuff of nightmares for the imperial army.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most eye-catching among them were the three giants, who released huge amounts of youki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had assimilated Shion&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mortal Fear&rsquo; with their own youki, and were on the rampage as incarnations of violence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were, of course, the three sons of Demon Lord Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The others were no different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taking full advantage of their death-resistance, the &ldquo;Yomigaeri&rdquo; caught the attention of their enemies. While in this situation, the other majin would take care of the enemy. By doing so, they steadily reduced the number of enemy forces without causing any damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobzo was one of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, my head is getting all mushy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was calmly saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; but there was a hole in his head where he had been stabbed by a sword. It was a horrifying experience for those who were not used to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Gobzo-san for you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. That blow would have killed me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobzo&rsquo;s subordinates were impressed by his growth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the meantime, three whirlpools were forming on the battlefield with Dagruel&rsquo;s sons at the center. With this as a starting point, the left side of the empire had begun to collapse. The imperial generals began to be pushed by the surging forces of Shion&rsquo;s guard, which did not miss them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the Imperial Guard, in their desperation and in the heat of battle, were no match for Shion&rsquo;s Yomigaeri.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they were comparing individual fighting abilities, there was not much difference in their capabilities. However, there was an overwhelming gap in the level of their skills, and the Yomigaeri were superior in terms of skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What kind of training was required to achieve this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The members of the Yomigaeri showed an amazingly specialized combat performance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion was very active on the right flank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the right side of the Imperial Army, there was also a turbulence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No&hellip;how?! How can there be&mdash;splat!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;B-Beast Master&rsquo;s Warrior Alliance&hellip;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to die&mdash;agh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Beast Master&rsquo;s Warrior Alliance and the majins under the Beast King had come as reinforcements. All of them were giving their all in order to repay Rimuru for his great favor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a true monster.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At Alvis&rsquo;s muttering, the elephant beastman Zor nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A great magic, the likes of which had never been seen or heard before, was unfolding before our eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The pillar of horror connecting heaven and earth burned more than a hundred thousand imperial generals to ashes in an instant. Still, its power did not diminish, and it was left to reveal its fury on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With this blow, victory was assured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only question that remained was whether or not there were any strongmen lurking or inn hiding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the reason why they had not allowed the enemy to escape in the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alvis, who was aware of Rimuru&rsquo;s usual mild-mannered character, was horrified by the thoroughness of this policy. At the same time, she was deeply convinced that this was how a demon lord should be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We rushed over here with 20,000 troops for support, but they were so easily overpowered. We can&rsquo;t claim to be repaying a favor like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was not the kind of thing that could be repaid, of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. In that case, we can at least avoid making His Majesty Rimuru unhappy. Death is out of the question. Do everything you can so that no one gets hurt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You heard him, everyone! With the pride of being under the Beast King&rsquo;s command, do not let up and give it your all until the very end!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zor roared, and the Beast Master&rsquo;s Warrior Alliance responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the beasts began their march on the right flank of the imperial army.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, the momentum was clear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rear of the army was now in the grip of a great magical fury, and both the right and left flanks of the army were thoroughly overrun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Imperial Army was now merely waiting to be surrounded and annihilated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Momiji looked upon this situation with cold eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her head was calm, but her heart was burning fiercely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time. With the fire of compassion, let us save our enemies from the sea of suffering.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She muttered to herself and signaled to Gobua.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same moment, the Fourth Corps united their breaths and began to raise their demonic aura.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Through Gobua, the command was transmitted to the &ldquo;Kurenai&rdquo;, and a &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; was sent to each member. Then, as if in a reversal, all of the youki raised by each member was transmitted to &ldquo;Kurenai&rdquo;, and they all harmonized beautifully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Momiji&rsquo;s role was to unite them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure about this?&rdquo; Gobua asked a little anxiously. Momiji, however, simply laughed it off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am going to be Benimaru-sama&rsquo;s wife, what will I do if I am unable to do something to this extent?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was an unshakable confidence in her attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bound youki was being further concentrated into a single force to be used as a firepower against the enemy forces. This was Momiji&rsquo;s proposal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a simple and clear-cut plan, but if the integration of the youki failed, it might cause an outburst. If that happened, Geld and the others who were keeping the front line would be affected. It was natural for Gobua to be worried, but she was silenced by Momiji&rsquo;s confidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Momiji was entrusted with the army as Benimaru&rsquo;s deputy. To doubt Momiji was tantamount to saying that she did not trust Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, I leave it to you. Shall we begin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s not as powerful as the magic that Carrera-san unleashed, but it is good enough for the rest of us. We will show them with this single blow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Momiji then unveiled her once-in-a-lifetime great technique.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will bloom a red lotus flower that softly and gently envelopes the enemy. Now, watch carefully. Heavenly Beast Red Flame&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a red flower blooming in the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its primary purpose was to rapidly burn oxygen. By doing so, it deprived the ground of oxygen and rendered the enemies inoperable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second purpose was to pour down flames of mercy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The high temperature would make the enemy unconscious before it could cause them pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The third objective was to force out the powerful enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the enemy could withstand this attack, they would be classified as a strong opponent. This magic was perfect for eliminating those who were in the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The flower that bloomed on the battlefield continuously fell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were no survivors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? I&rsquo;m disappointed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was expected. The last ones to invade the labyrinth were superior to all the others. Perhaps they were the trump card of the imperial army.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, indeed. Now all that&rsquo;s left is the enemy command center.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That, too, will be over soon. After all&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course. If someone who is like that Carrera-san has gone out there, there won&rsquo;t be single opponent who can be a match for him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. The battle is now ours.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if on cue, the battlefield erupted in cheers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle of annihilation, as the name of the decisive battle implied, had thus ended without incident.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

No, he didn&rsquo;t need to receive any more reports. A catastrophe had already occurred right before their eyes. The only thing they seemed to be lucky about was that the events were so fleeting that everyone died without fear or remorse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, those who survived the horrifying magic came running back to the main camp with their eyes wide open in despair. They had experienced soul-crushing horror, and they carried in their hearts a distrust of the empire as they lamented their own foolishness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With no time for words, the staff generals shouted for retreat. But now, it was impossible for them to survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">How did this happen? Should I have chosen the path of slavery? No, when exactly did I make a mistake in the first place&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio tried desperately and unsuccessfully to get his spinning thoughts back to normal and once again looked at the hopeless war situation and considered the possible strategies available to him now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no such thing. There was no way he could come up with such a convenient strategy at this late stage. No, rather than that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&hellip;What is that? What the hell is that?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio was in a crucible of fear and confusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such evil magic was beyond his comprehension.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could it kill hundreds of thousands of soldiers protected by so many &lsquo;barriers&rsquo; as if twisting a baby&rsquo;s hand?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nearly 200,000 men were destroyed with a single blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only a matter of time before the rest of them were wiped out as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What if&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a theoretical magic that can interfere with the gravity of stars. This magic, which is the most powerful and the worst among all the magic classified as nuclear magic, requires an enormous amount of energy, and must be precisely controlled to be realized&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I remember hearing that from Gadra. Gravity Collapse, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, Calgurio had heard about that too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a magic that was still under study, but it was theoretically possible. It was not a magic that had been confirmed in the past, but one that had been studied from the very beginning, with the best of the Empire&rsquo;s technology and the scientific knowledge of other worlds, and then abandoned as the theory was being constructed&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a strategic level magic that could annihilate not only the battlefield, but also a nation. However, it should have been concluded that it was impossible to realize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, they had succeeded in perfectly invoking it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A single monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words reach Calgurio&rsquo;s brain with a real sense of dread. &lsquo;We have touched something we should never have touched,&rsquo; he wanted to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am impressed by Calgurio-sama&rsquo;s knowledge.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio was jolted back to reality by the nosy voice of one of his advisors. Then Calgurio shouted, as if taking it out on him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just theoretical magic! Gadra boasted that he could slaughter Veldora if he was able to use it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s how powerful that magic is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before long, the general staff was divided into two groups.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&hellip;kind of monster? It&rsquo;s only&hellip;Just a single creature can do that kind of magic&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some went into a state of panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Great. Hahaha! I&rsquo;ll write my paper when I get back! Now we can have that forbidden spell!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And some discussed with each other like mad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One group had lost their will to fight and the other group was running away from reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The command center had already lost its function.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was nothing that could be done in the worst situation. But Calgurio was still the commander of the corps. He was responsible for the lives of the remaining soldiers. To throw this situation away was something Calgurio could never do. However, he was not in a position to retreat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Including those who were running away, there were less than 2,000 soldiers left in the main camp. They were out of control, and even if they escaped, they would be slaughtered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio desperately wanted power, more power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the empire had always done, all was forgiven when one was strong. It was only with overwhelming power that the world could be pacified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the end for those without power was dire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Needless to say, this was obvious in Calgurio&rsquo;s current situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the top of the empire were the &ldquo;three generals&rdquo;, and Calgurio was proud to be a ranked among them. However, he had finally realized that it was all a lie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">How helpless I was! How incompetent. What a weak man I am. I never realized that I was in such a miserable position, only to be exploited&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He couldn&rsquo;t help but lament.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wealth, fame, and all such things were worthless under the current circumstances. The most important thing was what one needed when they were in real trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want power&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nearly a million soldiers had died believing in the glory of the empire and, by extension, in Calgurio as their commander-in-chief. Faced with this fact, Calgurio was devastated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sir, I have a report! A huge flame was seen over the battlefield. The heat levels we&rsquo;re seeing indicate that those on the ground are not likely to survive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over. The empire is now completely defeated&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The staff generals fell silent as the deputy muttered something like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The escapees were also stunned, as if waking up from a dream. They tried to face the reality that awaited them, but their brains refused to accept it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will offer our surrender. It is a gamble whether they will accept it or not, but there is a chance that they will find it useful. If we don&rsquo;t, they will kill us all anyway. I think it&rsquo;s our only chance of survival, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was better to be a slave than to die. That was the idea of someone who thought so, but he could not help feeling that it is a little late for that. Calgurio, however, decided to accept the proposal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Agreed. It may be futile, but we can try to negotiate. At least, if we can turn the enemy&rsquo;s attention to us, we will have a better chance of Misha and the others escaping.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if it ended in their deaths, as long as the information was delivered to the empire, this defeat would have some meaning. This was the reason for their reluctant approval.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s heart was already shattered, despite his modesty, as was typical of him. But because he was that way, he was able to think about what was best in this situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he had reached this state of mind earlier, Calgurio would have been a great general of rare distinction. So much so that Calgurio, having abandoned his desires and vanities, had regained his original intelligence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now it was too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was already no hope left for Calgurio and his comrades.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu&hellip;Surrender&hellip;that&rsquo;s no good. You&rsquo;ll have to deal with me for a while.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo, who had been in the tent for some time, spoke up as he appeared. He was dressed in his butler&rsquo;s uniform as usual and had a smile on his beautiful face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment Calgurio saw Diablo, he could see the absolute difference in power. Now that he had regained his cool judgment, he was not about to throw away his life in a moment of petty pride.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has his guards lower their swords, saying that the first thing to do was to negotiate. It was the right thing to do, since a fight would inevitably end in defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Out of the corner of Calgurio&rsquo;s eye, Krishna was saying, &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&hellip;&rdquo; and cowering. Like Calgurio, Krishna must have felt the overwhelming difference in ability and despaired.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio, feeling that he had made the right choice, decided to be the first to identify himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My name is Calgurio, and I am the chief of this operation. May I ask your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo replied happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? That&rsquo;s very kind of you. My name is Diablo, a loyal servant of Demon Lord Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo loved to say his own name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Faced with such a Diablo, Calgurio began to think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no way they could defeat Diablo. Even if everyone in the command center tried, it would be impossible to win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The presence of this demon was denser than that of a huge dragon. The haki emanating from his body was more overwhelming than that of the Demon Lord Clayman, who had been friends with Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, Diablo had appeared here without giving any sign of his presence. That is to say, he had invaded without leaving any trace of this tremendous haki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s heart was as quiet as if it were calm, despite the appearance of such an absolutely powerful being.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is our chance. He does not seem to be willing to allow our surrender, but he is open to negotiation. If we can buy time, we can keep this dangerous man at bay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio decided that this would increase the safety of Misha and the others who had fled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he was too naive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu&hellip;Are you thinking of stalling for time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There was someone who escaped from here, so you&rsquo;re being used as the decoy. It&rsquo;s a very nice idea of self-sacrifice, but unfortunately, it&rsquo;s useless. Because we&rsquo;ve already taken care of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A demon would sneak up on them and never let their pathetic prey escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if to prove it, Diablo laughed. Then he pulled out two dead bodies from an empty space and laid them on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Could that be the Single Digits&hellip;?!&rdquo; Krishna exclaimed in shock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bodies belonged to Bernie and Jiwu.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tensions ran high in the command center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Krishna was not the only one shocked. Everyone there understood exactly what a Single Digit&rsquo;s defeat meant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They couldn&rsquo;t beat Diablo. No, it was more than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">H-How&hellip;Then our deaths&hellip;the deaths of all the soldiers&hellip;will have no meaning at all!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A deep despair gripped Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All of you, draw your swords! There is an intruder! We shall kill the intruder!&rdquo; the second-in-command shouted, and his guards answered him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike Krishna, the guards were not aware of Diablo&rsquo;s strength. Therefore, they reacted without knowing that their actions were too reckless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu&hellip; Do you think that you, lowly fools, can fight me on equal terms?&rdquo; Diablo laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the second-in-command was not to be outdone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up, you demon! There are still more than 1,000 warriors in the field. No matter how strong you are, what can you do with just one of you!&rdquo; The second lieutenant is trying desperately to mask his fear with anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio couldn&rsquo;t move. He wanted to scream for them to stop, but he couldn&rsquo;t speak. What could he do with just one person, he had asked? Even though he was tempted to shout&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio now understood what strength was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He understood what Emperor Rudra had wanted for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A single strong being can defeat an army of a million.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The proof of this was the supreme magic the enemy had just released.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the fact that a Single Digit&hellip;that a monster could kill two of those strong beings&hellip;meant that he could easily destroy the Armored Corps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The proof of that was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu. That sentence came a little too late. You are the only survivors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The deputy did not seem to comprehend what was being said. But Calgurio knew what was going on outside even without seeing it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been bothering him for a while.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was too quiet outside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Diablo snapped his fingers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, the tent blew away. Calgurio and the others were able to the scene outside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a pile of dead bodies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All the soldiers were dead as if they were sleeping.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, as if only their souls had been taken out&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, Calgurio realized, that was exactly what had happened. Before the soldiers could even resist, Diablo had taken their souls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now once again. That tragedy would be replayed before their eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo snapped his fingers and Krishna and the others fell to the ground.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c8 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px;"><img alt="DIABLO THE INEVITABLE" src="images/image14.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio&rsquo;s heart was filled with despair and sadness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;U-Uh&hellip;uh&hellip;uwaaaaaah&hellip;!!&rdquo; he screamed, crying tears of blood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Immediately after that, Calgurio&rsquo;s emotions saturated and exploded&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

He found the enemy&rsquo;s headquarters by looking for Krishna&rsquo;s presence, and looked into the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bernie and the others had arrived there, and Diablo, who had no intention of letting any of them escape, naturally took action to eliminate them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were stronger than he had expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, well, well&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t know that even if I had trained my Unique Skill to the maximum, it wouldn&rsquo;t work. But it seems that it was a borrowed power. It was unbalanced, or rather, I don&rsquo;t think they have awakened to their abilities yet. In that case, there is a way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo had taken out the two with a fairly comfortable margin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misha, seeing this, had come out that she was Yuuki&rsquo;s subordinate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Rimuru had given his tacit approval for the joint fight with Yuuki, it was unthinkable for Diablo to go against Rimuru&rsquo;s will. Therefore, he let Misha off the hook.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c13">But was that an Ultimate Skill? I was annoyed when Guy boasted about it a long time ago, but it is worth studying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo, who has stopped weighing himself against becoming stronger, was able to throw away his stubbornness with aplomb. Diablo was a demon that could use anything as long as it was effective towards his goals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo, interested in Ultimate Skill in such a way, did not forget about his job.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He returned to the imperial army and invaded with ease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, not wanting to cause any trouble, he took the lives of anyone who caught his eye with the &ldquo;End of the World&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Quick and indiscriminate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He killed all of the enemy soldiers without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio roared before Diablo&rsquo;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; Diablo laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio had pushed the limits of humanity. He must have had talent to begin with. Now that he had surpassed the Sage level, his energy level were increasing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ah, an awakening out of despair. The sense of guilt seems to have brought him to a higher level. That is why you are worthy to fight me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo had never been interested in getting stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, he wanted power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be of use to the one he served&mdash;to be a useful tool for his master Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Diablo, a tool was meaningless if it did not show its ability to the Lord. He believed that a useless tool was not worth its existence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the reason why he did not have his own subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had always preferred to be alone, as he had no need for incompetent subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was because Diablo was such a man that he never forgot about his own ambitions in being competent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A battle against the strong was an opportunity that Diablo could not have wished for.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Calgurio awakened with that feeling. He was filled with power. It was a power like nothing he had ever experienced before, a power of epic proportions.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Overwhelming,&rsquo; Calgurio thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anger, despair, and fear at the murder of his comrades had become the key to shattering his own limitations. And that power must have been the expectation that Emperor Rudra had placed in Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have high hopes for you.&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">Rudra had personally told him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio ha never forgotten that day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had always thought that he would be the head of a legion and serve the empire. But this was a misinterpretation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oh, I see. So His Majesty, Rudra-sama, wanted me to be awakened!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once he realized this, he understood that everything he had done did have meaning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now Calgurio had gone beyond Sage to Saint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cell by cell, his spirit overtook his flesh. Calgurio could understand the transformation of his own body. A tremendous power comparable to that of an awakened demon lord. Calgurio, awakened by the power, realized how incompetent he had been before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before this power, the Armored Corps was nothing. In other words, the imperial army could never defeat the demon lord or Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-I was a fool&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu&hellip; You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But that is exactly why! I swear I will right my wrongs!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Calgurio shouted this, his body was enveloped in shining, divine armor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The best armament since mythical times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A mythical-grade armor lent to him by the emperor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only the Marshal and three generals were allowed to wear this armor, and it was the proof of the highest power of the Empire. It now recognized Calgurio as its true master.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forgive you, demon! I will destroy you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufu, that&rsquo;s what makes it interesting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, the two sides clashed with each other, and the final battle began.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio pushed himself to the limit of his strength, and from the first attack, he threw out his all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A fist protected by a cuirass was a deadly weapon by itself. It had the most destructive power, shattering almost all the materials in the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The speed of the tip of his fist exceeded the speed of sound, reaching a mythical realm that did not even leave an afterimage. The shockwave broke through the defenses of matter and destroyed molecular bonds. And the energy contained in the fist could pass through the mental barrier and damage the astral body. In other words, he could kill even a spiritual life form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio knew of the name Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the Four Heavenly Kings of Demon Lord Rimuru, he was an evil demon. Unbelievably, the report had described him as a legendary &ldquo;demon peer&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio used to mock the intelligence agency&rsquo;s findings, but now he believed the report to be true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Single Digits were the only ones who could challenge them, and yet both were defeated. It was no wonder that he was such a fearsome existence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Calgurio&rsquo;s fear was now gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">I admit that he is a fearsome devil, but he is not my enemy now. With this power, I will defeat every &ldquo;True Dragon&rdquo;, &ldquo;demon lord&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Hero&rdquo;!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If a person&rsquo;s power was considered to be 1, the physical ability of a person who was designated as A rank was at least 10 or more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a greater majin, it was close to 100.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An archdemon had a record of 140.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If one was a demon lord, they must be at least 300.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">True dragons were unmeasurable, but they were estimated to be over 1000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, Calgurio realized that his power exceeded 1000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a world where only those who have awakened to sainthood could reach. Moreover, Calgurio was clad in a mythical-grade armor that contained energy comparable to his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With this power, he could destroy even a &ldquo;demon peer&rdquo;. It was not surprising that Calgurio felt so convinced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alas, how disappointing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His fist was lightly swatted away by Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How can this be?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is there to wonder about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wh-Why are you still alive?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A blow like that should have destroyed any demon. He could not accept such a ridiculous story that he was completely unharmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, you ask? The reason is simple. You are not skilled enough to handle your power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo answered as if it were nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t handle it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I, for one, personally feel very sorry. It&rsquo;s too early to fight you. The other two were stronger. They may have been borrowing the Ultimate Skill, but they still had it in their bodies. If you had awakened to that power earlier, we would have had a much more enjoyable fight&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fruits must ripen before they can be eaten. Diablo lamented that he had reaped the harvest too soon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was an insult Calgurio did not want to admit to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn you! Don&rsquo;t you dare, you demon!&rdquo; he shouted, but the situation was worse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio understood in his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He understood that he was no match for the demon in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And above all, he understood the secret of the power of the &ldquo;Single Digits&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The greatest warriors of the empire had been selected by Emperor Rudra and lent their ultimate power to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was confirmed by Diablo&rsquo;s word &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo did not understand it because it was not power that he had acquired on his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how great the power was, it was meaningless unless one understood the essence of their power and mastered it. This was true for Calgurio himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo&rsquo;s statement that it was too early to fight him was a reality that could not be denied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoo, o-ooooh, oooooohhh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He realized that he could not win. Still, Calgurio did his best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he did not at least try to avenge them, all of their actions would have been in vain. To deny this, Calgurio fought recklessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it could not be called a battle anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Diablo, who had rightly uncovered Calgurio&rsquo;s capabilities, this was now nothing more than a chore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even his mythical-grade armor, with all its power, was unable to fully exploit Calgurio&rsquo;s current capabilities. He was recognized as the master, but they did not understand each other enough to harmonize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The mythical-grade armor had a will. Calgurio had not had enough time to accumulate enough time to become a true master.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A tool was meaningful only when one knew how to use it. There was nothing sadder than a tool that could not be used to its full potential.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, Calgurio, the last man in the imperial army, was defeated without being able to bring out Diablo&rsquo;s true potential.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then his soul was reaped.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image22.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1128.82px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.88px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.2s8eyo1"><span class="c5 c22">Epilogue</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c25">The Doing of a Demon Lord</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Calgurio awoke, feeling his body enveloped in a warm and comfortable sensation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">W-where am I?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He could not recall what he had been doing until now. Calgurio quickly glanced at his surroundings in panic. It was then that he realized that he had been lying in a spacious room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was there that a silverish blue-haired young girl, about twelve or thirteen, was doing something while bearing an angelic smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio looked in her direction to find that she was putting her hands above the people lying on the ground. Rainbow-like light began to emit from her hands and enveloped Calgurio&rsquo;s companions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Is that Krishna-dono? Wait, no, I saw Krishna-dono being killed right in front of me&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he was still having trouble processing things, he recalled the situation. Calgurio realized that he and his army had been waging a war invading the monster kingdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Panicked, he tried to rise and shout to alert, yet words could not escape his mouth as Krishna, who should already be dead, slowly opened his eyes and met with those of Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The newly awakened Krishna reacted similarly to Calgurio, he seemed just as unaware about his situation too. Confused, his eyes began to follow the movements of the young girl as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The blue-haired young girl didn&rsquo;t seem to realize either of them had woken up as she continued to carry out the same procedure as before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In front of her lay Bonnie and Jiwu. Next to them were Calgurio&rsquo;s adjutants and tacticians.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">W-what is going on here&hellip; They were supposed to have died too&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though his mind was in chaos, Calgurio still quickly accepted the facts of the situation calmly. Yet he could not explain the phenomenon that was taking place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, they all should have been dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was not the slightest movement on their chest, so they were obviously not breathing. Yet as the young girl&rsquo;s hand hovered above them, they began to regain life one by one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were around a dozen imperial officers in this room, and in a short while, everyone was given the same procedure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young girl finally nodded with satisfaction as she turned her head to Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yo, have you woken up? How do you feel? Do you still remember your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young girl said so to Calgurio in a rather smug tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it was not irritating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was likely due to the petite look of the young girl, but perhaps the most important reason was that Calgurio could not seem to bring himself to detest the aura the young girl was giving off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Though he was still unable to properly make a reaction in response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still unclear of their current situations, everyone decided to keep their mouths shut.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the &ldquo;Single Digits&rdquo; Bernie and Jiwu looked oblivious and completely stunned at the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing how confused Calgurio and everyone looked, the young girl spoke up softly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, did I mess it up? The spell was pretty perfect in theory&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A rather puzzled look emerged on her face.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px;"><img alt="" src="images/image19.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Calgurio finally realized that they were all being cast under some sort of spell. In his mind, he was pondering whether the spell could have been&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">N-No way, that&rsquo;s insane, there&rsquo;s no way, it&rsquo;s not possible, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t feel anything strange with his body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;No, actually, there was something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio had previously boosted his power immensely, yet after waking up, he felt that all the power he had gained had disappeared. He could only imagine what terrifying things had taken place prior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Excuse me, but shouldn&rsquo;t we be dead already?&rdquo; Calgurio asked fearfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, his fellow companions began to regain their memories too. Eyes wide open, all of them had begun to sense that things were not right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio and them should have already been killed by the demon that called himself Diablo. There was no reason why he would have spared them, that&rsquo;s why Calgurio had been doubtful as to whether he was still living now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, are you regaining your memories? So do you still remember your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, umm, my name is Calgurio.&rdquo; As he answered, Calgurio thought of another possibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps this young maiden had saved Calgurio and the rest from their imminent death. There was no way that she could have rescued them from that situation without quite the able body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That demon was an unimaginably powerful opponent, even when Calgurio obtained extraordinary power. The demon defeated Calgurio almost as easy as twisting an infant&rsquo;s hand. Moreover, even the &ldquo;Single Digit&rdquo; individuals like Bernie were also&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If anyone could have taken on a demon like that, Calgurio could only think of the legendary &ldquo;Hero&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;C-could it be that you were the one who saved us? W-What about the demon? What happened to that evil demon?&rdquo; Calgurio summoned up his courage and asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as he finished his sentence&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How dare you act so rude to Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those words were uttered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The voice was familiar, thought Calgurio, it was just like that of the demon&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bigger problem was the name Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, Calgurio and the others&rsquo; goal in this invasion was to fight against the demon lord with that very same name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The demon named Diablo appeared before Calgurio. He couldn&rsquo;t help but tense his body in fear. It was then that the young girl intervened and stopped Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uhh&mdash;some of you seem to have gotten things mixed up, so allow me to explain. You were all dead, your army was completely obliterated and none of the soldiers survived, or I at least I figured there weren&rsquo;t any. So I didn&rsquo;t exactly save any of you, I only revived you all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu, a truly splendid skill. I ask not for your gratitude, but do be impressed by Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s great deeds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What the hell are they talking about</span><span class="c1">, Calgurio couldn&rsquo;t help but give out an audible confusion. Yet no one was able to make fun for losing his cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Drop the smug act already, Diablo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My sincere apologies. I was merely trying to enlighten the ignorant of the greatness of Rimuru-sama&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly why I told you to stay out of it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with such a cringe-inducing dialogue on display in front of everyone, no one could gather the fortitude to crack a joke at it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A little while later, the young girl spoke to Calgurio with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like there&rsquo;s no problem with your memory. I&rsquo;m at ease knowing the spell has worked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-Yes&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay then, allow me to introduce myself properly this time. Nice to meet you all, I am Rimuru, Demon Lord Rimuru, who also happens to be the ruler of this kingdom. I hope we get along!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio froze up as he heard this. Not only him, but everyone else who was revived did the same. When those words were processed in his mind, Calgurio&rsquo;s eyes began to widen to the max upon understanding what she meant. He fixed his eyes on this young girl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was Rimuru. This was the enemy that the Empire had deemed an obstacle necessary to eliminate. And now also one of the Octagram. It was Demon Lord Rimuru in the slime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judging from the situation, she was the one who &nbsp;had resurrected Calgurio and the others. With the demon lord in front of him, that smile was nothing like the drawings which were issued before the march. But the real problem lay elsewhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;E-excuse me, but I wish to confirm something&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmmm? What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; Calgurio stammered, &ldquo;were you the one who resurrected us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wha&mdash;why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a bit difficult to explain, basically I had to transfer the soul&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No no no, that&rsquo;s not the point! I mean why had you decided to resurrect your enemies?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s about that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon being asked by Calgurio, the young maiden&mdash;correction, the Demon Lord Rimuru, nodded, almost as if in relief. He answered rather care-freely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple. Since the war is still on-going, now that you guys have fallen into my hands, you shall now serve as my pawns!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s why I resurrected you lot!&rsquo; he had said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio froze up as if he failed to understand for a while.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demon Lord Rimuru brought people back to life?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who? Them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shock and chaos on top of terror began to creep into his heart. It wasn&rsquo;t just Calgurio, but also all of those who were resurrected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would take some time before peace was restored from the chaos once more.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

This was another premeditated scheme webbed by Raphael-san.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Resurrecting the dead&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ever since the incident with Shion&rsquo;s death, Raphael-san had been analyzing people&rsquo;s souls. So far things had been going well, and we had almost figured out the laws and principles behind it. This applied not only to humans, but monsters, whose souls could be quantified. It was a matter of the pieces called the &ldquo;Information Particle&rdquo;. As long as one could control this, they may in a sense control life and death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Disregarding the quality of animals and plants&rsquo; souls, whose quantities were fairly low, humans, on the other hand, possessed souls that contained immense power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had made sure that everyone here would be given an equal proportion. And depending on whether a person could utilize the energy that was their soul well&mdash;it could lead to the person discovering their soul&rsquo;s power that could be compared to skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The information embedded in one&rsquo;s soul was the source of one&rsquo;s strength. If that was the case, was it possible to directly imbue information to energy&mdash;Well, that was unlikely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, there would be plenty of &ldquo;selfs&rdquo; that existed on different wavelengths, and the combined entity of Information Particles would encapsulate them&mdash;thus forming a core that included all of the information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The crystallization of the energy that encapsulated one&rsquo;s core would be their &ldquo;soul&rdquo;. The Emulated Soul for example, was developed to be used as the container for such a core. The core projected into an Emulated Soul contained no energy, but it possessed &ldquo;selfs&rdquo;. A soul without power could not perform any skills, yet it could act when the &ldquo;self&rdquo; was present.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for this operation to revive Calgurio and his comrades, I used the replacement for souls&mdash;Emulated Souls. By taking their souls and separating them from their cores, I could preserve the bare minimum of energy needed for them to be transferred to Emulated Souls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though I had been unsure about the success rate, it was a relief that it worked in the end. Although, this resurrection was not perfect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Firstly, all of them would be drastically weakened, since their souls&rsquo; power had been taken by me, that was certain. Since I had robbed their souls clean, there was really no point in returning them. I honestly didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d have the right to complain either. As a result, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use their Skills in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if their cores were imbued with information of Skills, they could not use them without the power of their souls. They wouldn&rsquo;t have any chance to learn or use those Skills in the future either. It would also impact their ability to use magic, which they should also work on to improve for future references.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To some extent, if one were to get used to it, they could use magic even with a powerless soul. Magic was both a Skill and an Art, by utilizing the magicule in the air to replace their souls&rsquo; energy, they would be able manipulate principles of magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if they were to use magicules to replace fighting aura, they would even be able to use Arts. If their body weakened, they could retrain them, and with enough practice they&rsquo;d be able to keep any arts they had mastered, as long as the person had not been relying on skills too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, with enough effort they&rsquo;d be strong again. Although the quantity of strength would probably be different, there was probably a threshold to their growth. After all, Emulated Souls were merely toys to make the Labyrinth more entertaining, I hadn&rsquo;t put too much expectation on it anyway. But it should do just fine for this occasion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t revive these Empire soldiers for their well-being, I merely wanted to avoid our reputation from souring. That would determine how the world saw us. It was the Empire who attacked us first, anyway, so getting killed was really just the fruit of their actions. I was in no way obligated to resurrect them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, reviving them was, at the very least, better than damaging our reputation by not doing anything. If there was any value added on top of that, it&rsquo;d probably be for the citizens of the Empire to not bear hatred against us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was really a relief that Raphael-san&rsquo;s experiment was a success. Now that all of them had been revived, we planned to hold the more important figures accountable. Right now, they were also under Souei&rsquo;s watchful eyes. Even though I had revived them, they could only live a &ldquo;fake life&rdquo;. They only had limited degrees of freedom, and we could track them no matter what.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, running away would be impossible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that was that. I was gonna leave these guys as they were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, I planned to finish my own work. Since I had confirmed the effectiveness of the ritual on Calgurio and the others, it seemed to be working fine, so I decided to perform it on a larger scale.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In front of me were around seven-hundred-thousand corpses. Since we wanted to be able to respond quickly to whatever happened later, we had chosen to perform the ritual inside the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Floor 70, which would be Adalmann&rsquo;s territory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We collected as many corpses from the battlefield as possible. Then I suggested to utilize large-scale teleportation to move all of them here. Gobta, Geld, Gabil, and all the floor guardians moved out and recovered the corpses. All of these were corpses of people that could be revived this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The troops deployed in front of Dwargon&rsquo;s Eastern City remained quiet, it seemed that the situation had entered a stalemate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for the 940,000 soldiers that invaded Great Jura Forest, everyone had died in battle except Misha, Lucius, and Raymond. Among them, there were approximately 240,000 corpses that were impossible to retrieve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason for that was because resurrection could not reanimate souls. Only thanks to Testarossa and the rest, could we retrieve &ldquo;souls&rdquo;, and so we needed the remains of their bodies to have a chance at resurrection&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet some of these people had been completely obliterated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For instance, people who had been vaporized by Ultima&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nuclear Flame&rdquo; or those who were completely disintegrated by Testarossa&rsquo;s Death Streak, and those who had been turned into dust by Carrera&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gravity Collapse.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, there were those who could not be revived even without corpse remains. Those who have died of fear and despair. These were the ones who could not be resurrected because their most important ego was gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, Kansas who was killed by Kumara. It seems that his mind was broken by fear at the moment of his death, and there was no Information Particle left in his soul.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Wisdom King Raphael-san couldn&rsquo;t restore the Information Particle itself. So, there was nothing I could do. But I didn&rsquo;t feel it was a problem, since I didn&rsquo;t intend to bring a man like Kansas back to life anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, more than 240,000 people were not revivable&hellip; I guess we can say that we were lucky to have such a small number of people, since they would have all died.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt sorry for those who could not come back to life, but I would just give up on their bad luck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was not an all-powerful god either. I could not create something out of nothing. Besides&hellip; To tell the truth, I had no regrets. I think the three demon girls had gone too far, but this was war. If we cut corners and got ourselves killed, it would be meaningless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only people who mattered to me were my people, and if I had to compare my people with others who had nothing to do with me, I would protect my people without hesitation. And I did not intend to say like a saint that we should be compassionate to the enemy soldiers who invaded our country. With such a flowery mindset, I would be unable to take responsibility for the real damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why I did not care about those who could not come back to life. I didn&rsquo;t have any personal feelings for the people who had died, but I did feel something for them, perhaps because I still had the sensibility of one from Japan, which was a peaceful country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was not regret, and I didn&rsquo;t think what I did is wrong, but it was something I still couldn&rsquo;t get used to. I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking that it would be better if everyone could live happily and peacefully without dying. Still, I would continue to show no mercy to those who invaded my domain, and I would continue to terrorize them thoroughly&hellip; It would be hypocritical of me to pray for their souls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for now, I would say a silent prayer not for the dead, but for those who could come back to life.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;Sacred Birthday&rdquo; was deployed. Calgurio and the others came out of the room, their eyes wide open in astonishment. At this rate, I wonder if their eyes will be able to stay open.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, it was none of my business. Let&rsquo;s just get this over with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I implanted a duplicate Emulated Soul in every corpse. Since this was an emergency, I would make the best use of my &lsquo;duplicates&rsquo;. In this way, I had enough Emulated Souls for each individual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The restoration of the bodies were finished. Thanks to Adalmann and all the other holy magic users, they were all clean now. All of them worked without sleep even though they were working for the enemy soldiers. I was grateful to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalmann, for example, had worked more than others because he did not need to sleep. He must have been more tired than when he was fighting. I decided that I would give him a big &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; for his work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the transplantation of the Emulated Souls to the clean corpses was completed. I was putting it simply, but it went without saying that the work was done by the overwhelming computing power of Wisdom King Raphael.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next, we performed the &ldquo;Secret Art of Anti-Soul Return&rdquo;, which was not the &ldquo;Secret Art of Soul Return&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since this was different from the rebirth of the soul, it did not require much energy. The problem was, rather, that it required a huge amount of calculation to identify each individual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, this was all to be done by Wisdom King Raphael-sensei. I was practically doing nothing. I just stood in silent contemplation and left everything to it. The way it identified individuals in an instant by comparing the genetic information of their bodies with the records of their souls was so brilliant that I had no choice but to call it &lsquo;sensei&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could never have done that. It was a complicated and mysterious technique. But&hellip; Calgurio and the others seemed to think that I was doing everything. At some point, they prostrated themselves and began to make some kind of reverential gesture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wait, I&rsquo;ll feel uncomfortable if you keep doing that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was too much of a misunderstanding, and I wanted them to stop it. I couldn&rsquo;t complain until the surgery was finished, even though I wanted to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, for a day and a night, I continued to use the secret technique in this uncomfortable situation. The resuscitation of about 700,000 imperial generals was successfully completed.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.24px; height: 30.24px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Everyone was silently concentrating on their meals, as if tasting the feeling of being alive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A variety of vegetables and meats were stewed in a large pot, a food with a unique taste like a stew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was warm and filling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soup was indescribably moving to the Imperial Army soldiers who were slowly becoming aware of the reality now that the chaos was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio was one of those defeated soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unaware of his hunger, he felt the tension in the air being lifted. As he realized this, he slowly realized over and over again that they had died once before, killed by Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they were all still alive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The demon lord had said it was a &ldquo;false life&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. There are no inconveniences if one is living a normal life You could fall in love, have a family, have children. But there is a limit on the actions that would be detrimental to us! The curse I have engraved in your Pseudo Soul makes it impossible for you to ever act hostile to us again. I hope you can understand that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Once the chaos was over, he had told them this in front of everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Calgurio was convinced that there is no need for such a &ldquo;curse&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who would ever dare to repeat such a folly twice?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Veldora had struck hundreds of years ago, only horror could be felt as a result. But even so, it is not impossible to produce a comparable disaster by human hands, even if a city disappears and all its inhabitants disappear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was that why?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fear was felt, but no one truly believed him to be invincible. Or rather, if there had been more survivors, the fundamental fear might have been conveyed and the inviolability might have been asserted more, but that would have been the limit after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this time, however, there was no way to make such a mistake. They died, and then were resurrected&hellip; All by the hand of not a god, but a demon lord. How could anyone think of defying him when he showed them such a ridiculous miracle?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We&mdash;I was too stupid&hellip; I understand that I was too arrogant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, was this really the work of a demon lord in the first place?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Calgurio couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Overnight, Krishna and others seemed to have made Demon Lord Rimuru the object of their faith. He was now following him with his eyes as if he were still worshiping him. Well, it was Calgurio who started worshiping the demon lord first, so he couldn&rsquo;t and wouldn&rsquo;t complain&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The demon lord had said &ldquo;false life&rdquo;, but there was actually no problem with this either. Indeed, the ability to fight was gone. But it wasn&rsquo;t so much that it was hard to live. Even Calgurio and the others could still defeat a certain number of monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To Demon Lord Rimuru, they may have been insignificant, but to Calgurio&rsquo;s group, some of them still had the strength close to A rank. They could not use their Skills, and they had difficulty in using magic, but they still had a well-trained body. And they were allowed to live until their bodies aged and they reached the end of their biological life span. That was enough, Calgurio thought. And this was the same feeling shared by all of the approximately 700,000 soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one would dare to rebel against Demon Lord Rimuru when they were all so grateful and in awe. They were defeated from the bottom of their hearts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone wanted the war to be over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The imperial invasion could only be described as a complete failure.</span><a id="id.17dp8vu"></a></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c8 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px;"><img alt="" src="images/image27.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1127.07px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c8 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.3rdcrjn"><span class="c5 c22">Afterword</span></h2><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Long time no see, everyone.

It says, &ldquo;The horrific massacre by Tempest&rsquo;s overwhelming military might,&rdquo; but what does that exactly mean? Shouldn&rsquo;t the synopsis be more about the protagonist&rsquo;s crisis? That&rsquo;s when I subvert expectations, so it&rsquo;ll give more of an &ldquo;MC is so cool!&rdquo; vibe, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But still, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;massacre.&rdquo; With this, it&rsquo;s no longer about being in a tough situation or anything like that, but more mowing down the enem&mdash;uh, please wait a moment. By some chance, will the MC only face crises from now on with this kind of reverse thinking?! As the creator, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case, but please see for yourself what the truth really is!</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.68px; height: 22.68px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light
