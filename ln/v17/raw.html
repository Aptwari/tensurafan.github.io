At that point in time, he was a hero in my eyes, but I was astonished to hear that he had become one of the Octagram shortly thereafter.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And that&rsquo;s not all.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He is also a friend of the Demon Lord Milim-sama, from the legends, as well as the True Dragon Veldora-sama, of which there are only four in the world! At this point, I&rsquo;m tired of being surprised.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m so tired of being surprised that I can&rsquo;t help but go &ldquo;hmm&rdquo; at anything I hear these days.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For that reason, I will stop talking about Rimuru-sama and get to the point.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My ambition has always been to become a great merchant who is not to be taken for a fool by anyone.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I was able to open a shop in the small country of Blumund and a branch in the large country of Ingracia.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Just as I was starting to get my face on the map and business was starting to take off, Fuze-dono, the Blumund Kingdom&rsquo;s Guildmaster, asked me to join him, which was how I met Rimuru-sama.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rimuru-sama, who had become a Demon Lord, came to me and asked me to work for him as an executive.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My current position is that of Minister of Finance.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The name may change from time to time, but the job is the same. My job is to transfer the vast amount of wealth gathered in the Demon Lord Kingdom to the departments I deem necessary.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When I was a merchant, a portion of the sales of various businesses was my reward. I had to work hard to raise the working capital from the leftover money, after deducting the cost of purchases and labor costs. But now, however, it&rsquo;s a different kind of hard work.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The amount of money we are dealing with nowadays is on a different order of magnitude.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the old days, my salary was nothing more than a well of water in front of the ocean.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And as for my current salary&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Fifty gold coins a month. Naturally, this is the amount of money after taxes are deducted.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Apart from bonuses and other allowances, this is a housing allowance.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And that&rsquo;s not all.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The trainees act as housekeepers for free, so it&rsquo;s just like having the monster kingdom taking care of the house.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s an unbeatable deal, and I&rsquo;m very happy.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Of course, I also take care of the people who followed me from Blumund, but most of them work for me and are paid by the government. The only people directly employed by the government are the family members and Bydd, who are entrusted with the housekeeping, and they are paid about twenty gold coins at the most.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But here&rsquo;s what is surprising me.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In addition to my salary, I have several other revenues.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One is the profit that my company makes.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Starting with a fast food restaurant at the Founding Festival, Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s idea took shape in the Blumund Kingdom and a rest stop on the road, and I am the owner of each of these restaurants. I am paid by the government, but for some reason I am also paid personally.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">According to Rimuru-sama, he and I are destined to be together.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rimuru-sama said, &ldquo;Myourmiles-kun. When you make money, I will be rich too&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t that right? Since the money was earned by giving shape to our ideas, shouldn&rsquo;t that be a fair price to pay?</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So, he trusts me completely.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t know this, but according to Rimuru-sama, he and I had a contract to split the profits. He has not put it in writing, but Rimuru-sama is determined to honor the agreement.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That is why I&rsquo;m doing my best to meet Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s expectations.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As a result, I am receiving hundreds of gold coins every month from each store. In addition, the profits are decreasing because of the investment in the first period, but it is expected to continue to increase in the future.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The existing branches are expanding. We&rsquo;ve received requests from all over the world to open more branches, so that&rsquo;s something we need to consider.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And the variety of shops is likely to increase as well. There are many more restaurants that Rimuru-sama asks Gobichi-dono to serve. There is also the added benefit of being the first to taste good food, so I&rsquo;m more than happy to take a stake in the company.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Burger shops and Ramen shops are doing very well. Teppan-yaki shops have also become a major player, and an ice cream store is in the works.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is even an inn on the main road that is offering new dishes.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Depending on how popular they are, I&rsquo;m sure there will be even more of them.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For that reason, I think it&rsquo;s as good as guaranteed that we will continue to make enough profit to match our investments.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If this happens, rather than having fun, I&rsquo;m afraid of how much my income is going to increase.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Frankly speaking, in less than a year, I&rsquo;ve accumulated enough money to live in luxury for the rest of my life.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s truly an unbeatable deal, but this isn&rsquo;t the end of the story.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is yet another source of income for me.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s the Three Drunk Sages.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">The &ldquo;Three Drunk Sages&rdquo; is a reference to Rimuru-sama, the Celestial Emperor Elmesia of the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Dynasty Sarion, and me, &ldquo;Gard Myourmiles.&rdquo; It is an acronym of these three names, and refers to a naming organization.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t care about myself, but Her Majesty Elmesia is a heavenly person.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is said that even for the nobility of a great country, there is usually a waiting list of several years for an audience with her.

I thought that Rimuru-sama was a very scary person to be casually drinking with such a person as her.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I cannot remember now why I was drinking with him, either. But thanks to that, even I can now call Her Majesty Elmesia as an older sister.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why some people call us the Three Drunk Sages, but it&rsquo;s not known that we three are involved in the Three Drunk Sages.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is a top-secret matter, and only a few people know about it.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the Monster Kingdom, only Benimaru-dono and Souei-dono are known to be involved in this matter.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Souei-dono has helped me by lending his subordinates, so I can&rsquo;t keep it a secret from him.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As for Benimaru-dono, Rimuru-sama called out to him&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You will get married one day, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well in preparation for that time, you need to hide this from your wife and save up some pocket money, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, my salary is enough&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You idiot! If you don&rsquo;t at least keep your annual income stashed away, it&rsquo;s going to be hard to go out drinking with your male friends!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that so!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s what a man&rsquo;s worth is all about!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I remember him having a conversation like that.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It may seem slightly wrong, but it&rsquo;s not something I would interfere with. I wisely ignored it and avoided getting involved.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Besides, the annual income of Benimaru-dono, the Minister of War, is the same as mine. And with six hundred gold coins, I don&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s any drink he can&rsquo;t afford.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Well, that&rsquo;s not important.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For some reason, Rimuru-sama is afraid that Shuna-sama will find out about his plan.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The reason Rimuru-sama invited Benimaru-dono is because he wants Shuna-sama&rsquo;s older brother to keep an eye on her, and to get her to agree with him.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Anyway, I got Benimaru-dono as a collaborator, and borrowed some of Souei-dono&rsquo;s subordinates. The Three Drunk Sages&rsquo; secret society plan has been set in motion with them as the executing unit.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s point of view is very interesting.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The crux of the plan is the transformation of the relationship between the three drunk sages.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The plan was to gain complete control of the Three Drunk Sages, the secret society that serves as a device of violence, and to encourage clean conflict on the surface.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you only create one giant organization, it will eventually rot from within. It was decided to set up two organizations in the first place because we knew there would be people who would have a grudge against the Jura Tempest Federation.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">By making them compete with each other, we hope to revitalize our business. In addition, by making them compete with each other, the two organizations would be encouraged to cooperate with one another.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In this way, we are trying to prevent the organization from becoming corrupt.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When the organization was founded, I was impressed because I would never have been able to think that far into the future.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My role was to unite the two organizations.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Older Sister is the one in charge of uniting the survivors of the Rosso clan with King Dolan of the Dolan General Kingdom at the center. Then, the &ldquo;Western General Trading Company&rdquo; was established by those who have enmity against our monster country.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In order to counter this, it was necessary for me to establish the &ldquo;Four Nations Trade Federation&rdquo; at the earliest opportunity.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As planned, we set up an umbrella organization involving the leading figures of the Blumund Kingdom, the Farmenas Kingdom and the Dwarven Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The merchants I took in after the Founding Festival became my hands and feet.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The number of business partners has decreased drastically, and they are on the verge of being ostracized by their homeland and abandoned by their families. So when the time was right, I reached out and offered my help.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I offered them a living if they would work for me, and few would be so foolish as to refuse that offer.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Of course, there were still a few who did.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Because this was reported in newspapers world-wide, their names have been sold in a bad way. Few people would trust such a person and hire them, so it was obvious that this was the last helping hand they would get.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The reporters did a great job too. Needless to say, it was terrifying how Rimuru-sama and Diablo-dono guided it.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thanks to that, my work went well. I owe it to them for making it so interesting.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Of course, some of them would be aware of our intentions, and more than a few of them were, but doing anything about it would be useless. Also, they have no reason to complain about the payment, since we are not lying about it.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was their pride that was the problem, but that was about it. A merchant is a cash cow, and most things are acceptable if it makes a profit.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Demonstrating competence would increase their position and salary. Their complaints gradually disappeared, and they pledged their loyalty to me.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I even got the former head of the store, Bach, involved.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He had become a respectable manager while paying off his debts to me, and I left him with the job on the condition that he would pay off the rest of his debts.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He felt that he owed me a debt of gratitude, so he did a lot more than I expected.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There were other excellent human resources growing up.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When the King of Blumund heard from Fuze-dono, he gathered all his trusted advisors. He said that they were promoting human resource development in preparation for the coming day.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Dwarven Kingdom had also dispatched some excellent civil servants.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The dwarves have a long life expectancy, so there is no way for them to rise through the ranks unless their superiors retire. And so, some quick-witted people who have taken advantage of this opportunity have come forward to offer themselves to me as well.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s good to be ambitious.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I heard that the Western General Trading Company, organized by older sister (Elmesia), has also signed up the elves, and with the participation of dwarf civil servants, there was no better rival than the Western General Trading Company.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However,</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Farmenas Kingdom, on the other hand, needed help to open a branch office, and the Freedom Association was willing to help, but the stability of the country was still the priority.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is to be expected, so we are taking a long-term view and have given our support to the people who will grow up to be able to do so.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But now comes the hard part.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We didn&rsquo;t have enough staff to expand into Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As I watched the Three Drunk Sages expand, I envied the Three Drunk Sages from the bottom of my heart, as they continued to crush and absorb the underworld.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The underworld was fine, but an organization that was active in the public arena needed good people who could be trusted with the job. The people we scouted were sent to the Monster Country to be trained, but it would still take a few years for the buds to sprout.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">By principle, it is out of the question, from my point of view, to entrust such an important job to a stranger.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When it comes to that, it is necessary to be very selective about the people we hire. And as I feared, we have been short of people to hire due to sending personnel to various countries.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thus, I turned to Rimuru-sama for advice.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m in a bind. Our country&rsquo;s human resources are monsters, so I am reluctant to send them out into human society.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. There are many excellent people, and I think they will be accepted once they start working together, but I wonder if it is still too early to do so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I agree with you, Myourmiles-kun. If the person who looks down on you is too good, one will be jealous of them and vice-versa. It would be worse if they were persecuted or something, and I feel it&rsquo;s not good to think about things in a hurry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rimuru-sama and I agreed.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then what should we do?</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Just as we were pondering, Rimuru-sama came up with a solution.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped. She seems to be very capable, and I&rsquo;d like to ask her to cooperate in this matter as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After saying this, he called up his direct subordinate, Testarossa-dono.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Testarossa-dono was a diplomat and was reputed to be a very talented person. I was introduced to her, but she was so beautiful that I was too nervous to have a proper conversation with her.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, you wanted to see me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A smile, full of grace, and a look of extraordinary beauty.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The scent in the air was so overwhelming that I couldn&rsquo;t help but be overwhelmed by it.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">While I was stunned, a conversation between Rimuru-sama and Testarossa-dono was occurring beside me.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To tell you the truth, we&rsquo;re short on people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see, if that&rsquo;s the case, please leave it to me. I&rsquo;ll have my subordinates work with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, yeah? Yes, that&rsquo;d a big help. Also, this is a secret mission, so make sure to keep it a secret.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh my, it&rsquo;s a secret between me and Rimuru-sama. I promise I won&rsquo;t tell anyone. And of course, my subordinates as well. If they ever speak of this&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Testarossa-dono laughed.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Seeing that smile, Rimuru-sama and I felt very confident that our secret would be kept strictly to the letter.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thus, it was very easy to come to an agreement.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then Testarossa-dono looked at me and smiled.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have strict orders that I am to be absolutely obedient to you, Gard-sama&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When her voice reached my brain, I felt as if I were going to heaven.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gard-sama,&rdquo;&mdash;that Testarossa-dono called me by my name.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you very much!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I couldn&rsquo;t help but answer with a gluttonous smile.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And so, with the help of Testarossa-dono, the plan began to take off almost scarily well.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In just a few months, a branch of the &ldquo;Four Nations Trade Federation&rdquo; has been set up in every member country of the Council. It is small, enough to accommodate about ten staff members, but it should be enough for the time being.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This was a surprise to me, but an even more surprising event still awaited me.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I was elected as the representative of the Four Nations Trade Federation.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Myourmiles-dono, whom Rimuru trusts, can trust me too. I&rsquo;ll leave everything to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When Gazel, the king, gave me encouragement, I was so nervous that I felt paralyzed.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As long as the king had said that, the dwarven officials had no objections. They may have been dissatisfied, but on the surface, they obediently followed.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because we are on the side of being helped, I don&rsquo;t have any complaints at the moment. So, good luck with that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And Youm-dono.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then I overheard him saying, &ldquo;It must be hard for you to be pushed around by that guy, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; but I smiled and replied, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true for both of us. Thanks to you, I&rsquo;ve been able to live a very pleasant life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Youm-dono laughed as well, so I think the feeling was mutual.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The King of Blumund was troublesome.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At first glance, he seemed to be a friendly man, but my gut feeling told me something else.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Drum Blumund&mdash;this man can&rsquo;t be trusted.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And sure enough, negotiations with the King of Blumund were not going to be easy.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ho-ho-ho, you are the representative of the federation, so &nbsp;you will have unimaginable power in the future. If Myourmiles-dono is going to take over the reins, I&rsquo;ll be at ease too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Is it that bad? I wondered, but it could be, depending on how things unfolded.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ha-ha, I&rsquo;m honored. Well, I&rsquo;ll see you in the future&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By the way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Here it comes! I braced myself.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In my country, we are in the process of training our staff for Rimuru-dono&rsquo;s project. We would, naturally, want to expect job security.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, of course. In fact, the plan won&rsquo;t be able to move forward without the cooperation of those people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I am relieved to hear that. Then, of course, you are aware of the situation in our country, are you not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The situation, sir?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t know what he was talking about, so I didn&rsquo;t bother to answer the question.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then the King of Blumund, with a friendly smile, said something that made me want to scream at him like an idiot.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let me put it simply. We have abolished all agriculture in our country. We are now selling off all the food stored in the national treasury to keep the people in line. We need your support.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I couldn&rsquo;t help but exclaim, but I think it couldn&rsquo;t be helped.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mmm, of course I&rsquo;ll do everything I can, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m the only one&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure Rimuru-dono will smile and give us permission. He has built the &lsquo;World Station&rsquo; of the Magic Train in our country, and I am sure that you will not abandon us for responding to your spirit. &ldquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s unreasonable!</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I want to scream at him for his absurd logic, but somewhere in my heart I am convinced.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This man had staked the fate of the nation on Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s plan.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Would this be considered an incredible act of stupidity or a wise decision? No, no&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I must prove that he made the right decision.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Because if this is seen as a fool&rsquo;s errand, it would mean that Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s plan has failed.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We have no manpower to begin with, and it would be a great help to us if all the people of the Blumund Kingdom were to work for us.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Therefore, I had only one answer.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. King of Blumund, I swear to you that I will take responsibility for hiring all of Blumund&rsquo;s people. Of course, you will leave the food aid to me as an advance on my salary!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ho-ho-ho, Myourmiles-dono is reliable! I would like to be able to continue relying and helping you with various things in the future as well. Therefore, please call me &ldquo;Drum&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Well, what a surprise.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A mere merchant like me is allowed to call him by his name?</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid not&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It could be a trap, so I refused it for the time being&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Myourmiles&mdash;no, I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and call you Gard-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, no, no, I&rsquo;m just a former commoner who was taken in by Rimuru-sama&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ho-ho-ho, no need for modesty. Nobody would think of Gard-dono, who is a friend of not only Rimuru-dono, but also Her Majesty Elmesia, as a mere commoner.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Even I can&rsquo;t call her by her name,&rdquo; King Blumund said with a straight face.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although he is acquainted with Rimuru-sama and knows him well enough to be on friendly terms, the expression on his face tells me that to Her Majesty the Emperor of Sarion, a superpower, he&rsquo;s nothing more than an insignificant member of the royal family.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no denying it.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I have turned my back on this fact, but I have to admit that older sister is an extraordinary person.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If so, I assume that this is the reason that the King of Blumund wants to have a close relationship with me.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s an honor to call him by name, and it&rsquo;s also a great way to build a good relationship.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But what to do&hellip;well, don&rsquo;t bother.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Come to think of it, it&rsquo;s not the name of the country over there. Prince Figaro is the representative of the country, so it&rsquo;s okay.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then, with His Majesty Drum&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, wait, let&rsquo;s be on equal footing here. Even with Drum-chan&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, that&rsquo;s not right! I mean, it&rsquo;s absurd!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, it is! I understand. Well, then may I call you Drum-dono from now on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I was afraid to change the name, since it was the person himself who had asked me to do so. I didn&rsquo;t want to be arrested for being rude, though I didn&rsquo;t believe that was likely.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As a result, Drum-dono laughed happily at me.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that. Being friends with Gard-dono, I feel as if I have become a great person,&rdquo; said Drum-dono. &ldquo;I look forward to working with you as a friend in the future!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Before I knew it, I had become friends with Drum-dono.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t know if I was allowed to do that, and I asked for help from others to see if they would disagree.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Behind Drum-dono stood a group of stern-looking ministers, but no one complained. On the contrary, everyone was smiling happily, as if they were relieved.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I had no choice but to realize that the Blumund Kingdom was serious.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They had invested everything they had in the Four Nations Trade Federation, a supranational organization represented by me, and they were betting their country&rsquo;s survival by joining forces with it.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s an unbelievable gamble.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not easy for me to make a decision like this. In that sense, this Drum Blumund is undoubtedly an impressive man.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wish to build a good relationship with you for a long time. Please guide me as a friend, so that I do not become a &lsquo;fox that borrows the power of the tiger.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I replied to Drum-dono with sincere respect.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After the meeting with the King&rsquo;s Drum-dono, we had a practical meeting.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Veryard-dono, who had risen up to the rank of Viscount, gave us a report on the current situation.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He told me that they have enough food to last for one year, and that their education is going well. Those with high ability have been dispersed throughout the country as an immediate asset.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, in our country, we have always been very good at underworld espionage activities. Those people have gone to various countries to conduct price surveys and so on. We are working hard to train our administrative staff under the slogan &lsquo;Rich country, wise people.&rsquo; Adults and children alike are working together to learn about world affairs and economics.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t doubt Drum-dono&rsquo;s words, but I didn&rsquo;t expect him to be as thorough as he was.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If a king is a king, then his subjects are his subjects too.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oops, I can&rsquo;t help but be surprised.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I understand. Then I will report on the progress of our plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I, too, should stop hiding things.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After that, I spoke about the current situation without hiding anything.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The development of the Magic Train is going well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The construction of the rails is underway from the end point at Dwargon via the intermediate Farmenas, to Blumund in the middle of the line.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The ingredients produced at Farmenas is transported to Dwargon, where the cargo &nbsp;is replaced with industrial products. Then they unload at Farmenas and send the rest to Blumund.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Eventually Blumund will have to act as a collection point.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. So, food hygiene will be an important part of the job in the future?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, sir. Also, we would like Blumund to consider where to sell the necessary supplies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ve explained that to the officials we sent to you as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mmmm, I heard you are Fuze-dono&rsquo;s best friend, but Veryard-dono is no exception.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Come to think of it, Rimuru-sama also told me that Veryard-dono is a shrewd man, so we can&rsquo;t be too careful. I see, this is indeed an opponent with whom we can&rsquo;t let our guard down.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good point. Then what do you intend to do about the abandoned land?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made plans on that as well. Here in the vicinity of the royal capital, we have secured a site for the World Station. From there, we will set up a vacant lot in all directions to connect to the city road.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve prepared some land on the outskirts of Royal Capital. We plan to connect it with the World Station and make it a logistics base.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My God&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We were so well prepared, it was astonishing.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">From here, the negotiations began in earnest, without any bellyaching.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Our monster kingdom will provide the labor force. We will build a huge &lsquo;World Station&rsquo; and open a line to Dwargon.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This will be followed by the opening of new routes to Sarion and Ingracia.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At the same time, it was decided to build warehouses on the vacant land that had been prepared. This will allow Blumund to grow into a major commercial area in the future. With land prices likely to rise, it&rsquo;s imperative to secure a prime location before it&rsquo;s too late.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This place, the Blumund Kingdom, will be a logistics base in the future. I had planned to buy the best location for the site, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then, it&rsquo;s a branch of the &ldquo;Four Nations Trade Federation,&rdquo; but because the current location is temporary, I would like to build a new one.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ve secured a special area for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had a bad feeling about that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tried to decipher Veryard-dono&rsquo;s expression, but the smug smile on his face kept me from doing so.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Does that mean you&rsquo;ll have to give it away?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The land needed for stations and rails is treated as compensation for technology and labor, as well as joint expenses in the future, so there&rsquo;s no problem since we&rsquo;ve discussed that it would be free. Therefore, I have put off the purchase of the branch&rsquo;s land until later, but the situation is getting worse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My fears have been proven true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, please don&rsquo;t do that. In the Blumund Kingdom, we have decreed that all land is the property of the state. And we have transitioned to a new form of government-loaned lands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They got me!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even I never would have guessed that they would pull off such a feat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m impressed that they&rsquo;ve passed such a bill. I wonder how they managed to convince the aristocrats who have vested interests in it?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are the rents in that area&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;On a per square meter basis, we plan to pay one silver dollar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not expensive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not cheap, but if you wanted to rent land in the capital of Ingracia, you&rsquo;d need three silver coins per square meter. So it&rsquo;s better to buy, even if you have to pay income tax every year.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there is a bigger problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problem is that the other party can take control before the profit or loss!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru-sama is surprisingly unconcerned, but this is the kind of thing that makes things hard to deal with.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What will you do if they change the terms and conditions in the middle?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as we&rsquo;re on friendly terms with them, it&rsquo;s fine, but people are replaceable, so it&rsquo;s important to secure permanent rights.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t think this would happen, but what if they raised the rent?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it is within the range of common sense, we can accept their request on a case-by-case basis. However, if they raise the rent unreasonably, one can&rsquo;t deny the possibility of quarrel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I understand that this is just a contingency, but older sister has told me to think about that eventuality.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we owned the land, the unreasonable demands would be grounded. But if the other party has the right to the land, it will be a problem if conditions are not met.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you complain, the owner has the right to question you. If you don&rsquo;t like it, you have no choice but to leave.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I want to make sure we get possession. If that&rsquo;s not possible, then it&rsquo;s hard to over-invest in this place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, just as I was wondering what to do, Veryard-dono grinned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rents will fluctuate according to the economy, but here&rsquo;s an interesting story only for Myourmiles-dono!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This guy really can&rsquo;t stop.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have a bad feeling, but I&rsquo;m afraid I mustn&rsquo;t stop listening.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the story?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple. We in the Blumund Kingdom would like to offer you a settlement concession as a token of our friendship.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Concession, you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s about the special area mentioned earlier, and that we&rsquo;re willing to grant extraterritoriality to the special area by entering into a perpetual land lease that will be in effect permanently.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My God!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was surprised, but it was too good to be true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that Veryard-dono is going to explain it to me before I even have time to ponder what kind of a backstory there is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no backstory. It was His Majesty Drum&rsquo;s idea. I was against it, but the other ministers voted for it and it was adopted. There are equal advantages and disadvantages to this idea. The disadvantage, of course, is that we will be hit by other countries if we sell off our land.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I guess so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was surprised that they didn&rsquo;t try to hide it, but when I heard it was Drum-dono&rsquo;s idea, it made sense. And I think I see the merits of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The advantage is, of course, that we can expect your country to invest in us to the fullest. Also, we have decided that our country can gain an advantage by adding various conditions to the permanent land lease contract.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The question is what kind of conditions will be added.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? It&rsquo;s simple. One, that you employ our citizens as your employees. The other is that I want you to establish a headquarters for the Four Nations Trade Federation in our country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see, I thought to myself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If the headquarters of the Four Nations Trade Federation is in the Blumund Kingdom, it will not only become a logistics center, but also a center of the world economy. Replacing the current position of the Ingracia Kingdom would not be an impossiblity, and the value of the Blumund Kingdom will skyrocket.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Land prices will rise, of course, and the real estate income alone will be very lucrative if the representatives of each country have embassies there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike tourist destinations, this one is not affected by the economy. Moreover, it promises jobs for the people of Blumund.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you have the will to join and work together with the Four Nations Trade Federation, it becomes a gamble with a great return. I was convinced from the bottom of my heart that this is just like Drum-dono, a genuine gambler.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it was also in Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s vision that the Blumund Kingdom would be the center of the world economy. I had no reason to oppose it, so I nodded my head and agreed to it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that, we had a detailed discussion with Veryard-dono and signed a contract.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The contract is basically to protect each other&rsquo;s rights and interests. For example, all contracts will be cancelled in the event of a war.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought it was satisfactory, but I wanted to hear what Veryard-dono really thought, for future reference.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I would like to ask you one thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, Veryard-dono was against the deal, or so I&rsquo;m told. I&rsquo;d like to know what you think about the result.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because the content is such that we gave preferential treatment to the &quot;Four Nations Trade Federation,&quot; miscellaneous matters such as explanations to other countries will increase. I was wondering if he wasn&rsquo;t amused, if not displeased.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Veryard-dono looked thoughtful. He got up without looking at me, and then, while I was wondering what was on his mind, walked to the window and looked out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veryard-dono clears his throat in front of me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking to myself, so please pay me no mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After refusing that, he opened his mouth seriously.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A nobleman is a creature who never shows his true feelings. You must not. If the negotiations turn out to be unfavorable, they will say that things went as planned. Otherwise, you will show your opponent weakness. I said, &lsquo;I was against it.&rsquo; That is, I want you to understand that I was for it at the time of the negotiations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was surprised that that was the real intention.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If so, it was exactly what Veryard-dono was aiming for.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve lost, but I&rsquo;ve learned once again how hard it is to negotiate with the nobility.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t help but grumble about it too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh dear&hellip;I still have a long way to go. I thought I was good at dealing with noblemen, too. But I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m going to be able to represent the Four Nations Trade Federation if this continues.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, Myourmiles-dono is a tough guy, even from my point of view. Excuse me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ha-ha, I&rsquo;ll take that as a compliment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked at Veryard-dono with a wry smile. Unexpectedly, Veryard-dono laughed too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His usual cool expression belied the humanity in his face.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t be offended, but would you be interested in working for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, he&rsquo;d definitely say no. But there was still a hint of truth in my questioning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was confident that having a man of Veryard-dono&rsquo;s caliber working for me would give us the best possible advantage as we expand our operations in the Ingracia Kingdom, which would be plaguing us in the near future.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ha-ha, it&rsquo;s not my place to say anything. If you can pass this off as a joke&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s an interesting suggestion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked intently at Veryard-dono&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s very serious, not a joke in sight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m actually thinking about changing my job, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After saying this, Veryard-dono told me about the current situation and future prospects for the Blumund Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rich and wise are a double-edged sword. The future of the people is secure, but the status of the nobility will be shaken in the future.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We have no land-owning aristocrats in Blumund. Nor are there many of them. Maybe one percent of the city&rsquo;s million people. There are less than 2,000 knights, and their families number 8,000 or so, so there are less than a hundred people involved in politics. That&rsquo;s all well and good for now, but in the near future, everyone will be in an honorary position. That&rsquo;s the direction His Majesty Drum has set.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, it was a small country that was able to achieve this drastic reformation by protecting the interests of the nobility. There may have been opposition, but as a result, they&rsquo;ve continued to this day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because Veryard-dono was not, you know, opposed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s more a matter of profit. I just thought I&rsquo;d have to find another job before I became unemployed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a grin, Veryard-dono said that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I saw that smile, and I knew.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve been beaten.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s one for you. Did you pretend to answer my question and then sell yourself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh, I was hoping you&rsquo;d figure that out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see. If I hadn&rsquo;t figured it out, I wouldn&rsquo;t have passed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then, really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;d like Myourmiles-sama to hire me. However, is it okay to treat me as a consultant for the time being?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I understand his position as a nobleman. He won&rsquo;t be able to move much for a while. But I&rsquo;m counting on Veryard-dono&rsquo;s intellect and experience, so there&rsquo;s no harm in being a consultant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course! I look forward to working with you in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veryard-dono and I shook hands with each other, laughing inivincibly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Veryard-dono as my advisor, the Four Nations Trade Federation began to grow steadily.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">And now the time has come for us to face our worst enemies in business</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">the big merchants.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you going to be in Ingracia Kingdom today, Gard-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The one who asked was Bydd, who was in charge of the escort. We have gotten to know each other well and have allowed each other to call us by our names.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Forged in monster country, Bydd&rsquo;s current strength has risen from a D+ rank to a B rank. Now that he&rsquo;s renewed hiis armor, he&rsquo;s become reasonably reliable and I always ask him to accompany me when I go out on excursions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, Gobemon-dono was there too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">This one is even more impressive and looks like a warrior of the past. His strength is now over Rank A and it seems he&rsquo;s evolved into a Kijin (fair oni race)</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I heard that they are of legendary status&hellip;but they&rsquo;re common in the monster kingdom. I think I&rsquo;ll only lose if I look into everything, so I&rsquo;m just going to let it slide.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I have an important meeting today, and I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to have to go somewhere dangerous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh? I guess it&rsquo;s my turn, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you talking about, brother Gobemon! You don&rsquo;t have a chance with me here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh, I&rsquo;m not so sure about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobemon-dono is laughing at the confident Bydd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobemon-dono became a Kijin, but his skin color remained the same. I guess that&rsquo;s the difference between individuals.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s grown horns too, but they&rsquo;re small so he hides them with a bandana or hat. He was wearing a hat that matched his suit and looked stylish.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He still seems like a hobgoblin at first glance, so it&rsquo;s easy to catch any opponents off guard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bydd is stronger now, but he&rsquo;s still unreliable. Gobemon-dono has always helped me as my bodyguard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m leaving it up to them to protect me, but today I&rsquo;m afraid it might not be enough. After all, the merchants who control the Western Nations are the ones we are meeting today.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I needn&rsquo;t worry about that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, Rimuru-sama knows what we have planned for today. Whether the negotiations go well or not, my safety is assured.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So for now, I want to enjoy this comfortable tension.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In response to my call, the big names of the world have gathered in one place&mdash;this is a man&rsquo;s romance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To straighten up after a long absence, the three of us have decided to wear dark suits today.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now, are you ready?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I asked, and Bydd and Gobemon-dono nodded emphatically.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I steeled myself and headed to the hotel where we were to meet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The automatic door opened.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, may I ask your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a refined motion, the hotel clerk inquired.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Myourmiles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&#9472;&#9472;! Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry. May I see your ID, just in case?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one else is going to steal my name, but I have to cooperate. It means that we&rsquo;re thorough with everyone else, so it&rsquo;s rather safe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is this okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bydd took a letter of introduction from his pocket and showed it to the hotel man. After looking at it, we were searched to make sure we weren&rsquo;t carrying any weapons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, my subordinates came running in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Myourmiles-sama, we&rsquo;ve been expecting you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Everything is set up right away. The venue is here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My men, who sent the hotelier away, lead me to the ballroom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The venue this time is where the aristocrats hold balls and other events.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were already many people milling about, and all eyes were on me as I entered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the representative of the Four Nations Trade Federation, the organizer of this event?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, he looks familiar. He was a very smart businessman, if I remember correctly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That man, I hear that he has taken over Demon Lord Rimuru and taken his current position?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But don&rsquo;t underestimate him. I hear that the trade in monster country was arranged by that man. Rumor has it he gained some leverage over a beleaguered retail community.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmph, it&rsquo;s a nouveau riche after all. The Rosso family&rsquo;s influence is now a thing of the past, and although there seems to be a move to rewind in the Dolan General Kingdom, the other Five Great Elders show no signs of being replaced. It&rsquo;s probably over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Johann Duke of Rosteia was also arrested by an Ingracia Magical Inquisitor. He won&rsquo;t be able to recover.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have heard that the Border Count Sidel has been captured as well. He was charged with the defense of Ingracia, and now he&rsquo;s abandoned it. I doubt he&rsquo;ll ever see the light of day again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In other words, whoever takes the lead at today&rsquo;s meeting will be promised the power of the next generation,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fufufu, I won&rsquo;t let a newcomer like that take that place. I&rsquo;m not calling for a bunch of rednecks like Four Nations Trade Federation!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But the monster kingdom is tricky.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right. Their military might is not to be underestimated, and I hear that a woman named Testarossa or something like that has even taken control of the council.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see what he can do, shall we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Master Left. If that man has no ability, it would be best for us to take his place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure Demon Lord Rimuru will also give preference to those who are more competent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so on and so forth, the flowers of rumor are blooming madly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone seems to be curious about me. The conversation is so obvious that I can hear it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, that&rsquo;s understandable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Today, not only the old Rosso faction, but also some of the biggest names in the world&rsquo;s underworld are gathered here. These are men who control the wealth of the world and who usually don&rsquo;t ever meet each other.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are the tycoons of the old days, whom I would have once had difficulty meeting. One only has to look at the rumors of the Five Great Elders to see the breadth of their connections.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who live as if they were living horses. That desire is endless, and instead of being frightened by the fall of Rosso, they are enthusiastic about the opportunity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t let my guard down. I brace myself even more.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, someone calls out to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, Myourmiles. You&rsquo;re getting pretty big, aren&rsquo;t you? Why don&rsquo;t you say hello to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, that&rsquo;s Don Gabbana&rsquo;s bodyguard, Arlecio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A big, muscular, middle-aged man. He wears full-body black leather armor, which is unbecoming, but no one blames him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s just as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aftere all, Arlecio is a retired former A-rank adventurer, and the incarnation of so much violence that there isn&rsquo;t anyone in the underworld who hasn&rsquo;t heard his name.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, I knew him as well. Not that I wanted to see him though.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio is a ferocious beast of a man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Always hungry, and always ready to hunt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ever since I met him as a young man, he&rsquo;s always asked me for food and pocket money. I&rsquo;d complain, but this man was the incarnation of violence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And worst of all, Don Gabbana is standing behind him. He is a nobleman without a title but of such stature that even Ingracia&rsquo;s royalty cannot resist. When Arlecio went too far and killed a thug, the gendarmerie settled it by suicide.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that, no one dared to challenge Arlecio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are here to talk about the future of the business world, but this is not the time to quarrel with Arlecio. I, as a founder, will have to get through this, even if it means stepping out of line.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled and turned to face Arlecio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, well, well, Arlecio-san. What a surprise to see you here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahn? What&rsquo;s with that tone? Hey, you look like you&rsquo;re in some kind of shape while I&rsquo;m watching you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hey, this is scary&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio&rsquo;s threats don&rsquo;t involve shouting or anything like that, but it&rsquo;s like a bite to the gut.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m going to chatter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Blumund, I was also called the king of the backstreets, but in front of such a &ldquo;real&rdquo; deal, I am reminded of how small I can feel&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, Mr. Arlecio, it&rsquo;s a happy occasion. I&rsquo;ll tell you about it later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bydd is also under pressure from Arlecio. He seems to know about Arlecio and is now afraid of him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t speak for other people either, and on the contrary, I&rsquo;ve even reviewed Bydd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the past, I would never have tried to go against Arlecio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it leaves a bad taste.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you want? You call my name so casually, but who gave you permission? Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio&rsquo;s attention is shifting from me to Bydd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as I suspected, this man doesn&rsquo;t remember Bydd. I guess he didn&rsquo;t think he was worth remembering, either.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that Arlecio would not tolerate being accosted by such a small person without permission. He&rsquo;s in a terrible mood.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the old days I would have put my hands on some money to see him out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But today, that&rsquo;s not going to happen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am a representative of the Four Nations Trade Federation and I will not be taken for a fool by our enemies at this time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The people around me are laughing at us now, instead of helping us. This may be a show and a diversion, but I&rsquo;ll lose my position if we allow this to go on unchecked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I can&rsquo;t handle this kind of trouble, I&rsquo;ll only draw the ire of the guests.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arlecio, you misunderstand me. I&rsquo;m a representative of the Four Nations Trade Federation. I&rsquo;ll let you off one the basis of our old friendship, so leave quickly!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said to Arlecio, poised in a relaxed manner. I struggled to keep my voice from trembling, but I was relieved that I managed to do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is this what you call a killer intent?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The air around Arlecio changes, his eyes narrowing as he stares at me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m scared shitless.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Myo-Myourmiles-san&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bydd shuffled to his feet and called out to me in a tearful voice. But there was no time to answer and I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off Arlecio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, Myourmiles. Are you sure you didn&rsquo;t misunderstand? Or maybe you did. Do you think I can&rsquo;t get to you in this kind of a public place?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I do think so!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one with a bit of wisdom would meddle with a man of high rank in a place like this. It wouldn&rsquo;t be natural for a monster that follows their instincts, but someone with common sense would usually put up with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, Arlecio is Don Gabbana&rsquo;s bodyguard. If you make trouble here, it would get your employer into trouble.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just when I thought I was absolutely safe, I felt Arlecio&rsquo;s left hand shaking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In that moment, Bydd was pulled down and Gobemon-dono was in front of me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that in that instant, Arlecio tried to hit me. Gobemon-dono then covered me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Gobemon-dono who pulled Bydd over, and if he&rsquo;d just left him there, it could&rsquo;ve been dangerous. As proof, Bydd&rsquo;s ear is torn off by the pressure of Arlecio&rsquo;s fist.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you okay, Bydd?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, yes. I&rsquo;m sorry, I can&rsquo;t help you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t bother me. Rimuru-sama will be very angry if you die here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, are you going to get angry for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ll be mad at you, too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m reaching out to Bydd and pulling him up. Meanwhile, sparks were flying between Gobemon-dono and Arlecio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Were you trying to kill me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was an accident, an accident. I was just trying to give you a quick pat on the back. I guess that&rsquo;s why that punk over there fell over because you interfered.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. I&rsquo;m still a work in progress, but Bydd is like a little brother. I&rsquo;ve been looking up and watching, but you, that&rsquo;s too much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fuhaha, it&rsquo;s bad because that guy is weak. You&rsquo;re not allowed to bring weapons into this place, so you&rsquo;re not going to die from a little poke.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;Oh yeah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wow, the atmosphere in Gobemon-dono is changing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought that this would no longer be a meeting, but then Don Gabbana arrived at that very moment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arlecio , what are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.67px; height: 1128.80px;"><img alt="IMAGE YAKUZA STANDOFF" src="images/image7.jpg" style="width: 793.67px; height: 1128.80px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oops, Gabbana-san. Nothing really, I was just saying hello to my old friend for a bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah? I guess so. You there, you&rsquo;re hurt. Here, use this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What a bloody farce.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Threats and intercessions, trying to do me a favor and holding my head down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio knows just what to do. He&rsquo;s just sprinkling Bydd with the restorative without a second thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A sprinkle on Bydd&rsquo;s suit instantly restored Bydd&rsquo;s ear. That kind of efficacy can only be the complete recovery potion (full potion).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ooh, to use your precious &ldquo;full potion&rdquo; on such a low-ranking person!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As expected of Gabbana-dono! For him, he doesn&rsquo;t even mind using a rare, secret potion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Arlecio-dono&rsquo;s prowess combined with Gabbana-dono&rsquo;s financial strength is truly invincible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What&rsquo;s that? I went pale as soon as I heard that voice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly I wasn&rsquo;t scared anymore and I felt like I&rsquo;d just woken up from a nightmare.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I look at Bydd and he&rsquo;s very puzzled. I guess he&rsquo;s feeling the same way I am.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because, ain&rsquo;t that right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The full potion is a familiar sight to us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every now and then, Gobemon-dono trains Bydd too, but I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times he&rsquo;s had his arms and legs chopped off in one day. If he didn&rsquo;t have the full potion, he wouldn&rsquo;t be alive today.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve always had the full potion on hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Listening to those who appreciate it made me realize again how blessed we are now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh. and look! Behold the bright badge on Gabbana-dono&rsquo;s chest!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I see it too. That crest is shining.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right. That means it&rsquo;s made of genuine magisteel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No doubt, it&rsquo;s just as they say. An up-and-coming, mysterious organization is absorbing all the illegal organizations. And this organization&rsquo;s very crest is exactly what it looks like.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The voice from the outside intrigued me, so I looked at Don Gabbana&rsquo;s chest, only to be astonished.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There, shining in a familiar pattern, were three snakes intertwined, snaking their way around.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No wonder they were so familiar. I had spent three days and three nights thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I recall, Rimuru-sama said, &ldquo;Why not just make it a snake? Rather than dragons and phoenixes&hellip; simple is better. Besides, the snake symbolizes wisdom, desire and eternity, which is perfect for the Three Drunk Sages, right?&rdquo; And older sister agreed too. She said, &ldquo;Well, snakes also have the image being drunk, so it might suit us.&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Wahahahaha! Then let&rsquo;s make the three snakes intertwine. Let&rsquo;s make them snake around like the three of us. No matter how you look at it, it&rsquo;s the Three Drunk Sages!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I haven&rsquo;t heard about the members in detail, but was Don Gabbana&rsquo;s organization also absorbed by it&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that I know, I&rsquo;m feeling a bit jumpy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this is my chance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s make sure Don Gabbana stands out from the crowd to showcase my position.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are, I believe, the chairman of the Gabbana Trading Company. Now, how do you wish to make amends for this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are not aware? Apologize for injuring my escort. Bydd wouldn&rsquo;t go against that thug just because of a situation like this. And now he&rsquo;s gone too far, just because we wouldn&rsquo;t hurt him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m a thug?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is great fun. It seems that both look bewildered by my counterattack.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with that man!? What&rsquo;s that man doing challenging Gabbana-dono?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gabbana-dono is a member of the mysterious Three Drunk Sages, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. I heard that a major militant group has fallen under the umbrella of the Three Drunk Sages. And yet&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a daredevil&hellip; or do you have a secret plan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it, but the Four Nations Trade Federation has a plan to counter the Three Drunk Sages. You really think you can!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The outsiders may be annoyed, but it seems to stand out in the public eye, so I shall bear it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Now, more than that</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead, man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, wait, Arlecio. It&rsquo;s not good here. Besides, it&rsquo;s not much fun if you kill it easily.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;All right, Gabbana-san. This one&rsquo;s for later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First, I&rsquo;ve got to do something about these bastards who are hiding in plain sight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I shouted to him on the spot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My voice didn&rsquo;t shake. I can feel my voice returning to normal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s almost as if the fear Arlecio had instilled in me a moment ago was a lie. Now that I think about it, it&rsquo;s only natural.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, I&rsquo;ve had conversations with much scarier beings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don Gabbana would be no better than a bug from Veldora-sama&rsquo;s point of view. All he&rsquo;d have to do is release his aura and Gabbana would be no more.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio might be able to hold out, but it&rsquo;d only be putting off the inevitable. All Veldora-sama would have to do is turn on the killing intent, and he&rsquo;d be gone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I usually deal with Veldora-sama and others who are that scary. I&rsquo;ve even refused to bargain for a raise in pocket money.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there are also many calamity-class majins living in that town.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s my job to manage the accounts of the inhabitants of the monster country. Even those that could easily wipe out small nations are begging me to make their budgets work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;d yell at them and chase them away&hellip; it&rsquo;s hard to believe it, but it&rsquo;s become my daily life now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of which, Cien-dono and I had a little chat the other day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, Testarossa-dono is very good and fast at what she does, which is a great help to me. And she&rsquo;s beautiful. I envy you, Cien-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? Well, well, well, hahaha! Myourmiles-sama has a very good sense of humor. I haven&rsquo;t laughed so much in a long time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was laughing a lot even though he was usually so calm and collected. After that, he liked me for some reason, and we became good friends, so much so that sometimes we went out for drinks together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then I remembered that Testarossa-dono was a terrible demon. Her appearance was deceiving. Her graceful demeanor and soft smile made me think she wasn&rsquo;t so scary.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s well known that Testarossa-dono gave the council a hard time, so I tried to keep a modest attitude.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sexual harassment, no! Absolutely never!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s our slogan at work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a digression, but there are many great people in our office. Now that I remembered, there was no reason to be afraid of Don Gabbana or Arlecio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;You</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don Gabbana and his friends are all red-faced and furious, but that doesn&rsquo;t make me feel anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not only me, but Bydd too, seems to have had a reality check.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, Myourmiles-san is a gentleman so I&rsquo;ll say it for you instead, but your tone of voice is not very nice, is it? Myourmiles-san can&rsquo;t talk to you like you do!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or so he says.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, with this, the line of sight in the venue was nailed, and it was a great show. Let&rsquo;s beat Don Gabbana to the punch and complete the ratings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here&rsquo;s where I showed a fearless smile.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m not much of a fighter, but I have a reputation for having a bad face.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Bydd is right. I should have disciplined him from the start, not chided him for his old friendship.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Myourmiles-san. That way, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to put up with it, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have been hurt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Smart man. And how am I supposed to make him pay for what he did?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;First, he should apologize to you. It&rsquo;s not too late to learn from that attitude!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Oh, Arlecio, and Gabbana-dono. I can close my eyes for this if you apologize now. But if you insist on making things worse, that&rsquo;s another story. I, Gard Myourmiles, Minister of Finance of the Jura Tempest Federation, and representative of the &ldquo;Four Nations Trade Federation,&rdquo; will buy the quarrel! How about it, eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said that as if I were about to make a big spectacle of myself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their faces are twitching as they listen to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Y-You&hellip;&rdquo;</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, Arlecio. Calm down. If it looks like there was a misunderstanding, and you were offended by us, then let&rsquo;s apologize. Myourmiles-kun, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, no&hellip;Myourmiles-dono&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I asked him back, Don Gabbana sounded frustrated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ve won, I thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are many great merchants here. Not only from the Ingracia Kingdom, but also from other nations, whose wealth is valued by these merchants.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don Gabbana was forced to recognize me in front of these great men and women.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I guess it was out of the calculations, but it was sweet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is staring at me with cold, snake-like eyes, but I am not afraid. I&rsquo;m sure I would have cried and apologized if it was in the past.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. So, what&rsquo;s the misunderstanding?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don Gabbana bowed, a blue streak on his forehead as he set out the rescue ship.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;My guards got ahead of themselves this time, and I&rsquo;m sorry for the inconvenience.

Do they teach you to laugh and easily forgive people for hurting you? My Bydd had to suffer the shame of losing an ear, remember?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The full potion&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hah! You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about if you try to fool me with such cheap medicine!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I laughed out loud.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, I still have a few of those potionos because Rimuru-sama let me keep them. It wasn&rsquo;t a lie, so I said so emphatically.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are not worthy of participating in the grand scheme I have planned to call upon you to carry out. Leave this place!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don Gabbana scowled as I shouted at him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, in a chilling voice&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you regret it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you regret it&rdquo; he said, for me only, and left the hall with Arlecio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a complete victory for me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The hall had been quiet for a while, but as soon as Don Gabbana disappeared, the audience erupted in cheers. But there were not just positive reactions. There were also some malicious voices in the crowd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m sure the consensus was that they didn&rsquo;t think I would get rid of Don Gabbana.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I, seeing my chance to get the attention, made the opening statement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then afterwards, I unveiled the &ldquo;Blumund Distribution System&rdquo; that I had discussed with Rimuru-sama and Veryard-dono, and succeeded in attracting the interest of many people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, they did not agree to join the project on the spot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason is simple.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By Don Gabbana, or rather, by the Three Drunk Sages, they thought I&rsquo;d be killed off for fighting with them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the organizers are going to be gone, then go after their replacements. If the core group is gone, the project may go down the tubes. This is not a matter for the big merchants to rush into, is it?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;s good for me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I will have more credibility if I can survive here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that&rsquo;s with the Three Drunk Sages.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">I am one-third of the Three Drunk Sages, and victory is guaranteed.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, I gave a passionate speech to my heart&rsquo;s content.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The venue was filled with enthusiasm and the meeting was very lively.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the next morning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we came out of the hotel, there was a black carriage parked in front of us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s a pretty bold thing for a public figure to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Get in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio announces in a low voice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I grinned and climbed into the carriage with Bydd and Gobemon-dono.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">you&rsquo;ve got some nerve!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio comes aboard at the end of the ride and threatens us, but from what I can see, he&rsquo;s just a sore loser.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So where are we going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A nice place. Well, enjoy your last ride.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then Arlecio keeps his mouth shut.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t seem to want to say anything else, so we got into the carriage without saying a word.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The carriage arrived at our destination after about twenty minutes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Judging from the distance from the hotel, this must be an upscale residential area. In other words, it&rsquo;s the place that I had guessed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was truly relieved.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I&rsquo;d been taken to Don Gabbana&rsquo;s domain, I would have panicked a little. But now we have nothing to worry about.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is where the Apostles of Vert used to have a base in Ingracia. I helped to renovate this place, so I know it well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stay down. The scariest people you could ever imagine are waiting for you down the road. I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing you crawling around, spewing shit and piss and begging for your life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I look at Arlecio with pity as he threatens me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This guy&rsquo;s a pitiful guy, too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it, bastard? What&rsquo;s that look in your eyes!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s all right. It&rsquo;s not going to happen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This guy&rsquo;s going to die.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What!? You&hellip;what the hell are you talking about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think Arlecio sensed something about my attitude. He has a slightly uneasy face.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s a group of men lined up in front of the mansion that stands there. As soon as the carriage stops, they come running.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of them speaks to Arlecio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arlecio-san. It&rsquo;s a message.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, some of the higher-ups are waiting downstairs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Upstairs&rdquo;? &lsquo;The Seven Blades?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip; more like&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me that an old wise man from the &lsquo;Wise Men&rsquo;s Club&rsquo; or the group of evil shinobi from the &lsquo;Dark Heavenly Clan&hellip;&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Those people were the guides.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;The three leaders</span><span class="c9">&mdash;!</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio is astonished, but I&rsquo;m so unfamiliar with these people that I have no idea what they&rsquo;re like.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the sound of the conversation, I&rsquo;m guessing they&rsquo;re not in the Gabbana family. I guess they&rsquo;re still newcomers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, even I don&rsquo;t know exactly which organizations the Three Drunk Sages have under their umbrella. That&rsquo;s why such unfortunate events are happening.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though I knew about the underworld, I&rsquo;m surprised there are so many organizations in the Western Nations&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gabbana-san was taken earlier.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay. Hey, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Accompanied by a look of triumph on Arlecio&rsquo;s face, we stepped into the mansion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were headed for the basement, but it&rsquo;s still a luxurious place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Apostles of Vert originally enshrined an altar, but that was torn down and replaced with an audience chamber.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s idea to make the room&rsquo;s atmosphere more important.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He believed that a secret society should be like a secret society, and was thus very particular about the details.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It might even be more luxurious than the one in the monster country.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I control the budget over there too, so I can&rsquo;t allow them to waste it. But here, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what is done with the money earned, because it&rsquo;s an evil organization.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;why are you so calm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps due to anxiety, Arlecio spoke to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I answered, and he gave me a little &ldquo;tsk&rdquo;. He remained silent the rest of the way until we came to a large door on the third floor below.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Enter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And, Mr. Vigan from the Seven Blades, you&rsquo;re a doorkeeper?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tsk, Arlecio. I was thinking of you. I&rsquo;d give you a pass on Seven Blades if it was vacant. Idiot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, no, Vigan-san! What did I do?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just quickly get the hell inside! Hey, you guys wait here. I was told only the guests and Arlecio can go in there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vigan told him, staring at Arlecio&rsquo;s men.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, that&rsquo;s about right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fewer people who know I&rsquo;m one of the bosses, the better.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I say nothing here, and follow quietly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that said, Arlecio enters, followed by us. Vigan is the last to enter the room, and the door is closed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The door has been magically sealed so that no sound can escape. No one outside can tell what&rsquo;s going on inside.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though the room is underground, it&rsquo;s bright and shiny. Countless wax candles lit the room at varying degrees of intensity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru-sama said that there was no need to use candles when they could be made by magic. It was in this waste that romance was found.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The basement floor is not divided, so it&rsquo;s more of a hall than a room. That&rsquo;s why it can be used as an audience room, but only executives are allowed in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And by &ldquo;executives,&rdquo; I mean those who know who I am. But more than half the people inside this room are people I don&rsquo;t know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I walk proudly into the room with all eyes fixed on me, nearly a hundred of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio shouts to stop me, but I ignore him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio tries to put his hand on my shoulder, but Vigan knocks him down before Bydd or Gobemon-dono can move. He was told about me when he was named doorkeeper.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reaction of the other executives who I did not know were also different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some were surprised and others were baffled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They saw everyone who knew me kneel down at once and guessed who I was. They followed my example and hung their heads in unison.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No way, Myourmiles, you are the leader?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The room is quiet, and I can hear Don Gabbana&rsquo;s stunned voice. The air-conditioning is good, but the voice echoes because the room is underground.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don Gabbana was in the back of the room, addressing a man I know well. Perhaps he was negotiating to have me killed as an example to an insolent new organization, the Four Nations Trade Federation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The one you&rsquo;ve been working so hard to persuade, hoping to inflict a horrible death, is the one of your three great leaders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don Gabbana was answered not by me, but by a woman in a flamboyant and revealing dress.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glenda Atlee, the woman who plays the boss of the Three Drunk Sages on behalf of me and my friends.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And her words confirmed what I had thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, somehow, even though it&rsquo;s about me, I feel like it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s affair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Geh, hey, whaaa</span><span class="c9">&mdash;!</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The cool-headed Don Gabbana is sitting up in shock. I never thought I&rsquo;d be witnessing something so outrageous like this when I was a nobody back in my day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Glenda, thank you for your help. Thanks to you, the plan is on track. Our meeting was a great success yesterday.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Thank you very much for the compliment! In that case, I&rsquo;d love to see the merit points</span><span class="c9">&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;ll give you twice the amount I usually give you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that. That&rsquo;s my leader, he knows what he&rsquo;s talking about!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glenda led me to the former altar.

That&rsquo;s how much everyone fears her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now, right in front of me, Don Gabbana and Arlecio are hauled up and held down. I must decide how to deal with Don Gabbana, who had advised to kill the leader (me), and Arlecio, who has spoken rudely to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The executives are unanimous in their desire to see them dead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Only death will redeem the disrespect to our leader.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better not to kill him comfortably. By way of example, let&rsquo;s give them seven days of torment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right. It would be fun to sacrifice them to the devil, and it would be fun to make a synthetic beast out of their corpses.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The man himself was happy to talk about how to kill the chieftain. Now is the time. You should try everything he said in person!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so on and so forth, the brutal discussion continued.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don Gabbana has lost color and is breathing hard. A stain has formed on his trousers, but I&rsquo;ll pretend I didn&rsquo;t see it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio looks pale.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He must have realized his fate and is calculating whether or not he should resist.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there are some powerful men in this room, from the underworld. I could have many off them killed in heartbeat if I were alone, but many of the other leaders are the best in the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I couldn&rsquo;t defeat them all, even if I fought them. Glenda would stand a better chance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The heat in the room grows louder and louder as the executives grow more and more outspoken.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I&rsquo;m not sure what to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I ponder while looking at the two who hang their heads in surrender.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Honestly, these two are at fault, but they are not entirely guilty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Threatening an up-and-coming force is a perfectly natural thing for an underworlder to do. Disrespecting the boss of your organization is a problem, but that&rsquo;s because he didn&rsquo;t know my face.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was pissed off at the assault on Bydd, but it didn&rsquo;t matter when I looked at the results. And since Rimuru-sama knew about this incident, someone was supposed to be protecting us from anything that might happen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are several of Souei-dono&rsquo;s men here as well. Therefore, I&rsquo;m sure there is no danger in that regard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, then disposing of Don Gabbana is a bit much.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I silenced them all as I gathered my thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t dispose of them. Gabbana didn&rsquo;t betray the organization. He just didn&rsquo;t know that I was the leader. If he betrays me in the future, that&rsquo;s another matter, but I&rsquo;ll let him off the hook.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was a little pissed off at times, but that&rsquo;s bearable. That&rsquo;s how I decided.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, some people weren&rsquo;t happy about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How naive! That&rsquo;s no way to represent the organization!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Many agreed with those who shouted that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some went so far as to say&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Chieftain&hellip;you are an amateur, aren&rsquo;t you? You know, for an underworlder like us, face is the most important thing, right? If you don&rsquo;t take a swing at them now, no one will follow you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of them even began to look down on me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could have let them off the hook if they only wanted to complain about my decision. But this was no good.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Whoever said that, step forward.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I said this, a scowling young man stepped forward.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Yang of the &lsquo;Black Claws.&rsquo; During our time together as mercenaries, we fought together, and I was a harsh man who was merciless towards the enemy. My personal strength is also quite impressive. I have a rank of A.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And before I knew it, Girard, who was standing next to me, told me. &ldquo;He was the leader of the Apostles of Vert.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded at him and looked at Yang.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;re called Yang.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m an amateur?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Am I wrong?

But I don&rsquo;t want the Three Drunk Sages to be that kind of an organization.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, apart from me, it&rsquo;s impossible to kick down Rimuru-sama and older sister out of office.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I must tell them here and now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to oppose me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I ask, who&rsquo;s going to oppose me?

It looks like it was Glenda who crushed the Black Claws, not the Apostles of Vert.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You say it&rsquo;s all about saving face. So, Yang, aren&rsquo;t you the one who should be held accountable for the way you treated me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Glenda, about those merit points you mentioned earlier, I knew it was a no-go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Oh no, that</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up!

Do you have a problem with it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;&ldquo;Hahaaa</span><span class="c9">&mdash;!!&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They all prostrated themselves to show respect for my decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yang, rejoice. I&rsquo;ll let you off the hook for once. But there will not be a second time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course! Thank you. I will work as hard as I can to repay you for this favor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s good to know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, I am satisfied.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now that I have complete control of the Three Drunk Sages, I&rsquo;ve decided to take this opportunity to enact a fundamental discipline.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One: Never betray your fellow man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two: Have the heart to forgive the failure of others.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Three: Do not kick others down and make them unhappy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those three things are the basics, aren&rsquo;t they?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a matter of course not to betray your fellow man, and anyone who breaks this rule is punishable by death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is difficult to forgive others&rsquo; failures, but the Three Drunk Sages will be the final resting place for those who fail. There will be a few excellent people, so I have told my subordinates to cover for their mistakes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This kind of thing can only get better if we raise awareness from above. Thus, I took this opportunity with all the executives in attendance to make sure it was done right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The last rule of not kicking someone down and making them unhappy is the most important one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Three Drunk Sages will bring together the armed forces of the underworld, and if you pay attention to this, the merchants out in the open will have no chance to compete. However, from now on, such evil deeds will be banned altogether.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From now on, they must realize that their influence is different from what they have been doing up until now, and aim to contribute to society in a fairer and more straightforward manner.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rather than a lawless and violent group, we must become &ldquo;chivalrous guests&rdquo; who help the weak and defat the tyrants. It is not only my wish, but Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should lose our pride.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the top rots, those below cannot resist. This is also true for me and I&rsquo;ll keep it in mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be mindful that this is what the Three Drunk Sages are called upon to do, though it will be difficult to change your way of life. Let the young ones slowly learn that there is more than one way to live.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I concluded, the executives looked puzzled and thought about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to doing the dirty work. It&rsquo;s not going to change their minds anytime soon. But with the help of me, or rather Rimuru-sama, it&rsquo;s not impossible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have been able to silence their opposition with force, but since we are dealing with people who believe that force is justice, this is the right way to go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hoped that this will give an impetus to the people to change.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Gabbana family was disbanded, and its members were transferred to other organizations. Gabbana is now under my direct control and will work under a new name, at Blumund Headquarters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s a man who is good with money and accounts. It&rsquo;s a waste to just leave him there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was a pain in the ass, but I put him in charge of train operations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, it was Rimuru-sama that was the root of all evil.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He just comes up with stuff, and then makes me do all the work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, well, that&rsquo;s okay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s my job, and I don&rsquo;t deny that it&rsquo;s a very attractive plan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I would also like to remind him that I have only one body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And unlike Rimuru-sama, I am a very ordinary person and need a good night&rsquo;s sleep. It&rsquo;s hard to refuse when he says, &ldquo;Please, Myourmiles-kun!&rdquo; but the reason I forgo the project is for my health.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that excuse wouldn&rsquo;t work either, especially now that I&rsquo;ve started earning this much money.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was at this time that I was lucky to have Gabbana working for me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabbana said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful, but I&rsquo;ve got a lot of work to do! I didn&rsquo;t expect it to be this hard!&rdquo; He complains every day, however I was also ridiculed by Rimuru-sama for that job, so if he has a grudge, he should take it to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I felt a little guilty about it, so I thought I&rsquo;d give him better pay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio was left in Gobemon-dono&rsquo;s care.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because of the history with Bydd, Gobemon-dono wanted to straighten things out with a match.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio didn&rsquo;t have the right to refuse, but the match was agreed on the condition that if he won, he would be picked as an executive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The result was, of course, a landslide victory for Gobemon-dono.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now you understand. There&rsquo;s always someone better than you. Even I&rsquo;m at the bottom of the heap back home. Strength is not something that&rsquo;s openly displayed, but rather something locked inside. It must be exercised correctly to protect what is absolutely essential. That&rsquo;s what I was taught. It&rsquo;s not too late for you to take another good &nbsp;look at yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arlecio must have been awakened by what he said to me. He volunteered to become Gobemon-dono&rsquo;s younger brother.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Gabbana and his friends were dealt with amicably, but the official announcement was different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Three Drunk Sages must be used to mark the spectacular debut of the Four Nations Trade Federation. At the same time, we must find a way to prevent the Three Drunk Sages from being taken for a fool.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why we crushed the mansion we had purchased for the Ingracia branch of the Four Nations Trade Federation to smithereens. I had the workers evacuated so they would be safe, but this is sure to have a huge impact on the public.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reporters under Diablo-dono wrote a really good article about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, I was featured in the article as well as the horror of the Three Drunk Sages, but I was not deterred by it. I&rsquo;m the Finance Minister of the Monster Country, and that explains why I do not succumb to unwarranted violence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The breakup of the Gabbana family was also a big story, and I was able to show that the Four Nations Trade Federation is a much bigger organization than people thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, rumors were spread that the Three Drunk Sages and the Four Nations Trade Federation were splitting up. This was accepted by the public, and the dispute was settled safely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Four Nations Trade Federation is now up and running without a hitch and when I saw the profits from each branch, I was at a loss for words.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I were to speak frankly, I could make dozens of gold coins in an hour, and more than my annual income in a day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The annual income in this case is equivalent to my salary as a minister in the Monster Country&hellip;so in the eyes of the average person, I&rsquo;m a man who makes more money per hour than they do in a whole year.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, Benimaru-dono and Souei-dono are also paid by Three Drunk Sages. It&rsquo;s about fifty gold coins a month.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m sure Souei-dono&rsquo;s subordinates in the Three Drunk Sages should be paid a great deal more than that, including necessary expenses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, it&rsquo;s hard to show the men under my command that the executives are poor. Glenda and Girard, playing the boss, were getting paid handsomely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We also get a fine, but Rimuru-sama, older sister, and I each get two percent of all the profits. The money is paid yearly, and I&rsquo;ve heard that we&rsquo;ve accumulated an astonishing amount so far.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I consider myself a fortunate man, but this is too unrealistic to the point of being scary.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this isn&rsquo;t the end of my ambitions. This is not the time to dream big and be content with small successes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My name is Myourmiles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man whose fate was changed when he met Rimuru-sama.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I will do my best to see how far I can go in this life so that I will not regret it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My challenge will not end until I am at the brink of my final death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c11" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c15">Chapter 2<br>Distant Memories</span></h1><p class="c11 c2"><span class="c8 c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd took her first leap into the strange space between unknown worlds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There, she found herself unbounded by time and confronted her inner self. By doing so, she made the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Divine Flame King&rsquo; (Cthugha) completely her own.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Divine Flame King&rsquo; (Cthugha) had the power to track Rudra&rsquo;s soul. Strictly speaking, the effect was to discover an entity once specified.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd can now find pieces of her beloved Rudra&rsquo;s soul, no matter how remote or far away they are, even beyond time and space.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All she has to do now is &ldquo;jump&rdquo; for it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a perfect combination of Spacetime Manipulation and Dimension Leap, a technique that is only possible with the Ultimate Skill&rsquo;s ever-growing power.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it was impossible to jump to a specific time and place because the target coordinates could not be determined. In other words, the &lsquo;Spacetime Leap&rsquo; is only possible when there is a destination.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this does not apply if the time and space are the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even &lsquo;Instantaneous Movement&rsquo; was possible because it could travel over any distance without regard to time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why Velgrynd relied on her own authority to pursue Rudra.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First, she found herself on a starry continent where civilization was still in its infancy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A barbarian chief with bronze skin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young, blond-haired youth was the one who had a fragment of Rudra&rsquo;s soul in him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young men were hunters and had eventually settled in the Great River Valley.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd helped them without her own weight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She brought rain and conquered the great rivers and made the land fertile.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was around this time that she began to move away from hunting and pursued agriculture. Their food situation improved greatly and the number of mouths they could feed increased. Soon the village one that was feared by the surrounding villages.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It makes sense for the rich to be targeted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Velgrynd prepared her next move.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She gave them a high-temperature furnace hot enough to withstand the melting point of iron, which could be called out of place in that era. This allowed the people to skip bronze ware from stone tools, and take possession of iron tools instead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was decided that the surrounding villages would be swallowed and combined together, and the land eventually developed into a kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The throne was passed on to sons and grandchildren.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd stopped helping the kingdom and simply stuck with what she loved. No matter how much they begged her, she did not exercise her authority.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because that&rsquo;s what her beloved wanted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am indebted to you more than I can ever repay. But I don&rsquo;t want more. It will be too much power for those fools when I retire as king.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, okay. Rudra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd had no reason to help the king&rsquo;s sons and grandsons, since they lacked a trace of soul. She could help on a whim, but as the king&rsquo;s desire was for his children to be independent, Velgrynd would respect that will.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Tsk, not &lsquo;Rudra&rsquo; again. My name i</span><span class="c9">s&mdash;</span><span class="c0">tch, if I have other lovers, is it any wonder if I&rsquo;m not taken seriously?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmmm. Jealous? You&rsquo;re so cute.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up. I&rsquo;m going to kill you alive in front of such a superb woman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">True to his word, the man who rose from barbarian chief to the first king of the Arcia Kingdom, the founder of the Great River Civilization, treated her like she was his goddess, but he never embraced Velgrynd in his arms.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd was fine with that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her role is to watch over.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Loved ones beget children and the bloodline is inherited. And so she waits for another piece of Rudra&rsquo;s soul to dwell in their offspring.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the Velgrynd should be.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A time of growth and prosperity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The good times pass quickly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man had grown old and was now an old man waiting for his death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was happy. Goddess. You&mdash;you called me master, but did I live up to it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, enough. I was happy, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m relieved to hear that. Bless you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those were the last words of a great king.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a muffled cry, he gave his soul to Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this way, Velgrynd got the &lsquo;soul&rsquo; she desired.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was only a fragment of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The journey has just begun, and Velgrynd leaps toward her next destination.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Kingdom eventually conquered the surrounding nations and became an empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who remained, left it for posterity in the form of biographies.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, a myth was born.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man&rsquo;s blood runs through the veins of the Holy Arcia Empire, where Velgrynd has long been revered as the Goddess of Creation, who controls the flames.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd had a series of encounters and goodbyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Through it all, Velgrynd came to understand that there is no single world that Veldanava has created.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He created many worlds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was one world, and there were no parallel worlds. But there were other worlds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were &lsquo;otherworlders,&rsquo; so she was aware of that fact, but Velgrynd had never imagined that there were so many different worlds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were governed by completely different laws, and there was no causality. It was a material world within a great spiritual world of many different civilizations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the familiar world where swords and magic are the norm, to the world where magic is non-existent and cannot be used. There was also a rare world where scientific civilization had developed and humankind had become mechanized.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were weak worlds that could be blown away by a True Dragon if it unleashed all of its strength, and there were desolate worlds where angels and demons comparable to awakened Demon Lords were in constant conflict.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd had traveled through all those worlds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But all of it was not of her own intention, but by what she was guided to.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were different levels of civilization, and Velgrynd had no way of guessing which dimension or timeline she was in. Also, because parallel universes do not overlap, it is impossible for the same entity to overlap on the same timeline.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, just because you went there once does not mean you can go to the same place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the Velgrynd exists in the same dimension at the same time, the exact space-time coordinates can be recognized. However, as there is already a Velgrynd at that time, &lsquo;Spacetime Leap&rsquo; cannot be used to jump there, even with the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Divine Flame King (Cthugha).&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Velgrynd remembered all worlds, all of Rudra.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fleet commander of the interstellar world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The minister of a small country in the world of swords and magic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rare scammer in the world without magic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The poor scientist in the civilized world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd is often called upon at moments of crisis when one who possesses a fragment of Rudra&rsquo;s &lsquo;soul&rsquo; is in danger. It is only when he is on the verge of death that his soul shines forth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some people died as children because they couldn&rsquo;t get help in time. It was a very sad event, but Velgrynd is convinced that it was fate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there was no need to mourn, because then the soul shards would gather quickly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she didn&rsquo;t take it upon herself to hasten the time. It was the Velgrynd&rsquo;s pleasure to watch over Rudras of various personalities.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She realized early on that bloodlines were meaningless.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even physical characteristics meant nothing, some had dark hair, some had red hair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But all of them were &ldquo;Rudra&rdquo; to Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it would continue to be that way for many stars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The pieces of soul she had gathered were growing in size and regaining their beautiful form.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just by intuition, Velgrynd was convinced that there were only a few pieces of soul left.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next one or one after that would be the last.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, she did as she was called, and jumped into the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was called the Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the Emperor&rsquo;s room, Velgrynd appears from time and space.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is dressed in a silk robe.

The emperor&#39;s courage was considerable as he only spoke out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd didn&rsquo;t care.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh?

She wanted to let him live out his last hours in peace.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Minamoto who took the blame.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just Velgrynd&rsquo;s stare was enough to make him stiffen his whole body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just feeling the pressure of her gaze was enough to make him realize the vast difference in their abilities.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, it&rsquo;s not even that level.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The monsters and demons they&rsquo;ve dealt with are so obscure that they almost seemed cute in comparison.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as his master Gensei&rsquo;s sword failed to get through, he knew that the Velgrynd was trouble. He had no choice but to realize that even that was still a naive perception.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I&rsquo;m not going to be able to do my job</span><span class="c0">, Minamoto thought ruefully. So, at the very least, he summoned up all the courage he could muster and glared at Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Are you the demon&rsquo;s head, Kai?</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Did you get tired of the skirmishes and have come to us yourself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was just talking in a cold sweat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a statement meant to expose her, but Velgrynd sees through it and replies without a care in the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A demon? So, there are demons in this world too. They really spring up everywhere, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, so you have nothing to do with demons?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not related. In the first place, I&rsquo;m not sure if the demon you&rsquo;re talking about is the same ones I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd can parse and speak any language from any world with fluency. It is a special skill that does not rely on authority because it can read the &quot;thoughts&quot; that fly around in the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, some similar concepts can be confused, and care must be taken not to make a mistake.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this case, the word &ldquo;demon&rdquo; is important.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What Velgrynd knows is that it is a phantom race with the demon king Feldway at the top. He was an Aggressor tribe in every dimension and had many collisions with the Velgrynd throghout her long journey.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd was disgusted that he was there this time as well, but at the same time, she also considered the possibility that he might be different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A demon is a demon. I myself do not know much about them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The answer to Velgrynd&rsquo;s question came not from Minamoto, but from the Emperor himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei immediately changed his mind when he saw that Minamoto was unable to move. While Minamoto was attracting his attention, Gensei tried to get the Emperor to flee.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei and his team&rsquo;s trust in each other was at an all-time high as they changed roles at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although there was no chance of success, the plan to let the Empeeror escape was worth a try. But the Emperor himself had stopped it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your Majesty!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. Why do I get a familiar feeling from this person? And where in the world are we going to escape to when we&rsquo;re already in the safest place in the heavily fortified Imperial City? This person evaded all security measures to get to this place. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d be able to escape.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was just as the Emperor had said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Empire, the country of the Grand Duke, was now at war with a formidable enemy. That&rsquo;s why they were on high alert, and any attempt to sneak through it would be tantamount to defeat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, the Emperor couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to be wary of Velgrynd. As he said, he felt a nostalgic feeling, which was somewhat comforting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So the Emperor decided to believe in Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He decided to tell her what was going on, and if it was possible, he wanted her to become his ally.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The current location is still the Emperor&rsquo;s quarters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had ordered the maid to prepare tea and snacks for us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let me introduce myself first. My name is Velgrynd, as I said before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am Araki Gensei. I am the guardian of the kingdom and the protector of His Majesty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am the third-ranked member of the Imperial Guard, Minamoto Saburo. I have been appointed as a captain of the Imperial Guard Swordsmen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, nice to meet you. And Rudra?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd was not interested in those two.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She brushed off the greetings from them and turned her attention back to her beloved.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;At my age, I never thought I&rsquo;d be stared at by such a beautiful woman. I don&rsquo;t feel bad about it, but I can&rsquo;t help but feel sorry for my younger self.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, Rudra also flatters me. It&rsquo;s a rare experience.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Huh, it&rsquo;s not flattery, but oh well. I have been known as Sakura Akira.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;I thought it was reasonably well known, but I guess I just liked it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a posthumous name, widely known as the wise empeor, but it was a taboo. It is the true name of the emperor and should not be casually spoken.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even those closest to him would not call him by that name. But it was a name that everyone in the land knew with respect.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But to the Velgrynd, he was Rudra. She had no intention of calling him that from the stat, let alone not calling him &lsquo;Sakura.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ufufu, well, it&rsquo;s no wonder I don&rsquo;t know you. Because I came into this world the moment I first met you. The &lsquo;you&rsquo; who I know is named Rudra, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to keep calling you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To the others, she seemed rude to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was officially allowed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Emperor laughed it off.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Allowed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your Majesty!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. If it will buy the goddess&rsquo; pleasure, it&rsquo;s a small price to pay. However, I can&rsquo;t allow her to stand next to me in public.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, why is that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I, too, have my position. It would only cause my subjects unnecessary anxiety if there was someone calling me by a name they don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Velgrynd showed her power to everyone, it would be disruptive. The Emperor wanted to keep things quiet and out of sight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd understands this and stops asking for more. She would have listened quietly if Rudra had asked her, so she agreed for now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For now, it was more important to listen to the situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s think about to would do if we had to go out in public. So, can you explain to me what the situation is now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd is no dead weight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Rudra is in trouble, she&rsquo;ll do her best to help.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two guards got a headache from such a transcendental attitude.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">That Velgrynd is an unfathomable competitor. His Majesty was right. She may be a kind of god or goddess. Perhaps it&rsquo;s better to ask for cooperation rather than to humiliate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minamoto, on the other hand, is more complicated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">It&rsquo;s not an attitude towards His Majesty, but why? It just seems natural, doesn&rsquo;t it? This disqualifies me from being a bodyguard, but if the Emperor allows it, it&rsquo;s not my place to speak. But I don&rsquo;t know how I would explain it to His Highness or Her Highness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">More specifically, he was thinking about the problems that would arise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As an emperor, he can&rsquo;t be blamed for one or two mistresses and vice versa.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The birth of a child would also involve the issue of hereditary succession, so she must be a woman of strong family background. It was also necessary to make the position clear; there was an insurmountable difference in status between the empress and the concubine.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">In this case, the Velgrynd must be convinced to be a member of the household.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Is she really thee kind of woman who can live with that? If she insists on being the empress, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minamoto is the kind of person who worries about such things, but his real job is to protect the Imperial Palace. No, he was not overly concerned, as any trouble the Velgrynd might have with the Empress or her entourage would be a disaster.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a big difference in the psychological burden between Gensei, who only had to protect the Emperor, and Minamoto, who had to look out for the safety of the entire palace.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, right now, Minamoto thought it was time to answer Velgrynd&rsquo;s question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain that myself. The environment surrounding our country, the Empire, is very tense. One of the biggest enemies we have seen in the past&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Imperial State means the state ruled by Emperor, and is different in meaning from the Empire, which is the state of the Great Conquest. Unlike the name of the present, it was a title passed down from generation to generation in the eastern island nations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The emperor and his guardians protected their subjects from demons. But apart from that, the world was in turmoil.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the east, the Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the south, the United States of Azalea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the north, the Great Roziam Dynasty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the west, the Holy Arcia Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">In the center, the Middle Kingdom of China was working together with a Japanese country.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In each region, they emerged as the standard-bearers of the five major powers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Decades ago, they competed for supremacy, but eventually they came to an equilibrium. While looking with an eye on the decline of the other forces, the economic relationship had been maturing for some time. When this happened, conflict no longer surfaced, and peace seemed to have returned to the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dissatisfaction amongst the major powers has not disappeared. If there are those who make profit, then there will be those who will lose, and dissatisfaction will accumulate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, four years ago, it exploded.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The catalyst was a great drought in the middle of China</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Waterr shortages led to famine, and epidemics were rampant. Humanity was understandably distressed, but the Chinese government, in order to protect its own position, turned its discontent to the outside world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is what the whole world is caught up in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Chinese first turned their attention to the South, which was as rich in grain fields as their own. The National People&rsquo;s Congress unanimously voted to invade the United States of Azalea. This was the signal for the start of the war.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in the blink of an eye, warfare spread throughout the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing the Chinese move their armies, the North moved next. The Great Roziam Dynasty began its invasion of China.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The aim was clear: to secure a rich granary and a perennial port.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The country was suffering from the natural disaster of drought, but that would subside in a few years. Under such a decision, the Great Roziam Dynasty resurrected its hegemony.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Chinese would not allow it. It was decided to gather its remaining forces to counterattack and plunge the country into full-scale war.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The empire was caught in the middle of this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their dependence on the Chinese for food imports compelled them to send their troops to China in the name of humanitarian aid. It was an effort to bring this war to a quick conclusion, but the Great Roziam Dynasty was &nbsp;furious.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Relations with the United States of Azalea were also deteriorating.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Faced with a choice between Azalea and China, the Empire has chosen to ally itself with China, its lifeline.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the Empire is plunged into war with the United States of Azalea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Holy Arcia Empire did not budge at first, but that peace did not last for a year. This time a famine broke out in their own country, and they became unable to provide aid.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bad things continued to happen. There was an accident at the oil storage facility. As a result, three years&rsquo; worth of fuel was burned down. From the trail left at the site, the culprit was determined to be an agent of the Great Roziam Dynasty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The public sentiment in the Holy Arcia Empire was turning toward the anti-Great Roziamism. With that, the Holy Arcia Empire was able to take advantage of the momentum and take military action.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were those who questioned this course of events.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Mystery Monk Pulcinella is a member of the Holy Spirit Sect, one of the three major religions of Buddhism, Holy Spiritism, and Free Spirit</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said he sensed someone&rsquo;s malice and left the oracle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After hearing these words, the Holy Churches around the world began to investigate and found a clue to the existence of the demon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was already too late.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your desires stimulated and anger inflamed for the right reasons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame, but you&rsquo;re right.

And yet, there were extremists in the military as well. Even those people took advantage of the enemy&rsquo;s machinations and began to be active, and by the time they found themselves in a position where they realized it, there was no way to stop it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To Minamoto&rsquo;s explanation, Gensei added, &ldquo;The same is true in other countries.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same was true in each country, and now it is out of line with the upper management.

And the trouble is, it had nothing to do with the home country&rsquo;s intentions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the Chinese leadership didn&rsquo;t know about it, there was no way for even our intelligence officers to know about it. By the time they found out, it was too late, and they had already caused a painful loss.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the defeat was not in vain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This information was brought to you by my apprentice, who risked his life for it.

And then he lost contact with them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei seriously said that he might have made his life ephemeral.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing that, Velgrynd understands.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man in Gensei&rsquo;s story is Lieutenant Kondou, whom Velgrynd knows well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That Kondou was fascinated by Rudra because he felt the same way about Emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kondou instinctively knew that Rudra and Akira Sakura&rsquo;s &lsquo;soul&rsquo; were one and the same. And so, for the first time, Velgrynd felt a closeness to Kondou.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, she could believe that his loyalty had been genuine.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, this is not only Rudra&rsquo;s case, but also Kondou&rsquo;s regrets.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">I remember now that Kondou seemed to regret not being able to defend his country. That&rsquo;s why he worked for Rudra, no matter what he had to do, to make sure he never went through that again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all this time, Velgrynd wonders if there is anything that she can do for Kondou.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is only one answer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is only one way to get rid of Kondou&rsquo;s regrets.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that in mind, Velgrynd switches her mind to listen more intently.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknowingly, Minamoto continues to explain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The existence of an alien entity that has the ability to possess and control people was quickly communicated to the world leaders. However, the leaders who were not on the scene had no way of knowing who was actually being controlled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was suspicious of those who deviated from the norm, but it was also difficult to recall the generals who were on the ground operations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was even the possibility of going public with the truth, but that would have definitely caused a panic. There would be people who would wonder if their superiors were demons, and if that happened, even the chain of command could be destroyed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It could also lead to a domestic witch hunt. That must be stopped, so a secret investigation had been conducted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a result, they learned that unlike most monsters, these creatures were organized. Moreover, they were active behind the scenes all over the world, with a clear intention to invade.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Besides, they are strong. In our kingdom, we use a monster class ranking (Kai class)</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;to describe the strength of monsters, but even the weakest of them are equal to the top monsters. They are so formidable that even the most advanced swordsmen and martial artists can&rsquo;t stand up to them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;The six levels of the Kai class are, from the top to the bottom are: God/Buddha, Mythical/Dragon monsters, Heavenly monsters, Advanced monsters, Intermediate demons, and Lower monsters.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;The middle and lower levels are called the Chimimory&#333;</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;(Malevolent Spirits of Mountains and Rivers). The Advanced monsters to the Heavenly monsters, just before the Mythical/Dragon monsters, were called Evil Demon Rakshasa.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the weakest of the monsters that had appeared this time were of Heavenly Monster class.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kondou and his men had revealed their true identity when they attacked the enemy fleet. They were defeated by the ringleader when theey passed on this information.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kondou-san believed that David and Li Jinlong&rsquo;s &lsquo;Kai-class&rsquo; were higher than the Mythical/Dragon class. I&rsquo;m sure he was right in his assessment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because Kondou-san is one of the strongest men here in Hinomoto.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even at the time of the suicide attack, Kondou&rsquo;s skill level was top-notch. His mastery of the Kifuo-ryu style (spirit fighting style), the secret of Oboro Shinmei-ryu, enabled him to attain a high level of fighting ability at the Mythical/Dragon level. Still, the reason why he was defeated was because there were two enemies.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, that man was indeed a good one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">What?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you know Tatsuya?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, Rudra. Kondou served you in the world I came from, too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;For me? Well, Rudra, or whoeve it is, has the same soul as I do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. And Kondou fought and died proudly for you over there, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Emperor is speechless and dumbfounded. He was deeply disappointed in the death of a man who had been his loyal servant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh no, Kondou-san&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minamoto was incredulous as he muttered. Kondou was such an outstanding swordsman, and he wondered if could have been the trump card against the demons had he still been alive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that he was confronted with the fact that he was dead, he didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was hoping that Kondou was still alive, but it&rsquo;s a shame.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Master Gensei remained calm as he said this, but inwardly he struggled to hide the sadness that had arisen from the small amount of hope he had lost.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">It is out of the question to be distracted as someone in a responsible position. I have to calm myself down,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;he thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone believed Velgrynd. It was unusual, but strangely enough, they felt her words were true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd let everyone hear the story of Kondou&rsquo;s end. At the same time, she tried to figure out who the enemy was, given Kondou&rsquo;s strength.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">The only thing that matters is that Kondou could be defeated before he crossed over into the world. I think the word &ldquo;demon&rdquo; refers to the phantom race, but if that&rsquo;s the case then my enemy&mdash;no. I can&rsquo;t be too sure. I don&rsquo;t have any standards to conclude anything, so I guess I&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see for now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd was a confident being, a True Dragon at her best, but heer loss to Rimuru had made her cautious. Although she didn&rsquo;t think it was the enemy, she would reserve her judgment until she had more information.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, her guess at this point was both right and wrong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The concentration of magic is so low in this world that there is no such thing as a remarkably strong monster. It was as if they had arrived from the other world and were so fierce that they were known as gods.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even such individuals were no match for the violence of numbers, and through the cooperation of swordsmen and sorcerers, thee numbers were reduced to an almost unseen level now. That&rsquo;s why there was no magic element pooling occurring. Therefore, it was difficult for powerful monsters to occur naturally.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike Veldora, the current Velgrynd completes her own mana circulation. It does not need to be replenished from the atmosphere and does not leave her body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">This is a skill I learned when I crossed various worlds, that&rsquo;s why I was unaware the concentration of monsters and magic in this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the first place, crossing over worlds would normally be impossible. Even through the &ldquo;Underworld Gate,&rdquo; you are limited by the size of the gate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A person like Velgrynd, who can use &lsquo;Spacetime Leap&rsquo; without any restrictions, is outside the laws of the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, compared to Velgrynd&rsquo;s magic-filled homeland, the standard of strength in this world was far inferior.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That would soon be revealed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the help of the Emperor, Velgrynd was able to get a general idea of the situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This world cannot be brought back to life and will soon fall into the hands of the invaders.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The leaders of each country are aware of this fact, but they have allowed the military, which embodies the will of the people, to run amok to the point where there is no longer anything that they can do about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s going on with your enemy&rsquo;s movements?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemy coalition fleet had defeated the Imperial Navy of which Kondou belonged, but its subsequent movements are unknown. There were supposedly some remaining Imperial ships, but they had completely lost contact with them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Originally, they surrendered when their defeat was confirmed. That information should have reached the home country as well, but that is not the case.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As for our own judgement, we are guessing that they were captured by the demon. It is possible that the enemy is not bound by the rules of humanity and therefore did not allow them to surrender, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also curious about Kondou&rsquo;s words. Based on the expression that he was taken over, I wonder if the demons have a propensity to possess people. If so, the survivors are doomed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Someone was assigned to bring back information. And yet we haven&rsquo;t heard from them. That explains the situation if they were all possessed by demons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nowhere to run, on the Great South Sea. Each country has approached their fleets, but they haven&rsquo;t responded. There&rsquo;s no reason to lie here, so I think it&rsquo;s safe to assume that our forces have been taken.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s one of the possibilities, but if that&rsquo;s true, the situation was bad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even mankind&rsquo;s greatest swordsman is no match for the enemy leader. Moreover, elite soldiers could be sacrificed to the enemy monsteres. Moreover, the army won&rsquo;t be able to intercept them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was nothing they could do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Gensei and his team had decided to focus all their efforts on the defense of the Imperial Capital.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a matter of buying time. You understand that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. There&rsquo;s only one thing we can do now. I&rsquo;ve sent people we trust to find out what the enemy is doing. And then we will gather the world&rsquo;s best forces to defeat the ringleader.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a low success rate strategy, but it&rsquo;s the only way to go&hellip; If only Kondou-san could have defeated one of them, we would have been able to defeat them! Because there were two Mythical/Dragon-class players, they wouldn&rsquo;t even allow him to escape. So, if Master Araki, myself, plus Amari</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and all the other heroes from other countries teamed up, we might even be able to defeat the demon leader!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">The man named Amari Masahiko</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;was the brother of Minamoto, who was the only one to compete with Kondou. Moreover, this man had mastered not only swordsmanship but also the art of law. He excelled in espionage and still works in secret missions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, there was another strongman hidden here in Hinomoto.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although Emperor Akira never talks about it, there were other &ldquo;Emperor Guardians&rdquo; besides Gensei.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, there are also famous heroes in each country.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only those who had infiltrated the surface of society, there were also those who were in the &ldquo;Kai class&rdquo; and even higher than the Mythical/Dragon class in the underworld.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The famous ones are the aforementioned Mystery Monk Pulcinella of the north, and Fist Saint Xianhua of China. Just from the stories passed down in the Empire&rsquo;s own people, they know that these two men are extremely powerful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To confront this global threat, these heroes must work together. If they can&rsquo;t do so, they will be destroyed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that was also a pipe dream, as Akira was keenly aware.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that wasn&rsquo;t the only problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The problem is that there are more than just two ringleaders of the enemy. And, as much as I hate to think about it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You feel like there will be trouble if you go further, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To Velgrynd&rsquo;s point, Gensei nodded bitterly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to defeat the monster of the Mythical/Dragon class, he wanted to double the number of warriors of the same class or higher. But with the size of the enemy unknown, it was impossible for the heroes of the world to assemble together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Empire, too, must protect its own dignitaries as the first priority.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problems kept piling up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be best if they could lure the monsters of the mythical/dragon class individually. Even if that was not possible, they still have to fight only the number of monsters they can win against. If they were outnumbered, then they would be defeated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this is when things changed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei was puzzled, but Velgrynd helped him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, you&rsquo;ve got problems. Okay. I&rsquo;ll help you, so show me what you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know your enemy, you can&rsquo;t make a plan. In order to do that, I need to know how strong these demons are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple. You said it yourself Gensei, if you are Kondou&rsquo;s master, then you must be more than equal in strength, right? I&rsquo;m new to this world, so I don&rsquo;t know what the standard of strength is. As such, you&rsquo;re going to have to&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see, I understand. Kondou and I are both better at this level of skill. I have profound secrets that I have yet to show you, and I have supreme secrets that should only be told to the head family. However, that man&rsquo;s conviction was admirable. His spirit was fierce and his determination to win was extraordinary. You must leave it to chance if you are serious about this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In short, it&rsquo;s an even match.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A little difference is an error for Velgrynd. It was good enough for the standard though, so she decided to try it out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The location has changed&hellip;It&rsquo;s the training grounds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei excused Minamoto from the room because he couldn&rsquo;t show his supreme inner secrets to him, so no one but the Emperor is here to witness the event.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd remains poised and stares blankly at Gensei.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei shows slight hesitation, his favorite sword in hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The silken robe doesn&rsquo;t impede her movements, but it is unsuitable for combat by all accounts. And it wasn&rsquo;t likely to have much defense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Gensei were to make a serious move, it would be a deadly one. He was unlikely to win against the Velgrynd, but he thought it might hurt her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei decided to ask Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want to ask you one question. I know this is rude, but are you sure you&rsquo;re serious? You may not be safe when you&rsquo;re dealing with the inner workings of our school.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd understands that this is a question out of concern to her. She could have ignored it, but decided to reassure Gensei.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is also a speculation that that person will be able to demonstrate his abilities.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice of you. But don&rsquo;t be alarmed. Your weapon, the sword? It looks pretty old and good quality, but I&rsquo;m afraid it doesn&rsquo;t work for me. So, don&rsquo;t worry about it, just come at me and give it your best shot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Gensei&rsquo;s sword was only less than unique-grade in performance. In this world where magic was weak, swords could not evolve.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Gensei responded to Velgrynd&rsquo;s challenge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Concentrating his explosive fighting spirit, he unleashed the supreme profound effect of Oboro Shinmei-ry&#363;, the Eightfold Sakura&mdash;the Eightfold Flower Flash.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But alas, the flower did not bloom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The great technique was stopped by the tips of Velgrynd&rsquo;s fingers.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.67px; height: 1128.80px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 793.67px; height: 1128.80px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A shapeshifting sword streak, but not a split. Even if it was too fast for an ordinary person to catch, it was too slow for Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re serious about that, that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kuh, I&rsquo;m here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was too late to put it to rest with words like &ldquo;ability gap&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was an insurmountable gap between Gensei and Velgrynd, between heaven and earth, or even more so. This result made it clear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, in exchange for Gensei&rsquo;s disappointment, Velgrynd had obtained the correct information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei&rsquo;s Eight Flowers, an art that had been passed down only to the original family, had never been taught to Kondou.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no doubt that it is the greatest and most powerful weapon in this world. Therefore, it was thought that just by looking at the amount of power it possessed, it could surpass the Mythical/Dragon class and even reach the divine God/Buddha class.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you really a god?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Although it was my brother who created the world, he&rsquo;s not a god.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&hellip;in our perception, we call it a god.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The concept of God is one that is perceived differently at different times and places. I don&rsquo;t care what you think, but you have to remember that there are some beings that can destroy me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd was reminded of a laid-back slime.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s annoying to think that she lost to that thing, but there&rsquo;s no doubt in heer mind that she wouldn&rsquo;t win another fight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">That doesn&rsquo;t make Rimuru a god, does it? I guess the bottom line is that his category doesn&rsquo;t exist, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then Velgrynd thought about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Honestly, thinking about it won&rsquo;t give her an answer, so she switched her thinking immediately.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What&rsquo;s important is the enemy of this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s about the demon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, thank you for your help. This made me realize how immature and small I am. I&rsquo;ll use this experience as an inspiration to work harder in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei just shrugs off such comments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Velgrynd quickly put together a theory.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei and Kondou are roughly equal. However, his strength was far less powerful than Kondou&rsquo;s was when they first met.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most of the humans in the material world die from the dense concentrations of magical elements once they cross the world. But a few were reborn by remodeling, transforming their bodies into powerful beings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These were the &lsquo;otherworlders&rsquo; of Velgrynd&rsquo;s homeland.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;ve forgotten. This world is very low in magic. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s harder to cast a spell, and the level physical strengthening is low. Their physical strength is innate, so it&rsquo;s rather amazing that they can even be this powerful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so Velgrynd made her decision, remembering the shock she felt in her fingertips.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back home, it was as powerful as a rank A. She was impressed by what he can do with a rare-grade weapon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now then, you can imagine the strength of the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">I guess the demon class is about B rank to A-minus rank. The Mythical/Dragon rank is about A-minus rank. If so, the demon must be a &ldquo;phantom-race&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The phantom-race is an Aggressor tribe, a half-mental life form. In the material world, it could only be active for a short time without incarnation. Particularly in this world where magic is scarce, its energy efficiency would have been too low if it had not possessed a human.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, if it uses its true strength, its human body would not be able to withstand it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">He&rsquo;s getting weaker. Well, this world isn&rsquo;t protected by magical elements, so if you use too much power, it might destroy it. If they&rsquo;re destroying it, or even invading it, do they control its power? That&rsquo;s probably why Kondou&rsquo;s current strength was so important in a fight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the phantom-race is serious, then the inhabitants of this world don&rsquo;t stand a chance. Velgrynd concluded and smiled at her good fortune to be here now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd was confident that with her, they could better manage to deal with the demon king Feldway, the leader of the phantom race. However, it was unlikely that Feldway would be sent to this invading region, so that concern was unnecessary.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, it was just as Velgrynd had predicted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The men who were invading this world were an advance force of monsters under Cornu&rsquo;s command.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also, the size of the Underworld Gate that spontaneously appeared in this world was so small that it was impossible for Cornu&rsquo;s main body to appear. It was currently in the process of expansion, giving them a little more time to take over the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She hadn&rsquo;t been able to see that accurately, but it was enough for Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei appears to be maintaining a sense of normalcy, but he is actually depressed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naturally.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was as if his swordplay, which he believed to be the strongest, was completely useless against Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even his secret techniques couldn&rsquo;t reach her. Even though he understood that they were on different levels, it was difficult to convince his emotions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, Gensei used his well-honed mental strength to keep his mind from being disturbed. Velgrynd smiles at Gensei.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You should be proud of yourself. In a world where there is little to no magic, few people can reach that level of strength. If you could have taken in some magic element and sublimated your body, you could have become not only an Immortal but a Saint. It&rsquo;s too bad about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A Saint, that&rsquo;s a far cry for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not really, but yes. I&rsquo;m going to reward you for helping me. Can you accept it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A reward?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. If you want, I&rsquo;ll reforge your sword with my power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd smiles at that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She could use &lsquo;Matter Creation&rsquo; to create a mythical-grade weapon. In this case, she had poured magic into Gensei&rsquo;s sword, hoping to encourage its evolution.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is it possible?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei was confused, but then reminded himself that it was too late.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei was convinced that the Velgrynd was a heavenly being beyond his comprehension, and that if she said she could do it, then she could do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">An ancestral heirloom&hellip;it would be fun to trust Velgrynd-dono with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that resolve, Gensei bowed to Velgrynd and held out his beloved sword.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, let me take care of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd nodded widely and accepted the sword.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Normally, she would casually create a blue dragon sword, but this time was different. Carefully, she assessed the composition of the sword and poured her magical elements into it, making delicate adjustments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd&rsquo;s work continues with a more serious expression than the one she had in battle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, about thirty minutes passed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With an old blacksmith&rsquo;s skillful technique and the magic that Velgrynd controlled completely, together, they gave the sword a mythical glow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Finished.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a weapon evolution that would normally take hundreds to thousands of years, but in such a short time, Velgrynd had forged Gensei&rsquo;s beloved sword into a mythical-grade sword.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Th-This is!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is the best weapon in the world now, isn&rsquo;t it? Even so, you can&rsquo;t possibly use it right now&hellip;Still, the sword has a will. If the sword approves, it will help you a bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that will be you, or one of your descendants,&rdquo; Velgrynd laughed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The smile was so beautiful that it bewitched Gensei&rsquo;s heart.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The time was now evening.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was time to eat, so Akira went back to his room.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd was also invited to join. Since she was here, she decided to join.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The maids of the palace are handpicked from a carefully selected group. They are well-trained and unaffected by anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They prepared the meal as if it were a matter of course, without batting an eyelash at the sight of the Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minamoto is on guard duty outside the door, while Gensei stands behind Akira Sakura and waits. Only the two of them will take their seats.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, what do you plan to do now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will be by your side, and I&rsquo;ll protect you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that, but can I assume that you&rsquo;ll be on my side?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd smiles in reply and is happy just to be by Rudra&rsquo;s side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Confused by this Velgrynd, Akira Sakura asks</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huhu, then you will eliminate conflict from this world and reassure me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, that was a joke. And yet Velgrynd laughed and replied.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you want, I can give you this world. We&rsquo;ll wipe out the countries you don&rsquo;t want and silence the ones who complain. But first, we have to destroy the demons that are in our way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone in the room was stunned to see Velgrynd answer with a very innocent smile. Even the maidservant who was on duty unintentionally spilled some of the soup.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They all knew in their guts that she meant what she said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s true, or that it&rsquo;s a big deal. The words would be laughed off if someone else had said them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there was something about Velgrynd that made it so.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Gensei and others who know the essence of Velgrynd know it&rsquo;s not a joke and that it&rsquo;s possible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same was true for Akira Sakura.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, I haven&rsquo;t laughed this hard in a long time. You&rsquo;ve done well to joke around so much that the maidservants take you seriously. Your joke was amusing, but I&rsquo;ll just take it as a compliment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They managed to cover up the situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was clear now that Velgrynd was not an ordinary being, as the conversation at dinner made clear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only is she strong, but her train of thought is tricky.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Akira finally understood that she would do anything for him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If she was ordered to destroy another country, Velgrynd would do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To her, right and wrong were of secondary importance, and only Sakura&rsquo;s will was what mattered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be honest, this was the first time in his life that Akira was so confused.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had been born as the next Emperor of the Empire and had lived a life of ease. But he didn&rsquo;t have freedom either, he was taught from an early age that it was the duty of a king.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had everything he needed, but he had to give up what he really wanted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Love was an illusion and he had the duke&rsquo;s daughter as his wife to back him up. It was like a contract and he couldn&rsquo;t refuse her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The wise Akira knew it before he became a young man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Transience is the truth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The world is like a dream.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because it is fleeting, you can strive to make your dreams come true with all your might.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, it is beautiful to surrender to fate and accumulate the small amount of happiness that exists in those days.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the latter that Akira Sakura chose. To do what you love is a luxury that never comes true, even for the Emperor who has everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was precisely because of such an Akira, that Velgrynd was a surprise to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That freedom will not be bound by any man. And yet she is beholden to only one person, Akira.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A strange woman. No, a goddess. Even if he was acting as Rudra, a simple favor is always better than a simple one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feeling this way, Akira Sakura enjoyed a peaceful dinner for the first time in a long time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is now next morning after dawn.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Today there will be a meeting by the Imperial Headquarters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The issue here is how to handle Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Akira declared, acting like a lover in front of a third party is strictly forbidden.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it was necessary to figure out how to explain Velgrynd&rsquo;s status first.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then there was the question of clothing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Exotic clothing is out of the question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One had to dress appropriately for their status.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While all the best maids gathered to arrange the various costumes, Akira Sakura, with input from Gensei and Minamoto, pondered the question of Velgrynd&rsquo;s status.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As for the maid&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A lady-in-waiting can&rsquo;t attend a meeting, you fool.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minamoto&rsquo;s idea is dismissed by Gensei before he can finish.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The escort is going to be difficult too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your Majesty, I&rsquo;ve considered that, but Velgrynd-dono&rsquo;s appearance is too eye-catching. By all appearances, she is a foreigner, so she will be suspected of being a spy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If she was Japanese, they wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about it so much. But Velgrynd was too beautiful and seemingly of northern European descent to stand out in this country.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if he wants to introduce her as a bodyguard or a spy, they&rsquo;d be asked why they are using foreigners so heavily. That said, Velgrynd won&rsquo;t be happy if he asks her to stay at home.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, it was a shame to let Velgrynd&rsquo;s forces go to waste when she was supposed to be on their side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just when he was wondering what to do, Velgrynd herself voiced her opinion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped. I don&rsquo;t really like it, and I don&rsquo;t want to, but I&rsquo;m going to change my look. Is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And with that, Velgrynd&rsquo;s appearance changes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dark hair and dark eyes. Her skin had become a pale yellow with just a hint of red.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1128.82px;"><img alt="IMAGE VELGRYND UNDERCOVER" src="images/image16.jpg" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1128.82px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow, you can even do tricks like that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minamoto was impressed with the tone of voice that was unexpected, and Gensei agreed that it wasn&rsquo;t that strange.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I guess I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Akira Sakura was slightly distracted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just by changing the arrangement of the coloring, the impression was very different. Although this still made her look less Japanese, it was not too much of a distraction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">The uniform given to Velgrynd was the same as Gensei&rsquo;s. In order to attend the meeting, Akira Sakura had assigned her &ldquo;Personal Guard.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incidentally, the Emperor&rsquo;s Guard consists of three organizations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first is the Imperial Guard Swordsman Corps.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the only unit in the palace that is allowed to be armed. However, only the captain, Minamoto, is allowed to enter the Emperor&rsquo;s quarters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second is the Imperial Palace Guards.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This unit magically protected the Emperor from magic and witchcraft. They maintained a spiritual guardian barrier and were inferior to the swordsmen in terms of individual combat ability alone. Only the captain has access to the Emperor, but he has been so busy defending the capital that he hasn&rsquo;t been seen in the past few days.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the last organization was the Personal Guard, an individual group called the &quot;Emperor&rsquo;s Guardians.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not all of them, like Gensei, were well known to the public.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were those who lurked in the shadows, warding off evil.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who had harbored supernatural powers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who have split from the imperial family so that they can play the part of the Emperor&rsquo;s shadow warriors.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These men of many purposes served in the shadows, guarding the Emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No wonder no one knew who they were. So now Akira decided to give Velgrynd a position as &ldquo;Personal Guard&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Velgrynd, I will appoint you as a &ldquo;Guardian of the Emperor.&rdquo; With that title, it shall spare you the trouble of explaining to the others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I accept. Then I will behave like a proper vassal in front of the others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd, who wore a military uniform, replied flirtatiously.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone was worried about the situation, but there was no other plan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if something went wrong, it was nothing compared to the invaders, the demons. Under this judgment, preparations were being made.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One by one, people began to gather in the main conference hall. Akira was watching them from the waiting room.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Imperial Headquarters is the supreme commanding body that reports directly to Emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the army of the Emperor and is composed of both a Navy and an Army.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the top of both camps are the Minister of the Navy and the Minister of the Army.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both ministers were required to attend the Imperial General Meeting. Substitutes are allowed, but they are rarely present as it is considered a disrespect for the Emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As is customary in the past few days, most of the contents of the meeting are now reported.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the Great South Sea, the Imperial Navy was soundly defeated at sea. Even the whereabouts of survivors are unknown, and each camp is pulling out all the stops to investigate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The army, however, seemed to be someone else&rsquo;s problem. They make excuses because they don&rsquo;t have the means to go to the sea, but Akira Sakura thinks that&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t really understand the threat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">You idiots. Now is not the time for our people to be competing with each other for credit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the Emperor is someone who cannot say that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because his authority is too great, his words are too heavy. If it was in private that would be one thing, but in public, he has to be careful of what he says.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unaware of Akira Sakura&rsquo;s anguish, an officer in the army calls out,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you!? Who do you think you are!? This sacred headquarters is an outrageous place for a woman to enter!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, so I knew it was going to be like that&hellip;&rdquo; said Sakura Akira.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those whose only have inflated pride are bothered by hierarchy and etiquette. So it was natural for this to happen, but if Akira Sakura had accompanied here, there would be more of a fuss. Since they all agreed on this, Gensei was given the responsibility for Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">As I suspected, a man with a lot of blood on his hands is making things difficult. If he should offend her, he would not only destroy himself, but this city as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Letting out a big sigh, Akira Sakura let out a big sigh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps it was the fate of those with Rudra&rsquo;s soul to be pushed around by Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Could you be talking to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you even understand that, you fool!? This is why&mdash;Mogaa!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the officer&rsquo;s ranting stopped.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was because Velgrynd had grabbed the man&rsquo;s chest in an unnoticeable move and plunged her pistol into his open mouth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a thin smile, Velgrynd says</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would have mattered whether you were a man or a woman in this day and age, when you could kill someone by pulling the trigger, if you fought with a sword or a spear in the olden days. What is important in today&rsquo;s warfare is the ability to analyze the situation and to make a calm and rational decision without emotion. You don&rsquo;t deserve to be here. I wonder if you are not qualified to be here, screaming like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To begin with, he was no match for force, but seeing the violence of a gun, which anyone can understand, caused a commotion among the people in the hall.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Keh, you! Let go of the Chief of Staff!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have guns in here! Guards, someone call the guards!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd laughs mockingly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Silly you, fussing over a single toy! How can you be considered a glorious soldier of the Empire for that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Many faces turned red when they heard that, and many people looked at her angrily.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Regardless, Velgrynd shoved the chief of staff aside. Then she pointed her toy gun and pulled the trigger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A stream of water spurted out, wetting the Chief of Staff&rsquo;s crotch.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ufufu. It looks like you just wet your pants. Why don&rsquo;t you go home and change?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;You, you&hellip;</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was shaking with humiliation, but as soon as he looked into Velgrynd&rsquo;s eyes, he gulped down his words.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a horrifying stare.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I will kill you if you make any more noise unceremoniously&hellip;&rsquo; the Chief of Staff felt as if he was being told that, and all at once the blood drained from his veins.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, excuse me. I guess I got a little too excited myself. I do miss the water pistol. I felt like a child again, and my head was cold.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s good to hear. If you&rsquo;re going to be in the meeting, you&rsquo;re going to have to behave yourself a little better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Chief of Staff nodded coyly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was short-tempered and a bit arrogant, but he was no fool. He had failed in their first encounter, but he hadn&rsquo;t made a mistake in his subsequent responses. If he had still growled at her, he would have had a heart attack from Velgrynd&rsquo;s fury.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rudra is the only thing that matters to Velgrynd. She was not amused by the idea of an incompetent man serving Rudra.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So she tried to get rid of the incompetence, but she was just a little pending on the Chief of Staff&rsquo;s punishment. Just because he was short-tempered and misogynistic was not enough of a reason to eliminate him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Phew, I&rsquo;m getting nicer. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been through so much on this trip.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so on and so forth, Velgrynd praises herself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Needless to say, it was an overestimate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was just happy that Rudra is with her, otherwise the result would have been different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Each time she leapt for the pieces of his soul, there were times when she couldn&rsquo;t find her next goal. In such cases, she had to wait for the reincarnation of Rudra to be born, which could take years or decades.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Velgrynd, that time after seeing her loved ones off was like torture. In her own mind, a man&rsquo;s fate was sealed if he came under her influence at such a time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Chief of Staff had been lucky.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the scene had calmed down, the naval minister spoke up to change things up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, Araki-dono. And who is this woman?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The naval general looks at Gensei with a commanding gaze. He&rsquo;s in his fifties.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei also got in a word.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Excuse me, I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m late in the introductions. She is a colleague of mine, and it has been decided that she will attend the Imperial Council meeting today, by permission of His Majesty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My name is &lsquo;Ryuo.&rsquo; Please to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Interrupting Gensei&rsquo;s introduction, Velgrynd nonchalantly took a false name. The name was a random combination of the character for dragon from &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo; and the character for phoenix from the divine beast that controlled the flame in this world&mdash;Ryuo (the phoenix).</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, that was a big problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, phoenix for dragon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Taking a dragon for a name is insolent. This is really insulting to the Emperor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Or are you related to Your Majesty by any chance?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They had calmed down now but there was now a great deal of confusion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei regrets his mistake.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Did she do this on purpose? No, no. Velgrynd-dono doesn&rsquo;t care what we do. Since she even disguised herself, we should have considered a pseudonym&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was his fault, Gensei reflected.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Akira also let out a sigh in the other room.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve lived a long time, but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve been pushed around this much. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m somewhat amused.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Akira stood up and stepped into the chamber.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is a critical time. Isn&rsquo;t it strange to be disclosing our hand?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He chuckled as he said this before those who noticed him stood up and hung their heads.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that the lord had told them so, they have no choice but to accept it. Even if they had a complaint, they could not say it openly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Velgrynd in this world came to be known as Ryuo.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get started.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a word from Akira Sakura, the main conference began.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then I will give the report.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That said, it was a naval intelligence officer who stood up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The last few days had been pretty much the same, but today was different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The enemy coalition fleet has made a port call at Atlantis.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, sir.

But how can you be sure it&rsquo;s not a deception?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As you say. There are several archipelagos in the Great South Sea. There was also a report that Azalea is setting up a secret base there. Have you sent agents there as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The general asks, and the Minister of the Navy follows suit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The intelligence officer answers those questions without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There are too many of them to reach all the islands, sir. However, the number of enemy ships remaining in port at Atlantis matches the information we received prior to our sortie, and the possibility of a separate fleet has been eliminated. An Imperial Navy warship has been captured. They&rsquo;re planning to stay here and work on their maintenance, to frustrate our will to fight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Imperial Navy&rsquo;s crushing defeat was already known to the Imperial Headquarters. So no one is surprised now, but they can&rsquo;t keep quiet when they hear that their ship has been captured.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The enemy&rsquo;s movements were superimposed. And, um, have any of our ships succeeded in escaping?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, of course not. If there was, they would have contacted us long ago.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The surprisingly brazen Chief of Staff pointed out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seems to have cooled off, as he said he would, and his point is accurate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As you say, Mr. Chief of Staff, I believe it is safe to assume that every ship in our fleet has been captured.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tch! Then it&rsquo;s as if we&rsquo;ve already increased the enemy&rsquo;s strength!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped. We were dealing with an unknown enemy, a demon. Even if it were me in the room, the result would have been the same.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Chief refutes the Army Minister&rsquo;s statement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Excuse me. I didn&rsquo;t mean to insult the Navy. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m frustrated&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I accept your apology. We all have the same regrets.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The meeting was tense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are in the tightest situation since the beginning of the Empire&rsquo;s history.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Imperial Fleet, which had prided itself on being the strongest in the world, had been defeated. Moreover, many ships, including the most advanced ones, have fallen into the hands of the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone was anxious and worried about the unprecedented danger. There was no point in complaining, but even a whine would still pop out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the commander-in-chief hadn&rsquo;t acted like a grown-up, the situation would have been even bleaker.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a slightly relaxed atmosphere, Akira Sakura, not missing the opportunity, opens his mouth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, are our soldiers still being held as prisoners of war?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That question makes the naval participants tense. The safety of their comrades, their loved ones, is a cause for concern. Of course, they were important to the army as well, a matter of great importance to their comrades and also of great consequence to their future plans.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If this were a normal war, the wartime agreement would have guaranteed the safety of the prisoners of war. But this time, that premise could be undermined by the involvement of an unknown invader.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it was the same as before, fine.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His gaze fell on the intelligence officer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Get on with your answer!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The stagnant intelligence officer stammered, but was urged by his superior officer to continue.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;According to eyewitness reports, a group of Imperial Navy generals were steering the captured vessel with their own hands. There were also enemy soldiers on board, but they were in very small numbers. There was no sign of gunfire, and it appeared as if they had turned over of their own volition.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was natural to stammer, everyone thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the same was true of Akira. A proud soldier of the Imperial Guard would never abandon his duties so easily. And moreover, it was unthinkable that he would turn over to the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t make Kondou-san, who risked his life for it, any happier&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minamoto&rsquo;s murmurings echoed through the silent chamber.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;It is better to believe in the possibility of being controlled by a demon.&rsquo; That is the true feelings of everyone present.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Velgrynd cheerfully affirms that thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmmm, silly. Don&rsquo;t worry. None of your friends are going to betray you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The naval officers could not believe that their comrades had betrayed them, and they were puzzled by the circumstantial evidence that suggested it. That&rsquo;s why they found hope in Velgrynd&rsquo;s statement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you mean by that, Ryuo-dono?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Minister of the Navy asks on behalf of everyone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd smiled and replied.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple. Demons have the ability to possess people. They&rsquo;re new and don&rsquo;t have much power in our world, but by possessing people and taking their bodies, they can slowly become more and more powerful. They don&rsquo;t have much magic element as a source of power, and it will take some time for them to fully assimilate, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was exactly the hope.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. So they&rsquo;re being controlled after all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If it takes so long to assimilate, does that mean we can help them now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t allow them to mock our friends! We will destroy you, demons!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We must immediately launch a rescue mission&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait a minute, things aren&rsquo;t that easy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The chamber was in an uproar.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some wondered how she knew so much about it, but then they reminded themselves that it was no surprise when she was Emperor&rsquo;s trump card, and they accepted her word with open arms.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then they all agreed on rescuing their comrades, but then they remembered that it was a conundrum and regained their composure.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To begin with, the empire has just lost the war for its own survival. A rescue mission is not something that comes easily to mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First of all, there weren&rsquo;t enough ships left in the kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Six aircraft carriers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Four battleships.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Four heavy cruiser ships.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two light cruiser ships.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eighteen destroyer ships.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After losing so many ships, even if they could gather them from all over the Empire, they could only gather less than half of these ships.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They would only need to assemble a single fleet. If they were sent to rescue everyone, then the defense of the mainland would become a challenge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;But the world&rsquo;s leaders are aware of the current situation. Shouldn&rsquo;t we make peace in secret and concentrate on the true enemy, the demons</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Everyone knows that. This is impossible with the army in its grasp.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Other countries are not happy, but they are the same as us. We have not been able to keep track of the army troops we have sent to China.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And more importantly, we&rsquo;ve just been robbed of our decisive force&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if the leadership had made peace, it wouldn&rsquo;t have solved anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no way to announce an end to the war if the military is still out of control. Therefore, the first step in resolving the situation is to deal with the demon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before that, there was a concern that everyone was aware of, but couldn&rsquo;t say anything about.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What was it?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is there anyone here in possession of the demon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the Minister of War who finally uttered it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the way he stared at the naval participants, it was obvious what he was thinking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh! Do you doubt us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what I said. But from what you&rsquo;ve just told me, I&rsquo;m sure you can&rsquo;t blame me for suspecting it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous! If you say that, then so does the army, they&rsquo;re running amok in China!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nuh-uh, that&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The atmosphere in the chamber was almost engulfed in a terrible atmosphere, but it was interrupted by Akira Sakura.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The good news is that our brave soldiers are safe. It is only natural that we should rescue them, but can we really achieve this by squabbling here? I&rsquo;m sure you know the right answer, brave men.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&ldquo;Yes, Your Majesty! I beg your pardon!&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With those words, everyone became calm.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a very dignified thing to say, but for Akira, he still felt like he was walking a tightrope.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Simply being upset won&rsquo;t solve the situation, so there is no choice here but to strongly rebuke. He can understand the anxiety of the officers, but Akira Sakura also felt frustrated at his inability to do anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ryuo-dono, I understand the War Minister&rsquo;s concern, but are you able to distinguish between humans and demons?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Gensei who asked this question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they couldn&rsquo;t tell friend from foe apart, then they couldn&rsquo;t talk about anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s the premise for all of their countermeasures.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was quiet again in the chamber as everyone waited for Velgrynd&rsquo;s answer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way any of them are. If there were, I would have told you first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone was relieved to hear that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same was true for Gensei.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If a demon of the heavenly demon class had transformed into a human being, there was a chance they couldn&rsquo;t tell them apart. If even Velgrynd here couldn&rsquo;t do it, then there would have been nothing left to do but give up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;There was still hope,&rsquo; Gensei felt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Velgrynd was different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised. Can&rsquo;t you even tell if you&rsquo;re one of them or not? Demons, I call them phantoms, but they possess people because they have to. So that they can live in this world. And once they&rsquo;ve fully assimilated, they can no longer be considered human.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If assimilation isn&rsquo;t complete, the &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; guarding this imperial city should be enough to see through it. They may be able to transform into humans, but their very nature is foreign.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s because of such instability that they won&rsquo;t go out until stable, Velgrynd explained.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And you see, the lowest-ranking &lsquo;grunts&rsquo; are wise, but not self-aware. They&rsquo;re small fry who follow orders from their superiors, so you can figure them out with a quick questioning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The memory of a possessed person can be read, but it is only the surface level. If you ask about the deeper parts, they will not be able to answer and will get messed up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Velgrynd explained this, the mood in the chamber was one of relief.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The explanation continued further.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was until this time that the meeting was serious.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From this point forward, Velgrynd was on her own.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Since you don&rsquo;t seem to know anything about it, I have to tell you that there is a definite hierarchy of ranks among the phantoms. That &lsquo;soldier&rsquo; you just mentioned is a small fry. And since they&rsquo;re only one level of strength away from being fully assimilated, they&rsquo;re only as strong as the most advanced demon (youkai).&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s easy to say that it&rsquo;s a advanced demon, but it&rsquo;s a level of danger that requires a task force. However, the Velgrynd could not care less.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;R-Ryuo-dono, does that mean that if they fully assimilate, this &lsquo;soldier&rsquo; will become a heavenly-class demon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Minister of the Army asked, to which Velgrynd replied firmly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Clever man, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Army Minister&rsquo;s exclamation wasn&rsquo;t because he felt ridiculed. He was speechless at the desperate situation of the lowest-ranked soldiers being the equivalent of the Heavenly Demon class.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The temperature difference between him and Velgrynd was so great that it was pitiful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no one here who could laugh at the Army Minister. They all felt the same way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why are you surprised? If that was the case, even Gensei can beat it. If you&#39;re a&quot; commander &quot;class who commands a group of soldiers, they may have a hard time, but they can&#39;t beat him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The lower-ranked &ldquo;commander&rdquo; class is equivalent to the A rank in strength in the other world&mdash;but until their possession is complete, they are only slightly stronger than the B rank.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once it was fully assimilated into the mythical/dragon class, it would be an inevitable struggle. But even so, Velgrynd decided that Gensei would be enough to defeat it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It pains me to say this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but against two of them, even Kondou lost. I don&rsquo;t want you to get your hopes up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be so weak. Kondou stuck to his beliefs until the end, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That reminds Gensei.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He realized that he had been weak.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, he realized how blind he had been. He could feel the heat of the sword at his side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That primed Gensei to regain his confidence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. If we act weak, we will lose battles that could have been won.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right. Well, if you&rsquo;re feeling weak, I&rsquo;m here, so there&rsquo;s no way you can lose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Velgrynd who ruined Gensei&rsquo;s resolve.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that, the flow of the main conference has changed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd&rsquo;s explanation continued.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The higher up they are, the stronger they are, but their energy is too high for them to come into our world. Maybe they&rsquo;re only here now up to the lower echelon, the &lsquo;general&rsquo; level. So&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, wait, wait!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The explanation was interrupted, and Velgrynd grimaced. Had it not been in front of Akira Sakura, she wouldn&rsquo;t have forgiven anyone for interrupting her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, the ranks of the phantom, are we to assume that they are the same as those of the military?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you doubting my language skills?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mean to, but it does raise the question of whether there is a &lsquo;lieutenant&rsquo; or &lsquo;colonel&rsquo; rank between &lsquo;commander&rsquo; and &lsquo;general&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the Minister of the Navy who heard about it, but this was on everyone&rsquo;s mind as well. It may be insignificant to Velgrynd, but to the inhabitants of this world, they are a desperate opponent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If Gensei-dono is going to have a hard time, would the &lsquo;commander&rsquo; class be the equivalent of a mythical/dragon demon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I think that&rsquo;s the same opponent that Kondou lost to, so it&rsquo;s almost certainly true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then how strong is a &lsquo;general&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s as strong as a mythical/dragon class or even a god/buddha class.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since it cannot be beat by humans, it is classified as a god/buddha class. If such an opponent attacked, any resistance was meaningless.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One by one, their faces grew pale as they realized this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So perhaps Kondou had been defeated by this &lsquo;general.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Maybe so, but I&rsquo;m not interested. I don&rsquo;t care either way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It doesn&rsquo;t matter who you lose to, Velgrynd doesn&rsquo;t care.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All that mattered was the fact that you had lost.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh yeah, and since I remember, I should tell you that there are only two ways for a phantom to appear in this world. Either you go through the Underworld Gate, or you&rsquo;re summoned by a superior. I&rsquo;m guessing he was summoned because there would be no &lsquo;gate&rsquo; at sea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The General could have called in more than 10,000 of them,&rdquo; Velgrynd said in a light-hearted tone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To the listeners&rsquo; point of view, it was a hopeless number.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone could only stare at the Velgrynd in awe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Would Ryuo-dono, I mean, can you win?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;That was the only hope,&rsquo; the Minister of the Navy asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a ridiculous question,&rsquo; he thought to himself and started laughing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even against an enemy general-level unit, this enemy would be powerful enough to destroy mankind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now that it leads its subordinates, there is nothing they can do about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how strong the mysterious woman who called herself Ryuo was, there was no way she could take on the Legion individually.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the opponent an army of god class with unimaginable power? In all times and places, we have only heard of stories of man&rsquo;s victory over the gods in myths&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there no choice but to pray that the world will not be destroyed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Chief of Staff and the Army Minister felt the same way as the Navy Minister, and so they followed suit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd snickered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Silly you. If anyone could beat me, it would be only Feldway, the king of the phantoms, wouldn&rsquo;t it? But I don&rsquo;t intend to lose, and he won&rsquo;t be able to manifest himself over here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why do you know the name of the enemy king&mdash;and so many other questions. But no one was there to point them out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It occurred to them that this woman should be no different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was one thing they had to make sure of.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt that you are strong, Ryuo-sama. So I would like to ask you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the inspectorate general of education who had been silent the whole time and had watched the proceedings with great courage. He was one of the three Secretaries of the Army and a mediator in the event of a conflict.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd turned to the inspectorate general.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This country is on the verge of extinction, so will you then go out and take on the enemy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I will not. Because I have only one life left.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, that was a lie.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With her &lsquo;Parallel Existence,&rsquo; it is possible to defeat the ene y while protecting the Emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there&rsquo;s no reason to tell them that. Velgrynd used her identity as the &lsquo;Guardian of the Emperor&rsquo; as a shield and declared that she would devote herself to his protection.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For one reason only.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a calculated decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One cannot grow further if they only look to others for help in times of trouble. She doesn&rsquo;t think a country like that would have a future anyway.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that was the case, then it would be the same even if everyone died here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd is affectionate and has not yet abandoned this country, or mankind. If this were Velzard, she would not have let those with such a feeble mind live.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before she set out on her journey, she would have thought that she would take care of everything until Rudra died, but anything after that was of no concern to Velgrynd. But now she can see the bigger picture. This, too, was a change that came about because of her encounter with Rimuru and his perspective.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All that mattered to Velgrynd now was Rudra and his beloved people. And to protect the bloodline that goes on and on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why, as always, she makes sure that the people left behind will be able to do something when she&rsquo;s gone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The &nbsp;words are harsh, but Velgrynd declares that she will not move out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t worry. Your Majesty will be safe with me. So I suggest you do the best you can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In short, it was a matter of showing some guts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that the strength of the enemy is known, the direction of the Congress will be shifted to future measures.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Velgrynd&rsquo;s help, the Emperor&rsquo;s safety was assured.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The officers in the main camp are not stupid and they understand what Velgrynd is saying. That&rsquo;s why they decided to take care of it themselves first.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then keep a strict eye on the movements of the enemy fleet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, sir. I&rsquo;ll double and triple my hands and give orders not to miss the movement.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How much time do we have before the demon possesses a person and completely assimilates with them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, if there are a lot of demons, it won&rsquo;t take more than a week, but over here, I think it&rsquo;ll take at least two months.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In front of Rudra, Velgrynd also answers honestly without hiding what is asked. As a result, the policy was set without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It will take at least a month for the enemy fleet to finish replenishment and maintenance and leave port. The timing is consistent, so can we assume that the enemy won&rsquo;t move until a month from now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that. It may take some time to re-organize our freshly captured fleet, but with both the Azalea and Chinese fleets now in operation, wouldn&rsquo;t it be possible to launch them with just a refueling run?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then it would be less than two weeks from Atlantis to the Empire. It&rsquo;ll depend on the weather, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be done. Weather control is so basic, so think of it as sailing at maximum ship speed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh&hellip; yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By this time, the officers had begun to grasp Velgrynd&rsquo;s personality.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although she had an arrogant attitude, she had a surprisingly caring side to her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She answers questions seriously and will give advice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s a great ally.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If there is no way to take advantage of it, the talented ones will ask questions everywhere. And as a result, they had developed a general plan of attack.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh. We could intercept them on the mainland, but that would make it impossible for us to rescue our brave brothers and sisters who are being held captive. Perhaps we should strike out and destroy the enemy ringleaders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I agree with you, but there is the question of who should go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If Ryuo-dono is protecting His Majesty, there will be no hindsight. I&rsquo;ll come with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, if Araki-dono will join us, it&rsquo;s a good thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The entire swordsmanship squad, please join us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Minamoto-kun, I&rsquo;m counting on you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so it seemed that the conversation was settled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s when Velgrynd interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;Are you guys serious? Or are you just having suicidal thoughts?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Army Minister looked at Velgrynd with a shine in his eye.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had hoped that maybe she would join them, but that was too sweet an idea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you credit for showing that you are willing to work hard on your own, but that&rsquo;s not enough. The enemy is powerful, so we have make sure to do our best.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most of them thought, &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; but some of them figured out the answer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of them was the army&rsquo;s Chief of Staff.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Am I to understand that we need more than our own country?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was surprising to Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had been the first one to turn on her, so she was under the impression he was more impulsive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Good thing I didn&rsquo;t give up on him too soon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd nodded, disguising her true feelings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is true that this is not the time to see this global crisis as an opportunity for nations to fight each other. We understand that, but as I have just explained, our military is in overdrive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The army chief of staff says that he is frustrated too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then Minamoto says,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As I thought, we should also get cooperation from other countries! If we&rsquo;re only half-hearted, we&rsquo;ll be defeated and possessed by demons. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re taking on the challenge with only our own elite troops, so we have no choice but to ask other countries to send their elite troops as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing that, the others agree.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way to go. This isn&rsquo;t a war anymore. We&rsquo;re locked in a race for survival against monsters, so this is no time to choose our bets. Before the outcome of the war, we must drive the demon out first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right. This isn&rsquo;t just an imperial matter anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We should contact you as soon as possible and keep in step.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just because it was the only way, he expressed his opinion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Correct. You guys are weak, and you need to use your brains more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing this, Velgrynd smiled with satisfaction and replied. But from the office&rsquo;s point of view, it was an absurd story.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please wait! I&rsquo;m sure the world leaders understand that things aren&rsquo;t going well. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;ll join hands and cooperate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, that would be difficult. No country is going to nod yes to an offer of a ceasefire out of the blue.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want that kind of suggestion in our country, do we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those are very sensible opinions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anything happens during the ceasefire is a disaster. For that to be possible, they need to at least get control of the military, which is out of control.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, there are many other problems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the popular opinion of the people won&rsquo;t be convinced.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some countries might use this as an opportunity to plot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The doubts were endless.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some argued that they could not move forward with suspicion, but if those fears are not cleared, then it is impossible to go hand in hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no such thing as a partnership in this situation, but Velgrynd smiled and said,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Will you give up without trying? Well, that&rsquo;s okay, then. I&rsquo;ll protect His Majesty and this Imperial City, His Majesty&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When she says that like he&rsquo;s a fool, the diplomatic officer has no choice but to retort.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay. Then I&rsquo;ll try to contact them. Let&rsquo;s show our utmost sincerity and at least arrange for a meeting!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he was close to retorting, he was still successful in meeting Velgrynd&rsquo;s challenge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Either way, we must do it, or we will perish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It may destroy me if I try, but I&rsquo;d like to show my determination anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Even if we lose, we&rsquo;re going to have to fight back with everything we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for my people and my family, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped. I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re under agreement, the enemy is a demon. It&rsquo;s a race for survival. A loss means the end for our nation. We must do all we can right now or we&rsquo;ll regret it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And all the officers were well agitated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd is happy to have it her way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">That&rsquo;s fine. Act before you argue about whether or not you can do it. And if you make a mistake, I&rsquo;ll do something about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She whispered the words in her heart and smiled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone knew what to do and acted accordingly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus began the last stand of the empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atlantis continent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the smallest continent located at the eastern end of the United States of Azalea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The climate is of a tropical rainforest. Most of it was heavily forested and jungle-like.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this continent had a more significant characteristic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were iron ore mines and oil-producing wells. By harnessing its rich reserves, it had become the largest military base in Azalea&rsquo;s sphere of influence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that was the beginning of the misfortune.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was an ancient ruin near the military base, but unluckily there was also an &ldquo;Underworld Gate&rdquo; that led to the other world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Long ago, there was a ceremony performed by the native tribes. They may have attempted to communicate with the gods, but as a result, a small rupture in space-time occurred. It was discovered by a phantom race and is now firmly anchored as a stable Underworld Gate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The phantoms welcomed the indigenous Azalean people as their new targets for possession. They stole the military facilities they had built and used them as a foothold for their invasion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man in a reddish-brown military uniform in the national defense guard, commanded a multitude of men of various races.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His black hair was brushed back. His thin, narrow eyes gleamed intelligently behind his glasses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">He is Cornu&rsquo;s second in command from the heavenly realm. Before he mutated and became a phantom, he was active as a cherub</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t have a name, but he now calls himself Amari Masahiko. It was the name of the man whose body he incarnated when he appeared in this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Incidentally, the three demon</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;leaders may name their subordinates after their themselves. Cornu didn&rsquo;t value the bond between the demons and their followers, which is why the demons in Cornu&rsquo;s group didn&rsquo;t have names.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Race was of no concern to the Phantoms, but Amari Masahiko was Japanese. He was an agent who had come to explore Azalea&rsquo;s military facilities and was a rival to Kondou.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was a brilliant but unlucky man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no news of Kondou&rsquo;s defeat, and by the time he learned of the enemy&rsquo;s full extent, it was too late.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was outnumbered and defeated, and his body was taken over.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The body of Masahiko was strengthened by the &lsquo;Ki Fighting Method (Battlewill)&rsquo; and was the best material for a phantom to use. More than a hundred days had passed since his manifestation, and the senior-ranked, second-in-command, had become fully capable of exerting his power even in this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His unparalleled power could reach 10 million EP.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the result of his own knowledge and skill level, and his power had increased greatly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hurry up with the expansion work. The gate is too small for Cornu-sama to descend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Originally, only those who had a magicule amount less than the size of the &ldquo;Underworld Gate&rdquo; could fully manifest from the Otherworld.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who did not had to leave their main body in the Otherworld and send out &lsquo;split bodies&rsquo; linked by a &lsquo;Soul Corridor&rsquo; to gradually regain their power.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">The only ones who do not apply to this description are the Three Demons</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The power of the three demons is so great that an Underworld Gate wouldn&rsquo;t do them justice. It must be at least a million-level gate to make them appear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incidentally, as long as the main body remained in the otherworld, they could be resurrected even if the alter ego died! However, because that gate hasn&rsquo;t fully manifested, they can only display a weakened power of less than half at most.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also, even if they were revived, only memories and experiences are inherited, and it is necessary to find another possessor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were advantages, but the disadvantages were greater.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By expanding the &quot;Underworld Gate&quot;, they could return to another world even if they are incarnated, so the phantoms were aiming for complete manifestation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The &ldquo;Underworld Gate&rdquo; was expanding day by day, and it was expanding faster than Velgrynd had expected. It was about 100,000 in existence value, so a low-intermediate level &ldquo;lieutenant&rdquo; would be able to fully manifest without any problems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The mental-controlled captives were lined up in front of the Underworld Gate. One by one, they are possessed by demons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The greatest advantage to the incarnation is that the phantoms can take their names. As half-mental life forms, they are unstable beings. By acquiring a body and a name, they established a strong sense of self.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a result of the knowledge they gain from the body they possess, even the lowest-ranking soldier had become useful in their own right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to be so hasty Masahiko-sama. Our plan is on track. I&rsquo;ve surveyed our world&rsquo;s strength and found few who pose a threat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was David Reagan who advised Masahiko to use the demon lord&rsquo;s powers. The demon that possessed him was of the rank of General, one of the highest-ranking Demon Lord Seeds. He is one of the strongest demons to achieve full manifestation, with an existence value of up to six hundred thousand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No wonder Kondou couldn&rsquo;t win.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">David&rsquo;s opponent, Li Jinlong, is the one to complain about this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I told you many times. Do you remember, Fist Saint Xianhua is still here? The way I remember her, she&rsquo;s as good a match as any officer could have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is a mid-range phantom rank. In the Otherworld, they are as powerful as Demon Lord Seeds and were the leaders of a thousand-man regiment that was the key to the invasion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike the lower-ranked ones, they were a formidable force, and losing them would seriously affect their plans. Li Jinlong&rsquo;s advice was right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But David laughs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. That man, Pulcinella-sama, has been sent to take care of him. Xianhua is no match for him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong is surprised to hear this, but was convinced with a grin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mystery Monk Pulcinella, one of mankind&rsquo;s best hope for the future. He left the oracle behind and went on a quest to find out what happened. There he fought fierce battles with demons, but was cruelly defeated and captured.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was only one reason for this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The only reason he was taken prisoner was to have a demon of the same rank as Masahiko and his &ldquo;chief strategist&rdquo; as an excellent retainer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That tragedy was fulfilled. He was now a demon of the same rank as Amari Masahiko.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seriously? I was going to go in there, but I was beaten to it. It&rsquo;s easy enough to kill them, but we&rsquo;d destroy them too. Well, Pulcinella-sama won&rsquo;t have a problem with that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">David agreed, if a little irreverently.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Humans in this world were weak. In such a situation, Xianhua, who has outstanding strength, can withstand as a substitute, enough to stand in for their chief, Cornu. It&rsquo;s because everyone thinks so that they are hesitant to leave it to the subordinates.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were too strong, even for their own rank, against humans. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a fight if they tried, but it was hard to go easy on them in these unfamiliar bodies. Cornu&rsquo;s lieutenants are on a different level, so they should be able to carry out the mission without difficulty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because of their absolute trust, David laughed that Xianhua&rsquo;s fate was as good as done.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, if Cornu-sama doesn&rsquo;t want a woman&rsquo;s body, then we&rsquo;ll find a replacement and I&rsquo;ll take Xianhua&rsquo;s place. The man who owned my body was very attached to her, and I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Soft and tender. Cornu-sama won&rsquo;t care about your gender, so you won&rsquo;t have to worry about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thinking that the problem was already solved, Li Jinlong and David started a silly conversation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he listened to them, Masahiko couldn&rsquo;t help but feel uneasy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not that he was dissatisfied with the results at this point. He was not satisfied, but he could say that they have launched an invasion of this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under Cornu&rsquo;s command, the two top general counsels and the four generals have already been revealed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The expansion of the Underworld Gate was on track, and a replacement for Cornu was on the horizon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The machinations of Pulcinella and the two remaining generals have come to fruition and the world is on the verge of ruin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All that remains is to reveal Cornu to the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">That should be the case. There&rsquo;s nothing to reverse from here. I haven&rsquo;t overlooked anything&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After calmly analyzing the situation, he had come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the anxiety of Amari Masahiko was correct.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was impossible to assume that Velgrynd had appeared.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Human resistance is insignificant, but we must not be caught off guard. There are still some finishing touches to be made. Everyone pull together and get to work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if to shake off his uneasiness, Masahiko ordered everyone to do so.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After the main conference was over, the first thing Velgrynd did was to go to the main library.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is no exaggeration to say that the library had a huge collection of books on its vast floor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason why she went there is because there was something that was said in the meeting that bothered her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the names of nations and some of the names of people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, the Holy Arcia Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This seems to have some connection to the Arcia Kingdom she led.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or the name of the president of the United States of Azalea</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">George Hayes, apparently, is the same one she had contact with before the space-time leap.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Velgrynd&rsquo;s memory was correct, his father was the owner of as piece of Rudra&rsquo;s soul. His name was Laurent Hayes, and she was with him from his youth until he died a mortal death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are many other things she was curious about, but she had to look into those matters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they were in the same world, she could be sure that they were the same nation and the same person, but there are also similar worlds in other dimensions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since there are clear differences in the origins and laws of the world, it is concluded that it is not a parallel world, but for some reason the names are similar</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Again, the possibility of this being a coincidence was undeniable, so Velgrynd decided to look into the history.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first thing she looked up was the origins of the Holy Arcia Empire, and the description of the Arcia Kingdom was confirmed. She recognized the name of the king and his chief advisors, and she was convinced that this world was descended from the Arcia Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Next, she looked up George Hayes</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. His father&rsquo;s name was Laurent Hayes. He was the president seven generations ago, so that must be it. So&hellip;George-kun could have been president, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd smiles, remembering the respect George had for his father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wanted to be a great president, just like his father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurent died at the age of 62, while George was only 27 then. Today&rsquo;s George is fifty-two years old, so in this space-time leap, she appeared 25 years later in the same world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Twenty-five years ago, Akira Sakura would have been alive and well, so someone with a piece of Rudra&rsquo;s soul must have existed at the same time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is a very rare pattern, but since the soul reacts strongly to death, it was not absolutely certain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why, while doubting the possibility of another person, she went to the large library in this way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, Laurent was surrounded and almost killed by a gang. It was there that Velgrynd was called in to rescue him, which is how she got to know Laurent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remembering that, Velgrynd feels nostalgic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She switches her mind and resumes her research.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;George-kun had a little boy, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd gave her blessing, so there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. She checked the names in the book of names and found his son&rsquo;s name was listed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emile Hayes&mdash;she was convinced that it was no longer doubtful because it matched the name she remembered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd nods with satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was then that she discovered an entry in the Biographical Directory that bothered her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh!? Was it my fault that Laurent&rsquo;s marriage was delayed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She grumbled in dissatisfaction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous,&rsquo; she thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurent Hayes had a shadow of a beautiful woman who had always followed him around, and so on, according to the biographical data.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was true, but Velgrynd was neither aware nor malicious in heart. Therefore, she dissatisfied with this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She always said he was free to fall in love, and she never meant to hold Laurent back. But there are certainly not many women who would court a man with such a beautiful woman at his side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By all accounts, it was Velgrynd who was responsible for the considerable delay in Laurent&rsquo;s marriage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who wrote this, but I&rsquo;d like to complain about it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The author was long dead, but that may have been fortunate in a way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even after she had finished her research, Velgrynd was enjoying her free time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no one to stop her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The only one who could, was Akira, but he was the one who let Velgrynd do what she wanted. Because he instinctively knew that this would lead to the most benign outcome.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, there were those who would get involved with Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not the soldiers who knew her true nature, but their wives.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Empress, Akira&rsquo;s wife, was one of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What a mess. A woman who doesn&#39;t know the bones of any horse approaches His Majesty before he knows it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a fight from the very beginning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Empress, from the Duke&rsquo;s family, was fifty years old.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Empress was still full of energy at this time when the average age was about 60 years old due to the development of medicine and magic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, for Velgrynd, she was still pretty. This had happened a lot during the long time she had spent with Rudra.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh my, you&rsquo;ll ruin your pretty face if you get so angry. I think even Akira Sakura would want his wife to always be beautiful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then she refused to fight with her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then she even patted the Empress&rsquo; face.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was so fast that the empress didn&rsquo;t even have time to try to escape, but lo and behold, her skin was instantly rejuvenated. Before long, the empress&rsquo;s skin was regaining its freshness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;See, you&rsquo;re beautiful now. But it&rsquo;s important to keep it that way. I&rsquo;m going to teach you a breathing technique to regulate your energy, so you can practice it properly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Empress was stunned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is exactly what it means to be unable to speak.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The wives of the high ranking officials who followed her are looking at her the same way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, the Empress had regained her beauty right before their eyes. They were right to be amazed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think&hellip;that&rsquo;s the secret of rejuvenation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They muttered to no one, but Velgrynd laughed and denied it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not rejuvenation. This is just a way to revitalize your cells and make you look better. It doesn&rsquo;t change your race, and your lifespan remains finite.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is a finite lifespan. Velgrynd explained that she only activated the cells by manipulating the spirit of life, and thus could not extend their lifespan, but this was misleading.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the perspective of Velgrynd, it is a small margin of error, but the life is extended.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It makes the body healthier and cures it of most diseases. The energy intake would be more efficient and one would have a perfect resistance to aging (anti-aging).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a result, the life expectancy of the Empress was more than doubled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you learn and practice breathing techniques from Velgrynd, you will live a longer life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ryuo-sama, I&rsquo;m afraid I was wrong about you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Empress instantly fell in love with Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, the same was true of her attendants.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love for you to teach us how to breathe!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They shouted out tried desperately to regain their youth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It has been a few days since Velgrynd arrived in this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Teaching the ladies breathing techniques and enjoying tea times, Velgrynd was gracefully at ease.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The military, on the other hand, has been busy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Discussions with the leaders of each country were difficult, and the prospects for meetings were unclear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Due to lack of progress, the main conference has been canceled. Instead of wasting time on useless meetings, it has been decided that the effort should be focused on something constructive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Akira Sakura has given his permission.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Velgrynd has no complaints.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the frustration is growing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were losing valuable time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even while doing this, it seems that the demons are ready, so if they don&#39;t do it early, they will not be able to hold international meetings. In that case, they would have to leave before humanity could come together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Well, okay. If that happens, the war won&rsquo;t end even if we do something about the phantoms&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That would be a problem, Velgrynd thought melancholy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So she decided to help out a bit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, Velgrynd is a very caring person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are the negotiations going well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While asking that question, she rushed into the Foreign Ministry&rsquo;s intelligence office.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a quiet time in the afternoon, but the intelligence office is a scene of chaos. The bureaucrats are in a panic because of the intrusion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Velgrynd was unconcerned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to be here. This is a restricted area&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up. It&rsquo;s been three days now, and I wonder if any country has agreed to meet with you yet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The person in charge opens his mouth heavily.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reply from China was a conditional acceptance on the condition that the other nations would join. The same was true of the Great Roziam Dynasty, which was synonymous with reluctant refusal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is because the United States of Azalea and the Holy Arcia Empire responded that this was not the case.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under these circumstances, it is out of the question for the leaders to go abroad. Even if they were holding a communications conference, they could not afford to do so, that was the truth of the matter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We are patiently trying to persuade them to do so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the person in charge sounds annoyed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing this, Velgrynd is puzzled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That will take a long time. It can&rsquo;t be helped, so let me help you with that a little bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the point of view of Masayuki and others, it was the very definition of tsundere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the hard-headed and proud bureaucrats are not convinced.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;But</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you listen silently, you&rsquo;ll be fine! I agree that you&rsquo;re strong and beautiful, but information strategy is our domain. I wish you&rsquo;d keep your mouth shut.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though he was angry, he had to admit that Velgrynd was beautiful. It was understandable that such a high official didn&rsquo;t want to be interfered with by amateurs, but this was a bad reaction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s left up to you, we won&rsquo;t be able to make a move in time for the enemy to come to us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And well, it made Velgrynd grumpy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Just switch seats,&rsquo; Velgrynd said, and took her place in front of the communications equipment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She knows how to use it with a quick glance. Dhnr can easily make the connection to Azalea&rsquo;s U.S. intelligence in one motion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You hear me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd calls out from above without even checking the other party. The other party won&rsquo;t have to answer, but it responds uncomfortably.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are persistent. I&rsquo;ve told my superiors what your country wants, but the President is busy. Please understand that there is no time for negotiations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it&rsquo;s an enemy country, it was the same in that they were used by demons. That&rsquo;s why they didn&rsquo;t despise them, and they handled it well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they still couldn&rsquo;t get to the meeting because of the turmoil within the United States. The Imperial side knew that, too, and that&rsquo;s why they couldn&rsquo;t push it through.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that was none of Velgrynd&rsquo;s business.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come on, call your president, George-kun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you. And it&rsquo;s not polite to mention the president&rsquo;s name so casually. You know he is busy here</span><span class="c9">&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you tell him that Velgrynd is calling, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll listen to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a hint of confusion on the other end, but Velgrynd cut the communication.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the alleged enemy president of the United States of Azalea is acquainted with her, there is no way to take advantage of that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rest is up to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If she can get a message to President George, then they can move quickly. Otherwise, she would be going to go to them herself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is where she was twenty-five years ago, so she has the coordinates for George&rsquo;s country. The space-time lapse was also reflected in the coordinates, so &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo; could be performed without any problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">If I don&rsquo;t hear from him after a day of waiting, I&rsquo;ll go to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Velgrynd decided to approach the Holy Arcia Empire this time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had an idea of how to handle those negotiations as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She precisely manipulated their magical communication circuits and connected them to the channel in an instant. She called up the number and made her demands unilaterally.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell the emperor that he must do as I ask. Then I will provide you with another sacred artifact. Sword, spear, bow, whatever you wish. I, Velgrynd, will make you a promise so you should move quickly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The person being told is puzzled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They don&#39;t remember being obliged to obey a woman who calls herself Velgrynd, but the call is on a formal international line. There was no option to ignore it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, there was no way he could see the Emperor as a communications officer, even if he wanted to. The real intention was not to make a mess.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he still reported to his superiors.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason being the word &lsquo;sacred artifact.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the Holy Arcia Empire, there was a fighting group that was well known in other lands.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a national force, they are known as the Seven Sacred Vessels. These seven possess abilities beyond human knowledge&hellip; but it is their weapons that are the most famous.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only when they are chosen to be owners of the weapons can they call themselves one of the Seven Vessels.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This story has been handed down since the beginning of the nation&rsquo;s history and is known to all of Arcia&rsquo;s people. Of course, others knew it, but it was a great sin to speak of it so casually.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s more than one man would ever say in a conversation on the phone between nations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the contents of the communication were recorded as evidence, it was no wonder the war had escalated because of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why there was no choice but to tell them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anticipating this, Velgrynd&rsquo;s negotiating skills were evident.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was awful for those who were listening.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You! It was enough with the United States of Azalea. No, it&rsquo;s not good, but I would argue that you&rsquo;re not the only one responsible. But there&rsquo;s no excuse for the Holy Arcia Empire!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right! Moreover, using an alias is a brazen thing to do. It&rsquo;ll be found out, and we&rsquo;ll be in big trouble!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd had no intention of using a false name, but to an uninformed person it seemed like she was trying to deceive them. It was a misunderstanding, but Velgrynd was too lazy to explain, so she let it slide.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Either way, it&rsquo;s up to them. There was no point in making a fuss here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s how Velgrynd finished her preparations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ignore the complaints.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gracefully, She prepared a cup of tea and enjoyed it while waiting for word.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Ministry of Foreign Affair&rsquo;s chief of intelligence fell silent, looking furious. Depending on how the other side responds, he&rsquo;d do whatever it took to blame Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">I&rsquo;ll give you credit for being strong, girl. But I&rsquo;m not fooled. I kept silent because I was in front of His Majesty, but I imagine that she has a mind to deceive us with her grandiose lies while everyone&rsquo;s minds are weak.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was engulfed in fumes during the main conference, but in retrospect, Velgrynd&rsquo;s story is too wild to be true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they are true, there is no hope left for mankind. No matter how powerful Velgrynd is, they are no match for the mythical army.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that in mind, the official&rsquo;s hostility toward the Velgrynd was growing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the flip side of his fear, but he was unaware of it. He just drowned his fears in anger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then he waits for a while.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Velgrynd? It&rsquo;s me, Velgrynd!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The call was from the United States of Azalea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is surprisingly fast compared to usual.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there&rsquo;s no doubt in her mind who the caller is&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, George-kun, right? I hear that you&rsquo;re the president now? I wish Laurent could have seen you as a grown-up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was President George himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, you really are Velgrynd! I&rsquo;m so glad. I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ever hear from you again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who were listening to the conversation were amazed beyond words.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Ah!? Wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Velgrynd&rdquo; a fake name? No, that&rsquo;s not important. I seriously don&rsquo;t understand how Ryuo-dono could know the President&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The senior official was also confused.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was about to dismiss her as an insolent liar, and now he&rsquo;s developed respect for her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd didn&rsquo;t care what people thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, George-kun. I&rsquo;m sorry, but we have to get to the important stuff first and can catch up later. Do you understand the situation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ve got something I want to talk to you about too. Can you listen to me after this matter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. You&rsquo;re Laurent&rsquo;s pride and joy, so you&rsquo;re like a child to me too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you. That&rsquo;s a relief to hear. So, it&rsquo;s quite a situation, but I think we&rsquo;ll have to reconcile it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I agree. So, then, can you agree to what we ask of you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not a problem. When will the meeting take place?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check with Rudr</span><span class="c9">a&mdash;the </span><span class="c6">Emperor</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">and get back to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, so there was another one at the same time as my father, wasn&rsquo;t there? All right. I can&rsquo;t wait right here, but I&rsquo;ll make arrangements to be available at any time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, the call ended.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd had successfully made an appointment with the President.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t long before word from Arcia arrived.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is Velgrynd-sama there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Excuse me. I am Bright, First Chair of the Seven Vessels of the Holy Arcia Empire. I have the honor of speaking with Velgrynd-sama, but I would like to confirm one point.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it true that you are the Goddess herself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? What&rsquo;s the point of that question?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was talking about how he was going to find out if Velgrynd&rsquo;s words were true or false.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Or is there anyone still alive who can judge the truth of my words?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In the first place, I didn&rsquo;t think the king wouldn&rsquo;t respond to my name when I mentioned it. It&rsquo;s pathetic. Shin&rsquo;s descendants have become so small.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Shin? You mean, His Majesty Shin, the Emperor? You are insulting the Imperial Family of Arcia</span><span class="c9">&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been wondering, why are you called the Seven Sacred Vessels? I left you twelve mythical-grade vessels. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s true, but were they lost or stolen? I mean, what makes you think that there isn&rsquo;t someone out there who&rsquo;s qualified to be a mastermind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bright&rsquo;s anger fizzled out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The chief of the Seven Vessels was convinced at this point.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman who answered his questions, the one who claimed to be Velgrynd, was undoubtedly the true goddess.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">I remember hearing from my master that there were twelve sacred artifacts. This is a true story that has only survived by oral tradition, so the one who knows this must be the real one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There used to be twelve sacred artifacts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because they were a national asset and trump card, it was stipulated that only seven would be disclosed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that doesn&rsquo;t mean there are twelve owners of the artifacts. As Velgrynd pointed out, there were only eight of them at the moment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the more than four thousand years of history of the Holy Arcia Empire, three of its sacred artifacts had been lost. One betrayal and two non-returnees. Now there are only nine artifacts left in Arcia&rsquo;s possession.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now there is only one secret member of the emperor&rsquo;s secret army, and one masterless artifact still languishing in a treasure trove of dead treasure.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fact that Velgrynd had guessed so well upset Bright.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;s not the only reason.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All Bright had to do was to hear Velgrynd&rsquo;s voice and he was overwhelmed. It was more that he sensed that Velgrynd&rsquo;s voice was real.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, regardless of what Velgrynd said, Bright bowed down to the communications equipment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It didn&rsquo;t matter if he didn&rsquo;t see her or not. It was his respect for Velgrynd that made him do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Goddess. I will immediately send a message to Emperor Arcia and inform him of your request!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;Oh, really? Well in that case, it&rsquo;s okay to entrust it to you, so move quickly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Haha!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd wasn&rsquo;t quite ready to complain yet, but she allowed Bright to go ahead with her goal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the Holy Arcia Empire agreed to her request.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then, next is the Great Roziam Dynasty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that muttered, Velgrynd once again turned on the communications equipment and channeled it to the Foreign Intelligence Agency of the Great Roziam Dynasty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the signal that was supposed to connect was blocked by some kind of interference.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd. You there, when was the last time you contacted the Great Roziam Dynasty?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The designated representative replies hastily.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In the early hours of the morning today! We&rsquo;ve been in regular contact six times a day, day and night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since it was wartime, the window was open regardless of time difference. This is an action in accordance with the agreement of each country, and it is a measure to negotiate quickly according to the war situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Normally they would negotiate a ceasefire, but this time they are using it to share information on the common enemy, the demon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since both sides were in a position to allow the military to run amok, they were also trying to understand the current situation when considering the timings to explain to the people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There was nothing unusual in that case, was there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, not particularly&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no progress, but there was nothing unusual. The person in charge replied, puzzled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now is just the time for a regular lunchtime call. It&rsquo;s unlikely that the other party is not at home, and since the communication facility is not in one place, it&rsquo;s unlikely that the machine is malfunctioning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Certainly, there was a high probability that something out of the ordinary had occurred, even the person in charge had come to the conclusion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under such circumstances, Velgrynd is operating normally.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Magical interference is just not on this world&rsquo;s level. In other words, it&rsquo;s safe to assume that the demon has done something. But they&rsquo;re still unlucky to have done it when I&rsquo;m on to them. No. It&rsquo;s different. Rudra&rsquo;s luck must be working. That&rsquo;s my Rudra!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was responding with happy thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, magic and witchcraft are the norm in this world, and it is difficult to use magic that can interfere with the laws of the world. So Velgrynd&rsquo;s guess was indeed correct.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, complimenting Rudra here was an overestimate. This is because the current Akira Sakura does not have such power, so this situation was just a coincidence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, the phantoms were unlucky. The plan for the invasion was guaranteed to fall apart once Velgrynd intervened in earnest.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd quickly manipulated the communication equipment and drew a precise magic circle in the air. Two magic circles no larger than thirty centimeters in diameter illuminated the communications equipment with a mysterious glow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd&rsquo;s magic was transformed into radio waves that are delivered to the land of the Great Roziam Dynasty at a distance. There it became an interference wave again, instantly destroying the sabotage the phantom was attempting to create.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">To an ordinary person</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c6">No, even to the master-level sorcerers of this worl</span><span class="c9">d&mdash;</span><span class="c0">this was a feat beyond comprehension.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is there someone here? Please tell me if there is anyone to reply&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re connected! Help, a demon has invaded the royal palace! They cut off all means of communication to the outside world, and we were at a loss!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic, fool. We belong to the Great Japanese Empire. I&rsquo;m not saying that we won&rsquo;t cooperate, but we can&rsquo;t just have you asking for help out of the blue.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a valid argument.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Great Roziam soldiers have regained their composure after hearing Velgrynd&rsquo;s response. There was a brief pause, as if they were consulting. Then they were replaced by a calmer voice and the conversation resumed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about earlier. I am Sergei, Director of Foreign Intelligence of the Grand Roziam Dynasty. At the risk of sounding disgraceful, we need your support. We are sending out a series of dispatches to the various Great Roziam locations, but nobody is responding. Will your country please contact us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If she was willing, Sergei will give an encryption code that will lead to various military bases.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The resistance in the royal palace continues, but the power of the demon was overwhelming.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;re hiding out for now, but it&rsquo;s clear that if they don&rsquo;t do something, they&rsquo;ll be traced back to their refuge. She knows that if that happens, she won&rsquo;t be able to protect the royals he took out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Sergei has decided to send for reinforcements from all over the country to help escape from the demons in the chaos.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, the fate of the Great Roziam Dynasty rested on the Empire&rsquo;s response.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I told you, I don&rsquo;t want you to make arbitrary demands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Wait, if you help us</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Calm down. I don&rsquo;t care about your situation. All you have to do is nod to my request.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She doesn&rsquo;t listen to people&rsquo;s requests, but rather conveys her requests. Moreover, Velgrynd says she only accepts consent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That attitude was very Velgrynd-like.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will convey your request. I will hold an international conference to ascertain the will of the world, and you will bring royalty or someone in command to it. If you do, I will help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A question should have been asked about this, but for some reason Sergei believed it. He glanced around the room and saw the noblemen who huddled there, needing to be protected.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">It&rsquo;s my job to protect these men. Now</span><span class="c9 c16">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergei understood that there was no other way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Trusting the word of a stranger is a folly he would never normally take. But now, even if he was deceived by those words, he still had no time to waste.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">In terms of risk, it&rsquo;s no different whether I believe it or not. Then in the end, it&rsquo;s fun to dream of hope. I apoligize if I implicate the noblemen of the realm in my own stupidity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Sergei is prepared to do so.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Forgive me, I know you think this is a stupid time to ask, but it is requested that we hold an international meeting. Would it be possible for His Majesty to participate?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the highest authority in the room who answered that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emperor Magellan of the Great Russian Dynasty, 35 years old. Although still young, he has been on the throne for ten years. He was so ambitious that he decided to invade China to take over the northern continent as absolute ruler.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, there were objections from the military, but there were also many bellicose opinions, and the war began with Magellan&rsquo;s will taking precedence&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magellan also suffered a major setback here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was tormented by a sense of helplessness in the face of an enemy that could not be measured by human common sense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all this time, Magellan regrets his decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had launched a campaign against China, but it had led to political instability.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magellan had a penchant for luxury, but not for misrule. The people would not object to the emperor living a noble life if their lives were relieved.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the war had changed the situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would deprive their people of their rich granaries.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They want to take an ice-free harbor for national defense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What began as a policy of only looking out for their own interests turned into a disaster when the Holy Arcia Empire invaded the Great Roziam Dynasty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were caught between a rock and a hard place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the time the demon&rsquo;s plan had worked, the situation was already too chaotic to recover from.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">It was so foolish when I think about it now. I shouldn&rsquo;t have listened to his words at that time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was true that the words of his confidant at the time had turned Magellan&rsquo;s attention to the war. It was later revealed that his confidant was taken over by a demon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demons are mysterious beings who tend to enjoy causing humanity to fight each other and leading the world to destruction rather than destroying it with their own hands.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Magellan is still alive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">That demon was fearsome. We can&rsquo;t win. Even with Pulcinella, we would still be defeated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magellan shuddered as he remembered the smiling demon with a confused look on his face.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Mystery Monk Pulcinella, their lifeline, was now in the hands of the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why there are riots in the capital.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s true that it is wartime now and there&rsquo;s unrest among the people. But the country hadn&rsquo;t been exposed to the fire, and the food supply hadn&rsquo;t been cut off.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The situation was not quite rioting, but it was getting worse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a Phantom who encouraged the followers of Pulcinella.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now it was no longer possible for the Imperial Guard to protect the palace alone. With the danger outside the palace, it seemed only a matter of time before they were caught.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Magellan had no choice but to nod in agreement with the enemy&rsquo;s offer without hope.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Understood!</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergei saluted at Magellan&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he turned to the communications equipment and resumed his conversation with Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I approve of everything. But unfortunately</span><span class="c9">&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Great Roziam Dynasty is in the middle of an emergency.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if he wanted to, he couldn&rsquo;t go&hellip;and Sergei tried to tell her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They will help if they accept the meeting, so they will send reinforcements. If the Empire moves quickly to rescue them, there&rsquo;s a chance they can get out of this themselves. No, Sergei did not want to risk his own life&hellip; but he knew that the imperial family, the symbol of the dynasty, must be saved at all costs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then a surprising thing happens.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd said she would help.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If so, it was bound to be a fixed future.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good. I&rsquo;m glad to see that you&rsquo;re not an idiot. Okay, a gate will appear there, so please go through it and come over here immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as Velgrynd finished speaking, the space in front of Sergei&rsquo;s eyes became distorted. And on the other side of that chasm was the place where Velgrynd sat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the &lsquo;Spacetime Connection,&rsquo; a supernatural phenomenon that connected two different spatial coordinates without regard for distance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;No way</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the moment when the hearts of everyone there, except for Velgrynd, became one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no hierarchy of who was the best. They all understood that this woman&mdash;Velgrynd&mdash;was the only one who absolutely could not be made an enemy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I mean, what? Why are the Great Roziam people here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, no, no, is this a dream? I mean, it hurts&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of those who could not acknowledge reality even tried to pinch their own cheeks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Unbelievable. According to the literature, there are some people in the God/Buddha class who handle transference spells, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were those who tried their best to analyze the phenomenon that had just occurred, but their understanding was not up to par. It couldn&rsquo;t be helped since it was an unimaginable supernatural power, such as connecting spaces separated by a distance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In the blink of an eye, the three countries&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The best of them may have been the ones who shifted their thinking in a practical direction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Goddess, you are indeed a goddess!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The bureaucrats in the Foreign Ministry&rsquo;s Intelligence Bureau were stunned by Velgrynd&rsquo;s skill and ability.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this point, no one could go against Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dignitaries have carefully cultivated the respect they&rsquo;ve developed for Velgrynd and are now turning themselves to her.

I&rsquo;m sorry, but if you&rsquo;re asking me to rescue anyone other than the ones in that room, that&rsquo;s outside the contract. But hey, if we can destroy the demons in a short period of time, I think we can get them all out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those from the camp could only nod in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s true that there were others in the palace who hadn&rsquo;t escaped. But they were the first to give up on rescuing them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They couldn&rsquo;t be so foolish as to pass the blame on to Velgrynd now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you for your help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quickly recovering from the chaos, Sergei thanked her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magellan hears this, and also thinks it&rsquo;s time to thank her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I thank you as well. And when all this is over, I promise to reward you as you wish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing this, Velgrynd snorted disinterestedly. Even if it was the Great Emperor, Velgrynd was arrogant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it. You can&rsquo;t give me what I want, anyway. More importantly, I hope you&rsquo;ll cooperate well with me on future missions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; no, of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magellan was miffed when someone laughed at him for not wanting a reward. But he didn&rsquo;t have the temper to be angry here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Over here, the status of the Emperor of the Great Roziam Dynasty does not mean much. He understood that he was only helped because he was useful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can you at least tell me your name, my benefactor?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can call me Ryuo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Okay.

In this place, she was the law.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quickly, a bureaucrat rises and leaves the room. He&rsquo;s gone to get a room ready for the unexpected guests.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another bowed to Magellan and gave him directions. They were to wait in the parlor until the rooms were ready.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though they hadn&rsquo;t had any meetings, the roles were divided up fluidly. Such coordination is a great thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For once, Velgrynd took a moment to review the Foreign Ministry&rsquo;s intelligence officers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, at that time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sensitive to see the opportunity, the most prominent official gives tea to Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Ryuo-dono, there&rsquo;s not only black tea</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c6">, but also green tea</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t waste time waiting for a reply from the Chinese group and was intent on appealing to her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re so witty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Thank you! For me, Yamamoto Kanji</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span class="c0">, your words alone are enough to fill me up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The high ranking official Yamamoto continued to flirt with her with all his might.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was also a talent, so much so that his subordinates were impressed by it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s delicious. It has a sweet, fluffy aroma, but it has a refreshing aftertaste.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I ordered it from my favorite store, and I&rsquo;m very proud of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I like it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In that case, you might enjoy the tea sweets here along with other items.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamamoto took out an elegantly sweet raw chocolate fondant. In this wartime era, it was an extremely luxurious item.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamamoto had to ask for money and power to prepare it forhimself, but he offered it to Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was very good, so Velgrynd was satisfied.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yamamoto Kanji, wasn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ll remember that name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Haha! I thankfully and happily accept!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Velgrynd who remembered Yamamoto&rsquo;s name even though she didn&rsquo;t care about anyone who wasn&rsquo;t interesting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had a surprising weakness for bribes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But money would not have been the motive, so it could be said that Yamamoto&rsquo;s tact was a quick win.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, it took a while to wait.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;China is responding! They are willing to accept the meeting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The long-awaited reply was an acceptance. And now, the meeting of the five heads of state was to take place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What, is that the truth?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you a lie.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Akira Sakura was astonished to receive the report from Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A meeting between the two leaders, which was thought to be impossible, turned out to be a simple affair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">As usual, unfathomable. We are fortunate to have this woman on our side, but relationships built on favor are far too distorted to be reliable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Depending on Velgrynd&rsquo;s mood, a good relationship could change. Akira Sakura thought that was scary.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A relationship of trust is an accumulation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you do too much, the other person will be angry, or even forgiven, and so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the same between nations, and if you do not share certain values, it is difficult to get along.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the opponent is an invader such as the phantoms, a conversation will not be established, so they will be recognized as an enemy without any questions. It&rsquo;s a shame that an intelligent life form has to resort to violence, but they have to draw the line at some point.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, in the case of Velgrynd&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good for you, Rudra. I&rsquo;ll set up the meeting as well, so what time would be convenient for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s obvious that Velgrynd has full confidence in him, and that&rsquo;s why Akira Sakura feels he has to brace himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A favor for a favor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s the conclusion Akira Sakura came to.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has no choice but to believe in Velgrynd, so there is no need to hesitate. He can only return the gratitude he feels with all his might.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s the only way to repay Velgrynd, Akira Sakura thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you, Velgrynd. I hope you will continue to help us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ufufu. It&rsquo;s okay, don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd smiles and looks truly happy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To her, Rudra&rsquo;s happiness is her own, so Akira Sakura&rsquo;s response was the right thing to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The date and time of the meeting is set for the next day, after lunch.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since measures against demons need to be made as soon as possible, there is no time to make extensive adjustments. Therefore, it was Akira Sakura&rsquo;s decision to prioritize efficiency.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He doesn&rsquo;t care about the time difference, or even the convenience of the other side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He told the other nations that this was the case and obtained their approval.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was hard on the Foreign Ministry&rsquo;s intelligence department, but Velgrynd couldn&rsquo;t have cared less.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was Yamamoto. Good work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You could say that he was giving it the utmost consideration just because he labored so hard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it&rsquo;s not Yamamoto who worked hard, it&rsquo;s the bureaucrats who are really poor&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if it&rsquo;s just their job and they shouldn&rsquo;t complain, Velgrynd announces her next request.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then make sure the hall is ready by tomorrow morning. Be solemn, so as not to embarrass His Majesty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d be happy to!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd pretends to be quite unreasonable, but Yamamoto had no choice but to accept. On the contrary, he even seemed slightly pleased.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It may have opened a strange door, but that was also not Velgrynd&rsquo;s concern.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh yeah, just move a set of communication equipment to a slightly larger room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the meeting was to be held by correspondence, Yamamoto had planned to prepare it in the first conference room instead of the larger room. He couldn&rsquo;t read the intent of Velgrynd&rsquo;s statement and couldn&rsquo;t help but ask back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Asking the others to come here, just like you invited the Great Roziam party. Wouldn&rsquo;t that save us a lot of effort and waste?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t a matter of opinion, but rather an unorthodox suggestion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s what Yamamoto thinks, but he understands somewhere in his reasoning that it&rsquo;s better if it&rsquo;s possible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What, do you have a problem with that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no! I&rsquo;ll have it ready to go right away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah? Well, good luck with that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd recovered, smiled, and left.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The remaining Yamamoto looked around at the bureaucrats.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Idiot! Of course, we&rsquo;ll do as we&rsquo;re told! We&rsquo;ll review the settings.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Underdstood!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And in parallel, move all the communication equipment to Conference Room 2!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The long night at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Intelligence had begun.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the fateful day for the survival of mankind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Conference Room 2, which had changed overnight, Velgrynd nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In front of her was a set of communication equipment and a plush chair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soft cushions were provided for her comfort.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The spacious room had been cleared of extraneous equipment and was ready to receive the visiting heads of state.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Snacks and beverages are available near the wall, and there are several waiters standing in line.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The furnishings were elegant and carefully considered so as not to diminish the dignity of the kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I like it. You did well, Yamamoto.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hah! Thank you. Just to hear you say that, I, Yamamoto, feel like I&rsquo;m in heaven!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man who specializes in brown-nosing. Yamamoto Kanji.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Through the supervision of a once-in-a-lifetime supervisor, he succeeded in gaining recognition from Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incidentally, this is truly an achievement, since Velgrynd&rsquo;s eyes are unusually discerning. Even the military officials who came to check on the situation were impressed by how well he managed to do this in just one night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the subordinates who had responded to Yamamoto&rsquo;s recklessness were beaming with pride.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re running out of time, so let&rsquo;s get started.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd sits in the chair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the grace of a dominatrix, yet still swift. She handled the communication equipment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first caller is the United States of Azalea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;George-kun, how are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, yeah. It&rsquo;s good to hear from you, how nostalgic. Everything is as usual, so it&rsquo;s a mess. But I&rsquo;m relieved that you haven&rsquo;t changed, if that&rsquo;s strange to say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">President George is understandably confused.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, he was coming to the Empire through the &lsquo;Spacetime Connection&rsquo; without even bothering to say hello on the phone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the Azalean government ministers who came with him can&rsquo;t believe their eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ufufu.

It may have been twenty-five years for you, but for me, we just parted ways a few days ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd and George are chatting about the past.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamamoto moves so as not to interrupt their conversation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a casual glance, the servers begin to work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the confused Azaleans seemed to take a breather and their heads start to spin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beside them, Velgrynd was having a lively conversation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time ago. Thanks to that man, I didn&rsquo;t have to be bored every day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I heard that you always went along with my dad&rsquo;s big legalities.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. The day before the typhoon, &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll clear up tomorrow&rsquo; was a big deal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know, that story. He told me that story over and over. Thanks to you, you really made it better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well. There was a baseball game that day, and the neighborhood kids were looking forward to it. He was always teasing them and lying about it all the time. Maybe that&rsquo;s why. &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if my words came true once in a while?&rsquo; he said. You know, I was really surprised how it made me work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone was struck by the story that the typhoon had disappeared.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even want to hide that you&rsquo;re not normal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some couldn&rsquo;t hide their surprise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without realizing it, or even if they did, they didn&rsquo;t care, the conversation between Velgrynd and the President continued.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that so? All Dad said was that &lsquo;the kids were freaked out and it was super funny&rsquo;, so I never knew that was the reason&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh-huh. The kids were so excited, too. The players got all worked up that day, and we had an oversized home run.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s true. My kids love baseball, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this point, Velgrynd noticed that George&rsquo;s expression had become cloudy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a subtle change that a normal person wouldn&rsquo;t notice, but Velgrynd noticed it because she could read other people&rsquo;s emotions from their thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Speaking of which, how is Emile-chan doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emile Hayes, the name of George&rsquo;s son.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd deduces from her conversation with George that Emile is the reason for George&rsquo;s anxiety. So she decided to use his name as a sounding board for George to talk to.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing, Velgrynd. I&rsquo;m no match for you, you know everything&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. I&rsquo;m just worried about you, you&rsquo;re like my son.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fufu, thanks. I guess I&rsquo;m not a good person to talk to about this kind of thing, as a representative of the state. Still, you&rsquo;re the only person I know who can help me. Can you help me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. Because you&rsquo;re the son of my beloved Laurent Hayes, the genius scammer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">George bursts into tears when he hears this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, after muttering to help his son, he started talking about the situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Things have gotten pretty ugly, from what is heard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The US Department of Defense is already aware that the US military in Azalea has been hijacked by the Phantom. Worst of all, Fleet Commander-in-Chief: David Reagan has sent a messenger with a demand to the government.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demand is that the United States government accept the demon&rsquo;s control.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demon&rsquo;s goal is not to end humanity. They want to rule this world and build their own paradise. That&rsquo;s why they thought that if they destroyed the organization that governed the nation, it would be too much trouble to deal with afterwards.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c9">&mdash;T</span><span class="c0">hat&rsquo;s why they told us to follow them. That way, they wouldn&rsquo;t take away the government officials&rsquo; free will, and they&rsquo;d continue to guarantee our safety.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. And what if you don&rsquo;t give in to the demands?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to send the Grand South Sea Fleet to attack the capital of the United States. And at the same time, they&rsquo;re going to tell the people exactly what&rsquo;s happening. That will destroy the prestige of the government and cause uncontrollable panic. The truth is that we have no idea what to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Given the choices, the opinions are divided. But whichever choice they make, the phantom has the advantage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, thinks Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demons&rsquo; goal is to enslave mankind. They want to keep bodies to replace their own in case their numbers grow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be better to have slaves under control, but there are five spheres of influence in this world. The destruction of one of them would only serve as an example to the rest of the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Compared to the total number of phantoms, there are more humans than there are phantoms. Even if the human race was reduced to less than a tenth, there would still be enough dependents.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. China must be in a similar situation, and the Great Roziam Dynasty must have stubbornly stuck to its demands, and the royal family is even in danger of extinction due to the riots. In this way, the Empirre was in a relatively better situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a matter of time. The combined fleet of our country and the Chinese will be here soon, won&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m here, so it&rsquo;s not a problem. I&rsquo;d rather hear about Emile-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Velgrynd let the subject of the Grand Fleet slide, Yamamoto and the rest of the Imperial Bureaucracy and Azalea&rsquo;s government ministers made ridiculous expressions</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But no one interrupted them as they waited for George to speak.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were afraid to interrupt, lest they might offend Velgrynd. At this point everyone knew that Velgrynd was a woman not to be crossed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The messenger who came was Emile. He had the same face as my son, the same knowledge, but he had a very evil look on his face&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emile had grown up and become a soldier. And unfortunately, he had been sent to the fleet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, George. Calm down. What did I tell you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd smiles when she hears the story, saying it&rsquo;s okay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a perfect, unflappable, ladylike smile.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That smile apparently had a calming effect on the viewer&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Haha, always so soothing, right?</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">I remember that, Velgrynd.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as George regained his composure, he remembered his duties as president.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good job. Rest assured, Emile-chan will be safe with me. And I&rsquo;ll protect the honor of the United States as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Thank you</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">If you say that, I can be relieved. Please, save the United States&hellip;and my son.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Leave it to me. We&rsquo;ve got a couple of months until the demon is fully assimilated into human form. Emile-chan will be fine. And by the way, so will the other generals.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It makes me feel better to hear that. But it&rsquo;s been three weeks since I was dispatched, so I don&rsquo;t have a lot of days left until the grace period&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re meeting today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">George nodded widely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;All right. I promise to cooperate to the best of my ability. Let&rsquo;s hope the meetings will be fruitful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, George stands up. The Azalea government ministers who had been watching in silence followed suit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The discussion is over.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamamoto gave the signal and an usher immediately opened the door.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then, I will show you to your waiting room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone seemed relieved to hear Velgrynd&rsquo;s strong words. With words of thanks, they left the room as they were led away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd&rsquo;s next call was from the Holy Arcia Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An incomprehensible &lsquo;Spacetime Connection&rsquo; had brought them across the sea. If you imagine their feelings, it&rsquo;s impossible not to get confused.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;it&#39;s a secret place that only a few people know, so how can&hellip;why&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the ministers muttered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd, overhearing this, snorts boringly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to be located, use &lsquo;Isolation&rsquo; or &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; whenever possible to cut off all contact with the outside world. Even then, air currents and such will leak out, so it&rsquo;s probably impossible for you to hide.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Communicating with the outside world&hellip; Do you mean you traced a radio signal to the location where we were hiding?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the young men spoke up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because he was carrying a mythical-grade bow, Velgrynd realized that he must be one of the Seven Vessels.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she&rsquo;s not particularly interested, so she just says, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Arcia crowd is in an uproar, but it&rsquo;s not Velgrynd who has to deal with it. It&rsquo;s like a joke to her, so she doesn&rsquo;t make a fuss about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there was another who was arrogant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re Velgrynd. I am Zang, The Emperor of Arcia of this world. You&rsquo;re the one who claims to be Caldina, the goddess who gave blessings to Emperor Shin, my grandfather, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A handsome young man in his early 20s with blond hair and blue eyes and a well-proportioned body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was Zang Yulan Dorte Arcia, the apex emperor of the Holy Arcia Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Caldina? Oh, that&rsquo;s what I was called. I&rsquo;ve heard it said that it&rsquo;s awe-inspiring to call me by my true name, or something like that, but I didn&rsquo;t think that the nickname was more established&hellip; maybe my real name isn&rsquo;t in the records?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You still won&rsquo;t admit it? How laughable! Or did you think that your good looks would absolve you of your delusion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He chalked up Velgrynd&rsquo;s statement as a lie and refused to listen to it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That attitude was a big problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the top brass made a mistake, an apology often wouldn&rsquo;t suffice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If this was a subordinate&rsquo;s outburst, then that person alone could be held responsible. Or the higher-ups might be able to get away with an apology.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if the chief executive makes a wrong choice, the consequences may be irreversible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bright, the first seat of the Seventh God Vessel, almost cried when he heard Zang&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">You idiot! After all the explanations I&rsquo;ve given you, you have no idea how crazy Velgrynd-sama is? Before that, if you were to see a supernatural phenomenon that had just occurred in front of you, you should know that it was obviously God&rsquo;s work!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was in a panic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Spacetime Connection&rsquo; is obviously impossible for a normal person. If not a goddess, then it&rsquo;s no doubt the closest thing to one who is able to do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What was the point of offending such an opponent?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was one more person who was troubled by this situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Yamamoto Kanji.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Oh my god, the Lord of Arcia is an unbelievable jerk! What should we do now? If nothing is done, the fearsome Ryuo-dono will become angry&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since it was not just another person&rsquo;s affair, Yamamoto racked his brain frantically.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first thing he did was to send a message to his aides.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bring His Majesty to me as soon as possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fool! I know this is impolite, but only His Majesty can stop Ryuo-dono!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was so true that even his aides are struck dumb by his opinion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as he whispered his approval, the aide scurried away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamamoto Kanji, normally a pompous buffoon, but he had a real talent for spotting people who should not be crossed. He used this ability without regret to prepare for this crisis.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While everyone around him felt threatened, one man was at ease in making that statement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kukku-kukku, are you speechless, knowing that I&rsquo;m not so easily fooled? Well, that&rsquo;s just as well. A scammer like you might not know this, but I&rsquo;m not like the rest of the foolish ones. I, too, have been approved by the gods! The seventh seat of the Seven Sacred Vessels. That is the one you&rsquo;ve been trying to take in! The true identity of the person who did it!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zang said proudly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These words were true, and at Zang&rsquo;s waist hung a shining mythical-grade sword.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, Velgrynd also knows.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was just too dumbfounded to speak before that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">You&rsquo;re lying, right?

Did you mean me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you can&rsquo;t understand such things. But it sounds like you&rsquo;ve got more than 4,000 years of history behind you, so I suppose it&rsquo;s no wonder your bloodline has deteriorated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd chuckles. She was appalled by Zang&rsquo;s outburst, but she was not so narrow-minded as to be offended by it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Zang was furious.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmph, you still haven&rsquo;t stopped acting, and even taunted me. Foolishness. Then I will ask you! You not only deceive the goddess&rsquo;s name with impudence, but you claim to be able to recreate her deeds, don&rsquo;t you? If you say you can make the sacred artifacts, let&rsquo;s see it. However&hellip;prepare yourself. And if you fail to do so, that&rsquo;s when your disguise will come undone!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so troublesome!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmph! I don&rsquo;t want excuses. You spoke of something impossible, and you will pay for it. What? I&rsquo;m not going to kill you. It seems that you are good at what you do, and have some ability. You can rest assured that you will be kept as my companion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zang talks stupid nonsense all the way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone aside from Velgrynd and Zang watched with bated breath to see what would happen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although Zang&rsquo;s words and actions were clearly wrong, they saw a glimmer of hope in the patience of Velgrynd, who was quick to anger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone looks at Velgrynd, praying that this story will be settled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it anyway</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot to say, but oh well. It was promised, so I&rsquo;ll prepare it for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if to interrupt Zang&rsquo;s words, Velgrynd made a blue dragon sword appear. It was created with &lsquo;Matter Creation&rsquo; by solidifying her own magic element.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is fine. You guys may not be able to handle it anyway, but it has unmistakable mythical-grade capabilities.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Wha</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zang received it unexpectedly and was mesmerized by the brilliance of the Blue Dragon Sword. He didn&rsquo;t need to doubt Velgrynd&rsquo;s words, it had a real glow to it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a king, Zang was not entirely incompetent. Although he is arrogant, he is not a tyrant and has the decency to listen to his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since this was the first summit meeting of the five great powers, he was more stubborn than usual to avoid being stepped on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was his revenge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was only then that Zang realized his mistake.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Really? No way. But that&rsquo;s crazy, right? How could a mythical character from thousands of years ago exist in the real world!?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And much to his consternation, Zang is confused.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps because he was related to the man who was Rudra, Velgrynd had a soft spot in her heart for Zang.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If this were an unrelated person, the negotiations would have been over long ago. It was more than likely that blood would have been spilled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, Zang didn&rsquo;t realize his good fortune.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">On the contrary</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c16">&mdash;</span><span class="c5 c8">Wait, what? If the mythical goddess is real, then she deserves me! Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s right. If I can have the goddess, all of my problems will be over!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if he had just come up with a brilliant plan of recovery, he did something outrageous.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kukkukku, is that so! O goddess, Velgrynd! Have you crossed time and space to meet me? Love me? Very well. I will return the feeling. I will take you as my wife and swear that I will love you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In front of the crowd he burst into multiple misunderestandings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This confuses Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh? What kind of joke are you making?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be embarrassed. It&rsquo;s wartime now. I can&rsquo;t show you now, but when everything&rsquo;s settled, I&rsquo;ll make you my queen. I heard the emperor didn&rsquo;t have any children with the goddess, but do you think she&rsquo;ll have any with me? If we can bring in the blood of the goddess, Arcia will be ready for a time of further development!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd was speechless at the astonishingly rapid pace in which he was running.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She ad never been so insulted before and was at a loss for words. It&rsquo;s not that she can&rsquo;t keep up with it, or that she didn&rsquo;t want to understand it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was proof that even a person who was good at calculation could lose their heads.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aside from Velgrynd, the audience&rsquo;s reactions were mixed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the people of the &quot;Seven Sacred Vessels&quot; who paled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Stop, stop it, Your Majesty</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c5 c8">!!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One wanted to scream at him, but held back and signaled to the ministers with his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He instinctively knew that this was going to be a terrible thing if nothing was done.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could a man hope to bend the goddess to his will? Zang must be silenced before the goddess&rsquo; punishment was doled out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet the ministers wouldn&rsquo;t act.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or, rather, they couldn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The blank expression on Velgrynd&rsquo;s face made her good looks stand out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it felt very scary.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was because his heart was dependent on his own actions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He couldn&rsquo;t expect the ministers to do anymore.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Seven Sacred Vessels grew impatient and turned to their leader. And so Bright is left to bemoan his misfortune.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Empire was no stranger to this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The bureaucrats of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#39; intelligence department, who were nervous before the meeting, thought that the Emperior of Arcia would not be such a fool.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was gutsy of him, but if Velgrynd got angry, everyone would be collateral damage. They all agreed that they didn&rsquo;t want that to happen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you think? It&rsquo;s a wonderful proposal! Even if you spend the rest of your life, you won&rsquo;t be loved much by an old man who doesn&rsquo;t have much life left in him. I, on the other hand, would spend every night&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The air in the room froze.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone realized that what they had feared had come true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd&rsquo;s anger was taken seriously and Zang went rigid. He realizes his stupidity, but couldn&rsquo;t swallow the words he was saying.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">What!? What the hell is this divine energy!? Mythical Goddess&mdash;this is even more than I imagined. How could I have imagined such a supernatural existence being my queen?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incoherent thoughts flashed through Zang&rsquo;s brain. Then he realized the stupidity of his folly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Taking in the blood of the goddess seemed like a really great idea. That may be true in and of itself, but there are things you can do and things you can&rsquo;t do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the god emperor, who was said to be loved by the goddess, was no match for the goddess to give birth to a son. Even his descendant, Zang, was not even worthy of the goddess&rsquo; favor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the Goddess&rsquo;s character as described in the literature was, even as rumored, quite harsh. She even tried to destroy the country when she someone she loved was insulted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Excavations in the region, following the literature, had uncovered traces of the city&rsquo;s existence in the buried strata. The outer walls of the excavated buildings are reported to have been melted by the ultra-high temperature and turned into glass.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For some reason, Zang remembered such information only now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zang paled as he saw a future where the nations of Arcia would be consumed by the fiery flames. Perhaps he had violated the greatest ban on war, but that&rsquo;s behind him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would have been Zang&rsquo;s complete ruin, but someone made a move.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Yamamoto!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If e allowed Velgrynd to run amok, he would be held fully responsible. Their lives were at stake before that, but that was of secondary importance to Yamamoto.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamamoto was not normally a pompous and hardworking man, but he wasn&rsquo;t so corrupt that he would run away from his responsibilities when the time came. Rather, he knew that someone had to take the blame when the war broke out, and he thought it was his role to do so.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was precisely because of Yamamoto that he was able to act before anyone else when he heard Zang&rsquo;s statement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You idiot! You insult our Emperor! War may be inevitable if things go wrong, but how shall I respond!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Velgrynd could say anything, he jumped out and shouted, &ldquo;No!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">People have a tendency to cool off when others are angry before they are. This also applied to the True Dragon, Velgrynd, and prevented her from bursting into anger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the biggest fine play of the day, Yamamoto Kanji.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And here&rsquo;s the other thing that comes into play.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you making so much noise about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The &nbsp;Emperor, who had profusely been asked for help, arrived just in time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your Majesty&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Ryuo, don&rsquo;t let the young man&rsquo;s words deceive you. Zang-dono must have tried it to see if you&rsquo;re really worthy of trust.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Sakura Akira arrived, he called out to Velgrynd in a calm manner. He was inwardly impatient, and this was the first time in decades that he had run down the corridor, but he showed no sign of that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He really was a majestic champion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing such an Akira Sakura, Velgrynd forgot her anger. She regained her composure and examined the words she was told.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I dared to find out how much anger I would have to get angry, by caressing my emotions against me</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh-huh. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, it was Akira Sakura who wanted to convince Velgrynd. He thought it didn&rsquo;t matter that he was insulted if he could mend the situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For all that, his wish came true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, so that&rsquo;s what happened. I didn&rsquo;t want to think Shin&rsquo;s descendants were that stupid, so that makes sense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd nodded widely and smiled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was so beautiful and gentle, that it relieved Akira Sakura.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now, since the Arcia people are probably tired, you may show them to the waiting room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the moment arises, Akira gives the instructions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Normally, the Emperor wouldn&rsquo;t do this himself, but this was a time where he had no choice. As if the magic was broken, everyone started to work together and the great danger had subsided.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incidentally, in a later version of Arcia&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are many pro-Japanese families, but the Yamamoto surname in particular has become immensely popular.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is even listed in history textbooks as the man who saved Arcia from the crisis.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is described as the friend who admonished the then king Zang&hellip; though Yamamoto never knew about it himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Arcia and her team gone, the atmosphere in the room settles down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emperor had gone back to his room to take some stomach pills, so Velgrynd decided to resume her work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s been a long time since anyone&rsquo;s tested me. Zang, is it? It&rsquo;s just like Shin&rsquo;s descendants, you&rsquo;ve grown up in an interesting way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. Haha, I&rsquo;m surprised too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me, thinks Yamamoto, but he&rsquo;s not bad. He&rsquo;s gaining the trust of his subordinates, so he&rsquo;s just hoping they&rsquo;ll put up with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Well, now, the only thing left is</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We are a nation of harmony.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is an ally of the Empire and has finally agreed to participate on the condition that other nations join the talks. Velgrynd does not know much about them, as she has not negotiated directly with them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time they have invited the President of the People&rsquo;s Republic, several leaders of the government, plus their personal bodyguards.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They confronted Velgrynd with a stunned stare.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Turning his gaze sharply to Velgrynd, the President of the People&rsquo;s Republic opens his mouth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My name is Wang Longren. Are you Ryuo-dono?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmph! It looks just like a human. But we won&rsquo;t be fooled. Demon, have we entered the empire of your allies? Or is it just a trick to make us think so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wang Longren called out Velgrynd with hostility. The bureaucrats are puzzled by this, while Velgrynd herself thinks, &ldquo;Not again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From Wang Longren&rsquo;s reaction, it was clear that something was up. Until she finds out, Velgrynd decides it&rsquo;s best not to speak out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where this is, but I dared to jump into the tiger&rsquo;s den. Don&rsquo;t grow up and think your plan worked, demon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as Wang Longren shouted this, the guards from China moved in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were dressed in white robes that looked easy to move in. It was clear from their refined movements that they were experts in the martial arts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that didn&rsquo;t matter to Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I recognize your formidable power, demon. But I will not permit you to speak that name!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Exactly! The very name of the man who supposedly guided Long-sama, the founder of Dragon Fist, is not worthy of being spoken by a demon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The warriors shouted in a fiery rage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reaction from the empire was somewhat cold.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone was left thinking,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Here we go again.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s definitely her,&rsquo; the bureaucrats all thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so did Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Long? You know, that guy named his technique as &lsquo;Dragon Fist.&rsquo; Well, Long lived in this world too. So you guys are Long&rsquo;s disciples and have inherited his mastery of the art? That&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd had studied the history of this world, but of course she did not know all of the historical figures. It is impossible for the Empire to have information on the secrets of kung fu that other countries keep.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s no wonder Velgrynd was unaware of Long&rsquo;s, the Dragon Fist founder&rsquo;s, existence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But for the Chinese, this is a situation that they can&rsquo;t understand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you pretending to be convinced of?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you trying to cheat? But that&rsquo;s not very nice. We&rsquo;re the best of the best, and we will destroy you here and crush your ambitions!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;After all, you werer first. You who deceived us with your precious name, let us destroy you and regain the pride of our country!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shouting this, the warriors took up a battle position.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing this, Velgrynd smiled happily.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh my, for a human from this world, your fighting spirit is very skilled. You&rsquo;ve been training hard and improving yourself. I&rsquo;m glad to see that you are learning Long&rsquo;s teachings so well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The way Velgrynd looked at the warriors was no longer the same as the way she looked at her enemies, but rather a master&rsquo;s gaze on their beloved disciple. That temperature difference was causing the warriors to grow angry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you think you can fool us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. If this happens, then all at once</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The warriors tried to rely on force, but someone stopped them. Only one of them was a small figure wearing a black long robe with a dragon embroidered on it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop it! I&rsquo;m the only match for her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The person with a transparent and clear voice was a beautiful dark-haired, dark-eyed girl.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Xia-Xianhua-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The warriors were about to argue in anger, but when they saw that person&mdash;Fist Saint Xianhua&mdash;they kept their mouths shut.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was because the strongest Fist Saint, who was always calm and collected and looked cool no matter what kind of enemy she was facing, was sweating and nervous.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once she said that, there was no one to talk back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re the heir. That&rsquo;s an impressive display of fighting spirit, I&rsquo;ll give you that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. I am the Fist Saint who has inherited the spirit from the Fist Saint of old. If you are indeed the Dragon Phoenix-sama (Ryuo), will you give me the honor of your guidance?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ll do you the honor of coaching you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, the story suddenly came together.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1128.82px;"><img alt="IMAGE SHOW ME A GOOD TIME, JACK" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1128.82px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was decided to watch the outcome of the battle without any chance for the others to interrupt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Needless to say, the result was an overwhelming victory for Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or rather, it wasn&rsquo;t even a match, but only Xianhua knew that it was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the eyes of the others, it looked like Xianhua was attacking unilaterally. Even those who were studying Dragon Fist felt that Xianhua, with her fists and feet, had cornered Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Dragon Fist was not a bloodline, and all the profound secrets would be passed down to the one with the highest skill among the disciples.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most important skill to be inherited was the one Xianhua spoke of&mdash;spirit. This was a forbidden ritual that required one to record every move they learned and pass it on to his successor. Moreover, a portion of his spirit was also inherited, so the quality and quantity of the fighting spirit was increased rapidly!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not always possible for the successor to learn all of the powers and techniques, but as long as spirit was passed down, there was hope for the next generation. And so Long retired, hoping that one day the strongest fist fighter would be born.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such is the history that led to the birth of Xianhua, the Fist Saint who deserves the name of the strongest fighter in the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had completely fused her inherited spirit and her own vitality to bring all her skills and power to herself. As a result, she had reached a level of strength that was foreign to this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">More than 100,000 in existence value.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the Cardinal World, where Velgrynd was born, she was an overwhelmingly powerful human, even to the point of being classified as an Immortal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this world, she was unmatched, but this time, it was just too bad. Xianhua was easily beaten by Velgrynd and suffered a defeat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh-huh. That was a great strength. Definitely stronger than Gensei, and in this world, you would have beaten Kondou as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though she was defeated, Xianhua still felt refreshed. She could forget her doubts about Velgrynd and admit that she was the real thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Velgrynd was also extremely happy to know that her beloved Long&rsquo;s wishes had been carried on. She has very fond feelings for Long&rsquo;s disciples, led by Xianhua.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now she is willing to give them a mythical-grade or two unconditionally. It never happened, but there was no doubt that Velgrynd was pleased.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A lot had happened, but now the heads of state are all here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All the leaders from China, except President Wang Longren, were substitutes who were disguised as fists. They thought it was a demon&rsquo;s trap, so the Imperialists thought it was inevitable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve been replaced by the real ones now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if you ask about their situation, it&rsquo;s a common story.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;re hostages.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only on a national scale.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The phantoms in China began their activities by going after the leaders&rsquo; children. By building relationships, making connections, reaching out to targets. Then they brainwashed them and took them back to their base.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Teachers, co-workers, superiors, family members. Little by little, they possessed them and achieved 70% of the goal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why the invasion of the United States of Azalea was unanimously approved by the National People&rsquo;s Congress.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think an apology will suffice, but I hope you understand that it was not our intention either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Wang Longren bows.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To which George responds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay. I understand that each country has its own set of circumstances. I have a son that got taken away. When I put my family and my country on a scale, there&rsquo;s only one choice. And it&rsquo;s my responsibility as president, but I&rsquo;m not going to give up until the end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hm. I&rsquo;m sorry for your loss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">George and Wang Longren nodded at each other.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you say so, I apologize too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So says Magellan, the Great Roziam Emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The military is out of control and invading China. There is nothing to stop this, Magellan himself has admitted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In that case, that makes me guilty too. Our invasion of the Great Roziam Dynasty, a fool&rsquo;s errand of the devil&rsquo;s own making. I can now admit as much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was an uncharacteristic attitude of the Emperor Zang.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Zang was saved by Yamamoto and Akira Sakura, he calmed down in the waiting room. When he calmed down, he realized how dangerous what he had done was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zang is not incompetent. He had the presence of mind to acknowledge the situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he had consulted with the other Seven Vessels.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Emperor&rsquo;s sword is now the fourth seat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;One of the Seven had never returned from his incursion into Roziam. That&rsquo;s why it has come to our attention.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The one who went missing was a woman who, eager to do battle, submitted a plan of action and moved her troops on her own without waiting for a decision from headquarters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was a clear violation of military discipline.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The national war potential of the Seven Sacred Vessels invading another country without waiting for Emperor&rsquo;s order is an unavoidable problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had always been against starting a war. But lately, she showed a sudden change of heart.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her attitude had puzzled everyone involved and was reason enough to be suspicious. The fact that she was acting on her own, and despite the fact that she was a heroic member of the &ldquo;seven vessels,&rdquo; she was the target of the investigation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, they still hadn&rsquo;t found conclusive evidence that the demon had taken over, but they had come to the conclusion that they had no choice but to admit it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were convinced because their pride was broken.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The match between Velgrynd and Xianhua took place in the courtyard, but it was clearly visible from the waiting room.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd had treated Xianhua like a baby, as if she couldn&rsquo;t win even with all the Seven Vessels working together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the Seven Vessels saw this, they saw no point in being overbearing. So did Zang, who had given up on his ambition to unify the world through the Holy Arcia Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Huh, now I remember. Whoever has the goddess&rsquo;s blessing will be king of the world. If that is the truth&hellip; then the ruler of our time is Lord Akira Sakura.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because Zang understood that, he became fully compliant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like that, there was an apology battle by the nations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I, too&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, no, no, no, I understand the position of the empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. And as for the United States, I regret that we were forced to make a choice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Akira Sakura tried to join in, but he was cut off by Wang Longren and George, who cut him off immediately.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamamoto and others who had been standing upright by the wall observing the meeting were able to understand what the leaders were thinking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Well, if they say His Majesty is to be blamed here, I&rsquo;m sure his people will be displeased.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yamamoto glanced at Velgrynd, thinking that she would make the same judgment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the apology battle was over, the scene is redrawn.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In earnest, a strategy for the demons was being planned, but all eyes were on Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, Ryuo-dono, what kind of strategy do you think is effective against demons?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the Army Minister&rsquo;s statement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a shameful question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a military leader who protects the empire, there should be no other power application.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time, no one was blaming him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the contrary, the other leaders were ready to wait for Velgrynd&rsquo;s answer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was inevitable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are powerless against an enemy beyond human understanding.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While all eyes are on Velgrynd, their only hope, she is at ease. As if to say, &ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; she turned to the speaker.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You understand that sending an army out is pointless, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Reluctantly, of course. It makes sense in terms of keeping the fleet off the mainland, but there&rsquo;s no such thing as a fleet battle. Even if each ship is manned by people gathered here, it will be impossible to resist the demons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Army Minister was right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they came close to the mainland, the cities would be targeted by gunfire. It makes sense to build a maritime defense line to stop them, but it would be useless if they had no chance to win anyway.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whether or not the demon will destroy the city is also unknown.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they have the power to possess humanity, there&rsquo;s a good chance they&rsquo;ll use the city as is. Then there would be no reason to challenge the fleet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd nodded and replied.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Firearms don&rsquo;t work against demons, and ordinary soldiers aren&rsquo;t much help. So, we are left with two choices.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Either you leave it all up to me, or you can try to do a little bit of work on your own.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd&rsquo;s statement was humiliating to the proud soldiers. But the truth is they couldn&rsquo;t even argue with that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The brave men and women gathered here look at each other for a reaction. And by the keenness of their eyes, they had come to the same conclusion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The imperial swordsman, Araki Gensei, and Minamoto Saburo, broke the ice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is our problem, you know. I have no desire to speak of poor pride&hellip; but relying on Ryuo-dono all the time is shameful. If there&rsquo;s anything I can do, I&rsquo;ll challenge him with my life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I feel the same way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arcia&rsquo;s seven sacred vessels follow suit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want it to be just the men of the Empire. We wish to join you on this mission.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;His Majesty Zang is out of the question. I want us to handle it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. His Majesty can only do his duty if he survives. Leave it to us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leaving Zang behind, six men have declared for war.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, Chinese Fist Saint Xianhua announced her decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you protect mankind, Ryuo-sama, we will fear no man. Even if we are defeated, you have promised us a great victory. Please give us the opportunity to grow, even though we are so small.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xianhua bowed reverently.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nine warriors came forward, but there was also one more person who came forward at the end.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, may I come along with you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was interrupted by Billy, the head of the U.S. Secret Service. He is a combat professional who came to the scene as George&rsquo;s bodyguard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is a young man of twenty-eight, with a scar on his cheek. He is also proficient in magic and uses his own special gun bullets.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he was inferior to these nine men.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not to mention his physical prowess&hellip;his weapons were also not too much to talk about.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m better than others who have given up on their own, but when it comes to being an asset, I&rsquo;m not that good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Billy, aware of this, waits nervously for an answer from Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">George joins in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Billy is a very good man to be my bodyguard. He&rsquo;s saved my life a lot of times, and I miss Emile. I&rsquo;ll give up if it&rsquo;s too much trouble, but you can take him with you if you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without a good bodyguard, he was more likely to be in danger. But doing nothing was not an option when humanity&rsquo;s survival was at stake.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Billy could go head to head with the lower-ranked demons. Believing that, he offered to increase their strength.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They will gather all of humanity&rsquo;s strength to attack the demon&rsquo;s stronghold. They would destroy what Velgrynd called the Underworld Gates and remove the threat of the invaders from the root.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And everyone was prepared to die for it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, Velgrynd laughs serenely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you chose to leave it up to me here, I was only going to protect what I wanted to protect. But it&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;re all willing to do it. I&rsquo;ll give you a little help with that resolve.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Velgrynd had seriously planned to abandon humanity if the former was the answer to this question. She was even willing to emigrate to another world, taking only Akira and George with her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Goddesses are fickle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The representatives of humanity made the right choice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, Velgrynd responded to that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Billy. I&rsquo;ll allow you to join us. I can&rsquo;t say no to that. And you&rsquo;re just as strong as everyone else in there. With those weapons, you&rsquo;ll have plenty of strength to add to your arsenal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd ordered Minamoto and Billy to produce their weapons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Velgrynd ordered Minamoto to bring his sword and Billy to bring his favorite S &amp; WM </span><span class="c28">&#12887;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Magnum Revolver). Velgrynd takes them and, without a second thought, transformed them into mythical-grade weapons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Th-this is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minamoto and Billy are stupefied when their beloved weapons are returned to them, which have gotten visibly more dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei had experienced it once, so he wasn&rsquo;t as surprised. He just nodded with a nonchalant look on his face. The others, however, were not the same, and were stunned by the fact that the Seven Vessels, who knew what they were, could not understand how such a weapon could be so easily transported to another country!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it&rsquo;s true that their strength was also reliable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was not the time to ask Velgrynd to carry their weight, so Sakura Akira could only watch.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It will be better if you use it. But I want you to keep in mind that only Xianhua is really an asset. You are called Bright, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, you. You&rsquo;re the best at what you do, but you still haven&rsquo;t drawn three percent of the mythical-grade weapon&rsquo;s power. The others are out of the question. They&rsquo;re only at one to two percent, and they can do better if they try their best.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they could truly harness the power of the mythical-grade weapons, they would be able to awaken as a spirit life form and defeat most demons. But with their current strength, this awakening was impossible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd only made the artifacts available to those of Shin&rsquo;s blood when she created them. They could be used, but they were nowhere near as powerful as they should be.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there&rsquo;s no need to be ashamed of that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This world is weak in magic and fragile in every way. If they could cross the realm and have their bodies reshaped, they would be able to rise above Sage. As for Xianhua, there is a strong possibility that she will awaken as Saint.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that&rsquo;s why the warriors are now ready.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And with this, the great counterattack has begun.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">The demon (youma)</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">Delia strolls through the Great Roziam Palace.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a human, Delia was the fourth seat of the Seven Vessels.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That day, Delia was assigned an important mission. A demon calling himself Emile was behind the sabotage and she was on a mission to stop him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was a trap set by Emile.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the intelligence officer had fallen into Emile&rsquo;s hands, and his goal was to lure Delia out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia was defeated by Emile.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fully armed, Delia tried, but Emile, who had a rough appearance, played her, and beat her to a pulp.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was humiliating.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">But more than that</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the first time in her life, Delia, the strongest of mankind, was terrified.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Putting aside her shame and ignorance, Delia begged for her life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emile smiled softly and said, &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she didn&rsquo;t know what that meant until it was too late.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia has been stripped of her knowledge, her position, and even her name, and is now completely reborn as a demon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia&rsquo;s rank was the same as Li Jinlong and David, the &ldquo;general&rdquo; rank.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She went to war at the same time as the Arcia invasion of the Great Roziam and was involved in the mission to destroy it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first objective of the demon invasion was to secure the territory.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the second objective was to enslave mankind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was to ensure their dependents would be possess the families.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not just anyone, but a body strong enough to withstand the changes caused by the magical element. This is where selection is important.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As half-mental life forms, demons do not need to eat even if they possess people. It&rsquo;s not that they can&rsquo;t eat, or that they can get sustenance from food, but it&rsquo;s okay if they don&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the greater the body to be possessed, the better. So they sought a way to control humanity from the ground up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A plan was devised to destroy the five great powers whose conditions were the most unfavorable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was Roziam.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most of its land was unsuitable for development.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Harsh conditions have made their soldiers strong, but the land was no longer needed for the state.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason for leaving the royal family in the territory is to entrust the management of the land and the people. But with Great Roziam no longer needed, there is no longer any sense in preserving the lineage of the Roziam dynasty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demon does not intend to kill all of Great Roziam&rsquo;s people. She believes that destroying the Great Roziam Royals will bring down the existing system of state.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is why Mystery Monk Pulcinella is encouraging his people to stage a coup and Delia is following suit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Walking around the palace, Delia let out a sickening sigh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked everywhere and saw no sign of Great Roziam&rsquo;s royalty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Roziam Emperor and his family.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same goes for the government officials and their families.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition to the knights who worked in the palace, their maidservants and attendants have disappeared. She searched everywhere for hidden passageways, but found no evidence of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She possessed one of the men to read the memories of those who know the castle, but there was no sign of them. In this situation, there was no choice but to assume that they had disappeared.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is said by Delia&rsquo;s colleague, Emile. Now that they were on a par with each other, the banter was casual.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I have no idea where the Roziam Emperor has gone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re in trouble. I don&rsquo;t think they can do &lsquo;Spatial Manipulation&rsquo; as well as we can&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pfft, they can&rsquo;t. That is an act of God for the mortals in this world. None of the Seven could have teleported them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia affirmed that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her memories of being a strong being in this world make her sure of that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magic is scarce, so no one knows how to use it, and there is no elemental magic in this world. There is the Extra Skill &lsquo;Spatial Movement&rsquo; that Delia now has access to, but only a few people can dive the portal at the same time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no way they could have escaped from a palace that was completely surrounded by them. It was supposed to be impossible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because Emile was the most physically gifted among those gathered recently, he had been given the rank of &lsquo;general&rsquo; demon. He is too weak to be the strongest man in the world, Delia guessed, and has no knowledge of such things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His body is stronger and his knowledge of this world is greater than hers. Remembering that, Delia feels a little bit better.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then there was a hole in the siege, but my gut tells me that&rsquo;s not the case. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m overlooking something very important, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saying this thoughtfully, Emile turns to Delia&rsquo;s spear. The spear, which is said to have been created by a goddess, is the origin of the name &ldquo;Seven Sacred Vessels.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For some reason, the sight of the spear made Emile feel nostalgic. He has no idea what the reason was, but he thought the answer might be in his memory.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demons can read the memories of possessed humans.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, aside from important knowledge, things that were repeated on a daily basis, such as an ordinary conversation, were too voluminous and took too long to scrutinize. Most of it was usually ignored because they couldn&rsquo;t spend the effort on something that didn&rsquo;t mean much.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emile was no exception; he knew his status, his skills, his relationships at work, and his duties, but he ignored the memories of his childhood.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why he could only remember the word &ldquo;Gryn-neechan&rdquo; about the beautiful woman beside his grandfather. If he had known it was Velgrynd, he would have decided that this was the most important thing and would have advised to rethink the entire operation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">That spear is really bothering me. Maybe Emile, whose body I was in, had something to do with that spear. I&rsquo;m going to have to search my memory.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emile is worried about the uneasiness that won&rsquo;t go away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though he doesn&rsquo;t think it had anything to do with the escape of the Roziam Emperor and the others, he began to search his memory to relieve his fears.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In contrast to Emile, Delia is confident.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh well. It&rsquo;s no use caring about the people who got away. They can&rsquo;t win against us anyway, so let&rsquo;s just ignore them and go on with our plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The plan was to hold the royal family hostage and call in the elite of this country, but&hellip;let&rsquo;s scrap that. Instead, how about we let this palace go up in flames and make the demise of the Great Roziam Dynasty known?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Originally, they would have announced the public execution of the royal family, thus accelerating the madness of the people of Roziam. They had hoped to lure the heroes to stop them and replace them with their own people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if possible, they wanted to secure Fist Saint Xianhua, who was considered to be the strongest in the world, not just in China.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because of the difference in countries, whether Xianhua would move or not was a gamble. So the failure of this strategy wasn&rsquo;t too bad of a blow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the Great Roziam Dynasty was in chaos, the next target was China. Xianhua would come out when the time came anyway, so it was not a problem if they went for Xianhua.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once Xianhua was secured, this world would be under control. Delia smirked. &nbsp;It was that simple.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">But then.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mystery Monk Pulcinella sent an urgent telepathic message.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can you hear me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is this Pulcinella-sama? Did you take the trouble to contact me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. There was a mysterious report from one of my men who had sent me to China first. I had them look for the Chinese leaders, but none of them could be found.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What did you say!? You think the humans can deceive us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">No, I think not. I thought it might be some kind of magic trick that only exists in this world, but I don&rsquo;t think it would work against a high-ranking officer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I agree with you. The low-level people of this world are of no threat to us, no matter how much they try.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia couldn&rsquo;t believe that she had been misled, and that it was the same for her subordinates as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Judging from her memories of her time as a human, even the Seventh Sacred Vessel level was only at the lower middle level.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was unthinkable for Xianhua to fall behind the others.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Pulcinella chided Delia.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself, Delia! This is the material world. You don&rsquo;t know what kind of change you can cause by giving one magic. I feel my strength growing every day. This is proof that this body is superior. Only in this body can we demons attain perfection. Don&rsquo;t you dare to forget that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Angered, Delia was reminded of the truth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a lesser world in terms of strength alone, but that&rsquo;s because the laws of the world are different. Delia cautioned her mind that she must not forget her position until the invasion was complete.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir. A reprimand, I am well aware of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Haha! So, we&rsquo;re going to get started, but there&rsquo;s actually a problem on our end as well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now is the time for Delia to give her report.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were going to capture the royalty, but no one was there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the same situation in China that Pulcinella had told her about, and she couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What, you think it&rsquo;s the same phenomenon in Roziam? I can see the palace from my vantage point, but I don&rsquo;t see anything unusual. Or is this an oversight? I don&rsquo;t know, but something bad has happened&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia agrees with the idea that something bad is happening.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emile, who was standing next to her listening to the telepathic message, looked just as nervous as Delia.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait a moment. I will discuss this with Amari Masahiko.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella avoided drawing conclusions on his own.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a miracle that the sharpest man in Cornu&rsquo;s camp, the Chief of Staff, is now in the hands of one of the best minds in the world. It was only natural for Pulcinella, who was also a member of the &ldquo;chief of staff,&rdquo; to hear an opinion from such a man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the conclusion he comes to is&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is a withdrawal. If something unforeseen occurs, all operational actions must be frozen. We will rendezvous on the Atlantis continent to formulate a more careful plan. Do you have any objections?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia answers immediately.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no doubt to Emile</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the demons had to abort their mission and gather at their home base.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Amari Mashiko received the report from Pulcinella, he understood that the situation was not looking good.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were invincible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Not only as demons</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span class="c0">, but from the knowledge and power they had gained when they were human, they should have been one step closer to taking over this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After conquering mankind, they will reveal Cornu to the world. After doing so, they plan to modify the planet and use it as a stepping-stone for further invasions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The universe is vast, but not as vast as the other worlds. They thought that if they had gained a relying spirit and incarnated themselves, they could completely conquer this space-time within a few thousand to tens of thousands of years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, they had developed the Underworld Gate, which leads to other dimensions, and had their sights set on a further invasion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then, an unforeseen event occurred.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a definite element of uncertainty, judged Amari Masahiko.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, what shall we do now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong and David responded as he uttered that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There seems to be a lot on your mind. I thought everything was fine, is there a problem?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking at the pair, Masahiko looks at them and explains the situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Roziam royalty and the leaders from China have gone into hiding. The cause is unknown, and some forces are suspected to have intervened.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wahaha, don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s overthinking it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmmm, there are definitely some uncertainties, but is it enough that we have to interrupt the operation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong laughed without a problem. David also thought that this was a bit too weak.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that doesn&rsquo;t change Amari Masahiko&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;re strong, but we&rsquo;re not all-powerful. Be aware that the slightest carelessness can derail the entire strategy. Now is the time to gather all the information we can. Contact those remaining in the three countries and assess the situation. Find out thoroughly what the other top brass are doing in the other countries.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that order, the place was dismissed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After they left, Amari Masahiko surrendered to the chair in his office and was lost in thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arcia doesn&rsquo;t have any of the seven vessels below the emperor&rsquo;s clan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is the United States. We&rsquo;ve lost contact with the president and his entourage. I have no record of them going out, but there is no sign of them in the White House.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Although it is an empire, security is high. We tried to break into the place of administration, including the imperial palace, but it was impossible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even before David and the others were ordered to do so, he was already working with his handlers. Whenever there was something on his mind, he would act immediately.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then what he heard was, of course, what he needed to hear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Forget the United States and Arcia, I&rsquo;m interested in the Empire. We have the lieutenant in charge of our intelligence. Gensei might be able &nbsp;to handle him&hellip;no, he couldn&rsquo;t. Anyway, he&rsquo;s not that adept at covert action.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei is the master of Amari Mssahiko, and his swordsmanship is top-notch. But as a sorcerer, he is a novice, and without him, the Royal Guard Corps would have a difficult time dealing with the demon&rsquo;s dark activities.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demon was discovered in a forcible infiltration attempt. It would be understandable if a battle ensued.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This isn&rsquo;t the case.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they couldn&rsquo;t even break in, then this was a very unusual situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see what we can do about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He asked Pulcinella and the others to come back as soon as they&rsquo;ve dealt with the situation, so they&rsquo;ll teleport back. By then, David and his team will know what&rsquo;s going on, and they&rsquo;ll discuss the future strategy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not about such matters that troubled Masahiko.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Who am I?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The human-born Amari Masahiko was possessed by a &ldquo;mastermind&rdquo; level demon. His assimilation rate isn&rsquo;t perfect, but he can use his powers to their fullest extent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s not the case.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was a rival to Kondou.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were best friends and rival&mdash;so it&rsquo;s no wonder his spirit was strong enough to reach the ultimate goal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is precisely because of this that Masahiko thinks about his own existence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is he really a demon?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or perhaps&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Humans in this world do not have the aid of a universal substance called magic. That&rsquo;s why they are vulnerable, but their minds are free and their spirits are infinitely strong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phantoms, on the other hand, are often called angels who used to serve seraphim. They were like machines that only did what they were told, such as angels of the dominion class and below.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why their egos are so thin, and that&rsquo;s why they can&rsquo;t afford to be taken over by others.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">If the human will breaks the phantom&rsquo;s ego, the order will be lost.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was precisely because Masahiko anticipates this that he was troubled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a demon, he believes that resurrecting Cornu is the best thing for him. He should do his best for that and get rid of all obstacles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the current Amari Masahiko had a different opinion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Postponement on the expansion of the Underworld Gate. Instead&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Once it&rsquo;s destroyed, am I the king? No, kings are a pain in the ass, so I can leave it to Pulcinella. Isn&rsquo;t it better for us humans to rule this world, rather than allowing demons and other invaders to rule it?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had that grandiose idea in his mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wonders if this phenomenon was only happening to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A high-ranking general class demon remembers that he was originally a cherub.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was born to the god Veldanava, the Star King Dragon, to serve Cornu.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, even though he was comparable to an Awakened Demon Lord in the Otherworld, he was now wavering about his own existence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as he was an example of himself, Amari Masahiko, he couldn&rsquo;t let his guard down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He must assume that the others were as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, then who is an ally and who is an enemy&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How is it best to organize them and how is it best to act?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whether or not Pulcinella is the right choice for the king is also an unanswerable question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is not enough material to make a decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Masahiko reserved his conclusion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, the report came in that everyone was present.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, as it turns out, all the heads of state and government have disappeared?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To be exact, it would appear that some of them are still around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth considering. Seeing that the people who are in charge of determining national policy have gathered in the Imperial State, we should consider that humanity is also showing a full-fledged counter-offensive attitude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mm. I won&rsquo;t argue with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the two apex men agreed that that was the answer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then shall we move our fleet toward the Empire?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s an open secret that there is an outpost here on the Atlantis continent. The humans know this too, and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve been lured here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soldiers are better suited to take the place of demons than civilians.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Instead of kidnapping them, it&rsquo;s better to have them come to them. That was the plan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But now that there is unrest in the land, that&rsquo;s a different story.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seemed to be reasonably effective to launch a grand offensive and wait and see what happens&hellip;but Masahiko felt uneasy as if he had overlooked some important factor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This world is within reach and the reason for that is that there are no strong men.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But was that really the case?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If this assumption was wrong, then the strategy would need to be reexamined from the ground up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want to reiterate. I want each of you to mobilize all your knowledge and make sure. Aree there really no other powerful beings in this world?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Masahiko asks that question, Li Jinlong replies with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about it. The only one who is a threat is Xianhua!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that assertion, he became even more worried.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait. Then who trained this Xianhua?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;According to my research, Xianhua has learned the Dragon Fist, a martial art that is passed down from one generation to the next. She is said to have inherited a skill that is unknown to the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s stronger than ordinary people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How did that martial art come about? The founder is said to be a man named Long. Do you have any information about this man?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When asked that, Li Jinlong recalls. Although he was not chosen as the successor, he was one of the best members who studied the Dragon Fist. That&rsquo;s why he had been drilled with knowledge of the Founder.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I believe the book of secrets states that a woman named the Dragon Phoenix (Ryuo) guided our Founder, but it&rsquo;s only a biography of an oral history. I don&rsquo;t see any point in that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;Hmm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Masahiko had a bad feeling about this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Normally he shouldn&rsquo;t be misled by such a vague biography&hellip;but he can&rsquo;t help but feel uneasy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now that you mention it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia says what she&rsquo;s remembered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arcia also had a myth of a goddess who guided the Emperor&rsquo;s ancestors&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing that, Masahiko felt uneasy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia&rsquo;s face paled and she was sweating from the nerviousness. Since she became a demon, Delia hadn&rsquo;t been affected by her emotions like a human, but the enormity of what she remembered frightened her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is this goddess&rsquo; name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Caldina</span><span class="c9">&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">It is believed that she took the name Cardinal, which means crimson, but it was said that &lsquo;Caldina&rsquo; was established as a nickname.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The word &ldquo;Cardinal&rdquo; sounded familiar.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Scorch Dragon&rdquo; Velgrynd used to call herself that because of the color of her aura, and Masahiko had found that out from his knowledge of the demons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">It&rsquo;s a coincidence. &ldquo;The Scorch Dragon Velgrynd, like Feldway-sama, is supposed to be in the Cardinal World. I hear that she was with Emperor Rudra and has no idea of our true purpose. She couldn&rsquo;t possibly be in this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to talk to the Phantom King Feldway, even though he was Cornu&rsquo;s chief of staff. So, from hearsay, the operation in the &ldquo;Cardinal World&rdquo; was going well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Scorch Dragon Velgrynd is at Rudra&rsquo;s beck and call, and I can assure you that she will never leave Rudra&rsquo;s side. So it is unthinkable that she would be in this world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, the doubt of whether it is true can&rsquo;t get out of his mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia&rsquo;s pallor also suggested that the story didn&rsquo;t end there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, is that all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s what he asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The answer was Delia&rsquo;s spear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is a divine object supposedly created by the goddess. It contains a terrifying amount of power, but even I can&rsquo;t use it now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;&ldquo;</span><span class="c9">&mdash;!!</span><span class="c0">!&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That statement not only upset Amari Masahiko&hellip;but the others as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is only natural that a demon general should be able to use a Legendary-grade weapon as well as a limb. If they can&rsquo;t do that, it proves that their weapons are mythical-grade weapons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In this world where magic is scarce, how can a mythical-grade weapon be created? Moreover, it is said that there is not just one mythical-grade tools, but twelve in the beginning. I&rsquo;m familiar with the sacred artifacts of my former colleagues, and I feel that they were the equivalent of my spear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So that means there are twelve mythical-grade tools, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes&hellip;But I don&rsquo;t think those guys could get more than a few percent of the performance out of it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;d like to say out loud that that&rsquo;s not the problem. However, that would not be a solution, so Amari Masahiko told them something else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What matters is the fact that there was a being that could create mythical-grade weapons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No way! It&rsquo;s really a mythical-grade!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool. You should think twice before you speak.

Even Velgrynd!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on, Emile?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emile, who was always aloof and easygoing, was behaving strangely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seemed to be oblivious to his surroundings and began mumbling to himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was not the action of &nbsp;a demon, but a human being, and it was an instinct of Emile&rsquo;s. The others, who didn&rsquo;t realize it, watched with bated breath to see if Emile was onto something.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. She&rsquo;s here, she&rsquo;s in this world!

Seizing the opportunity, Emile, as a human, fought back desperately.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The memory of the smile of a beautiful woman who loved him like a grandmother, like a mother, like a sister, haunts his mind. It is the memory of an embrace that gives him absolute security.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The name of the woman who held his young self to her breast, was Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so Emile called her name.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To ask for all the help he could get.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Help me, Gryn nee-chan</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emile&rsquo;s exclamation was the key to the sudden change.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You called me, Emile-chan. I&rsquo;m here to help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he said this, a figure appeared out of nowhere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was unreasonable as it happened in the demon&rsquo;s high vigilance stronghold.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The one who was there was Velgrynd. The demons&rsquo; &lsquo;barrier&rsquo; was nothing compared to her ability to destroy even the Labyrinth of Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No wonder the demons were stunned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the cool-headed and collected Amari Masahiko was not expecting this. He was certain of Velgrynd&rsquo;s existence, but he never thought that he would have an encounter before he had time to deal with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Velgrynd, why are you here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know my name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be working with our king, Feldway-sama, to help Emperor Rudra achieve supremacy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh. If you&rsquo;re connected to the Cardinal World, you should be able to synchronize the timelines.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the story I&rsquo;m talking about. I&rsquo;d rather just get this over with, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amari Masahiko was confused.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, the calm part of him continued to think.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he&rsquo;d been aware of Velgrynd&rsquo;s existence earlier, he would have been able to deal with it. But he never imagined she&rsquo;d be in this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">It&rsquo;s a shame. But why? There&rsquo;s no way a being like her can move between dimensions. Even the Underworld Gate, which we&rsquo;ve been working so hard to expand, still can&rsquo;t call Cornu-sama.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The existence of Velgrynd is equal to or greater than Cornu&rsquo;s. It holds an enormous amount of magicules that cannot be seen through normal eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So how did she come to this world?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he didn&rsquo;t know what her purpose was and was at a loss for words.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he could, he would want to avoid hostility at this point.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, however&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a simple proposal. End your invasion of this world and retreat to the other side. And I&rsquo;ll let you off the hook just this once.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd smiles, but her words hide her anger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd hates those who try to hurt her loved ones.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Amari Masahiko accurately perceives that feeling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">That&rsquo;s too bad, I guess we&rsquo;re already enemies. But I don&rsquo;t understand. I thought they were allies of Feldway-sama&hellip;no, wait? A timline synchronization?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The formidable mind of Masahiko spins at high speed. And from the edges of the words Velgrynd leaked, he was able to come up with the correct answer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">So, this person is from a different timeline. She seemed unaware of our situation, but she did not seem surprised by Feldway-sama and Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s story. So I can assume that she knows what we know so far. Judging from the lack of change in orders from Cornu-sama, something must have happened in the future. So perhaps&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She jumped from the Cardinal World to this world&rsquo;s past.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the reasoning that Amari Masahiko gave.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a brilliant mind to admire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was just a shame there wasn&rsquo;t time to put it to use.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There will be no bargaining. It&rsquo;s too much work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the reason why he must make a decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd is at ease, holding out her hand to Emile, whom she had drawn in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was obvious what she was doing. She is carefully separating Emile from the demon that was on the verge of complete assimilation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demon is fighting back, but it is only a matter of time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he&rsquo;d just have to make the most of that time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s what Masahiko decided.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Our desire is for demons and humanity to coexist and prosper together. It&rsquo;s a shame you can&rsquo;t understand that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know, intelligent life forms don&rsquo;t understand what they want one way or the other.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh, no doubt. But we can&rsquo;t give up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s your answer?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd laughs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool. Then</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">it&rsquo;s time to go guys!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The final battle was about to begin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demons&rsquo; eyes widened at the sudden appearance of the humans.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the same can be said for those who have appeared.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The human race&rsquo;s greatest warriors were even more confused than the demons were.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m being summoned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have to go. And we have to help him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then Velgrynd suddenly disappeared.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as they were wondering, they, too, were suddenly summoned to a strange place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is the scene.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">None of them realized that they had shifted through space. After all, they didn&rsquo;t even go through the portal, they just suddenly changed scenery.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It could be summed up in one word, &lsquo;Instantaneous Movement.&rsquo; It could normally only be done by ten people, and it was an unimaginable supernatural power.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To humanity, led by Gensei and the others, it was an act of God that was incomprehensible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In such a situation, even if you are told, &ldquo;It&#39;s your turn, you guys!,&rdquo; It&#39;s a hard to know what to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is important to find out what you can do when you are in trouble like this. This is also applicable to work, and if you take what you can understand as a starting point, you can work your way through it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this case, it was just a lucky thing that they had an acquaintance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Each of them found their own face and began to negotiate with one another.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Gensei&rsquo;s case, he turned to his apprentice and trusted companion, the man who had been his disciple and companion, Amari Masahiko.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Masahiko, you are not a weak man to be dominated by a demon. His Majesty is grieving too. Pick yourself up and get back here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei called out to him and decided to take a look at him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With his hand on the hilt of his sword, he takes a ready-made stance and waits for an answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minamoto follows suit, naturally lining up beside him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose, Masahiko-san, please don&rsquo;t lose! Don&rsquo;t lose sight of your own heart!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like Gensei, he took the same strategy to call out to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was betting on the possibility that they might still have the ego, and hoped that he could overcome the demon&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The person who was called out to was Amari Masahiko, but it was surprisingly effective. After all, he himself didn&rsquo;t have an answer as to whether he was a demon or a human.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that&rsquo;s when he started to worry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even for Masahiko, this development was too unexpected.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problem is the presence of Velgrynd here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t because he thought he could win that he rejected Velgrynd&rsquo;s proposal in the first place. On the contrary, he broke off the negotiations to embolden his comrades because he knew he was going to lose.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be frank, Velgrynd&rsquo;s presence was on another level. This is not a battleground of who can or cannot win, but a dead end when one is against them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, the best thing to do would be to withdraw from this place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The alternative is to accept the offer, but that was rejected.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he gives in to her demands, the entire strategy is broken, and the operation is over. In that case, the blame would fall on himself and Pulcinella, but Masahiko wasn&rsquo;t straighforward enough to think that was a good thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rather, he felt comfortable with the demon&rsquo;s defeat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If anything, his human side was stronger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Masahiko was shaken by Gensei&rsquo;s call.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His human heart was telling him to go back to Gensei&rsquo;s side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demon&rsquo;s intellect cries out, unwilling to admit defeat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Human reason tells him that there is no point in running away now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every demonic instinct was afraid of the threat of Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These various pieces of information conflicted with each other and tormented Masahiko.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">I see&hellip;the demon&rsquo;s greatest weakness is its lack of self-awareness. At least if he&rsquo;d been given a name he would have established a firm sense of self. No. That&rsquo;s exactly why I&rsquo;ve conquered the demon. Yes. I am Amari Masahiko. I am not a demon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amari Masahiko was in agony.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The way he looked was just like a human being.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing that, Gensei and the others decided that it was okay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Remember, Masahiko! To whom did you give your loyalty? Who did you hone your sword skills for? Strength is nothing but violence unless it is properly understood. Have you forgotten that lesson?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amari Masahiko remembers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He remembered that he had pledged his allegiance to the Emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He remembered that his sword should be wielded to protect the weak.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Masahiko-san and Kondou-san also fought valiantly to the end and lost their battle. I admired the two of you so much that it was almost dazzling to me. And yet&hellip;the reason Kondou-san died was because of a demon! Are you going to be one of them!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t the demon&rsquo;s fault, but that&rsquo;s how Velgrynd explained it, so everyone believed it. No one interfered and it wasn&rsquo;t a complete lie, so the story was true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So even Masahiko believed it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s unforgivable&rsquo;&hellip;and his heart burned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Somewhere inside his mind, he heard a cracking sound.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He stopped thinking and listened to his heart&rsquo;s desire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Xianhua&rsquo;s case, the demon side called out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while. It&rsquo;s been a long time since we&rsquo;ve met here. We don&rsquo;t need words between you and me. Let&rsquo;s fight each other.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong smiled wryly and held up his fist.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was hard to believe that he was in his fifties. Now that he was merged with the demon, he seemed to have regained his youthfulness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">More ferociously, he was obsessed with Xianhua.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a persistent man. How many times do I have to beat you to get you to admit defeat?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Unless you kill me, I&rsquo;ll never admit defeat. You were better than me, sure, but that&rsquo;s in the past. I will keep challenging you to a fight until I win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wanted to take over the position of the Dragon Fist&rsquo;s rightful successor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though Li Jinlong had become a demon, he still couldn&rsquo;t give up his ambition.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your persistence is the only thing that&rsquo;s admirable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop laughing. If I win by any means, it is justice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as he finished, Li Jinlong let loose with a thrust.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was half-armed and slid across the floor, closing the distance in one fluid motion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His front right fist is like a missile. The energy generated by his toes rode the momentum of his hip&rsquo;s rotation and converged into a well-honed fist.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the addition of the demon&rsquo;s power, it was so powerful that an ordinary person would be reduced to a crumbling mess.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xianhua would have been done for if he took it properly, but he danced like a leaf to shrug off the power.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s not all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xianhua&rsquo;s hands are wrapped in purple lightning and her left hand is snugly attached to the approaching fist. Grabbing the fist to take advantage of the power of the thrust, she dodges a front leg and takes Li Jinlong&rsquo;s back. She pushes Li Jinlong back, knocks him to the floor, and then strikes with her free right fist, aiming for the back of his head and the root of his neck.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A brilliant move that was stunning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong, in the midst of his divine speed thrusts and in a released fist position, could not help but do as he was forced.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition to the impact that ripped through his body, he was also hit on the vital point. It wasn&rsquo;t safe for Li Jinlong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the demon general Li Jinlong still did a great job.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xianhua&rsquo;s fighting spirit was so strong that an ordinary demon would have been obliterated in an instant, but he was still able to stand up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That hurt. My subordinates would&rsquo;ve died.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still as tough as ever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. You won&rsquo;t enjoy it if it&rsquo;s over after one shot. This is just the beginning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laughing fiercely at Li Jinlong, Xianhua clicked her tongue.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a vulgar guy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong! You know what I mean.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong was more innocent than expected, but Xianhua was unconcerned and resumed the onslaught.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The more moderate pairing would be United States Secret Service Representative Billy, and David Reagan, the Commander of the United States of Azalea Grand South Sea Fleet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lord, you have been charged with treason. I would advise you to prove your innocence in court.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let me tell you, I&rsquo;m not like the rest of humanity. I cannot be judged by the laws of men.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then I will be forcibly restrain you. If you resist, I will be permitted to shoot, and I will not hesitate to do so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me laugh. I&rsquo;m over the limits of humanity now, and I don&rsquo;t think that kind of toy is going to work!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As David laughed, Billy pulled the trigger without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course. Aiming at the enemy is a basic tactic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He fired his bullets with all his fighting spirit. One shot a day, specially made to give it everything he&rsquo;s got.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">They only last a week, so there are seven rounds in stock. S &amp; WM </span><span class="c28">&#12887;, a</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Magnum Revolver, has six rounds of ammunition, each one a deadly weapon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, the gun has been transformed by Velgrynd into a mythical-grade weapon. The power of the bullets had been greatly increased, enough to penetrate David&rsquo;s defensive wards.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Guhaa!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">David was stunned as the first bullet shot through his heart.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had let his guard. Aside from Velgrynd, he had thought the others posed no threat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">This is bad. What&rsquo;s going on?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He can&rsquo;t help but wonder why he&rsquo;s in such a state of shock.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">David thought being a demon freed him from his fear of death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no escaping pain and sickness if you&rsquo;re human. But as a demon, David thought he would have nothing to do with it..</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, Billy&rsquo;s gun was a danger to himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That realization frightened David. The weakness of the human heart had overridden the demon&rsquo;s will.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was an unexpected miscalculation for the demon that possessed David.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because David&rsquo;s mind was so weak, possession was easy. But now that weakness had become his own weakness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking next to him, Li Jinlong also struggled against Xianhua.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">David was confused by this nonsense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have you changed your perspective?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Billy goes on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not a fight that can be won.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He catches the opponent off guard, upsets him, makes him think he has the advantage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He knows that only by gaining an advantage will he be able to win.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has six bullets left.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, one shot needs to be loaded, and he doesn&rsquo;t think his opponent will allow it. If he doesn&rsquo;t finish him off within the remaining five shots, Billy&rsquo;s defeat will be decided right then and there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was precisely because he was thinking this that he hesitated to fire all of his rounds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">At that moment</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both men thought at the same time that if they didn&rsquo;t get the fight going, they would lose.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The stalemate came to an unexpected halt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of the confrontations were unreasonable combinations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demon Delia and the six warriors against her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia was furious.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, why are there six of them coming only to me!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the last thing she wanted to hear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, Delia urged further.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Scatter. Help those who look more in trouble!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But her voice was ignored.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come here to help you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cried Bright, the leader of the Seven Vessels.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then put that sword away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia shouts back, sending the slash away from Bright&rsquo;s slash. And then a bow and arrow fly in for the opportunity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Watch out! You&rsquo;re still so cunning! What do I do if it pierces me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because of her heightened ability to sense danger, Delia was able to evade. She complains to the bowman, but the gringo-looking young bowman is out of the picture.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Delia, I&rsquo;m sorry, but can you please calm down and be caught? I know you&rsquo;re in a bad way right now, and we&rsquo;re all in mortal danger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The whip-handler hunts Delia down languidly but precisely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The archer responds with more attacks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to help, why don&rsquo;t you at least try to talk?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia complained, desperately avoiding those attacks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One against six.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Normally, the aggressor would have the advantage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the truth was, Delia was on the winning side. If Delia had her way, those six warriors would have sunk in a pool of blood.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t because she wasn&rsquo;t willing to.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia&rsquo;s human self was coming back to life as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demon&rsquo;s strategy was perfect but stealing the human name had thrown a wrench in the works. Even without the appearance of Velgrynd, it would have failed somewhere along the line.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To the viewer, it was a clear situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The strategy room in the demon stronghold has been thrown into chaos by the battle with the intruders.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only Velgrynd, who was healing Emile, and Mystery Monk Pulcinella, who was folding his arms, were at ease.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite being called a saint, he is evil in nature. And he was so cunning that no one would ever know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, too, he sees the situation and seeks what is best for him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the very essence of human desire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demon&rsquo;s ego was eaten long ago.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that doesn&rsquo;t mean assimilation was complete. Pulcinella&rsquo;s priority was to absorb power, and the demon&rsquo;s knowledge took a back seat. He thought that as long as he had his power, he could handle the rest.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, he had accumulated a little bit of knowledge, but he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to study it intentionally. &lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo; would take an enormous amount of time to acquire memories that would span millions of years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, absorbing unnecessary knowledge may affect your ego. This was Pulcinella&rsquo;s misfortune.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was unfortunate for Pulcinella, because he lacked knowledge of Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Pulcinella made a fatal mistake here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Instead of dealing with Velgrynd, he let his own desires take precedence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Amari Masahiko is a cunning man. He must know that if we break the Underworld Gate, we can become kings. That&rsquo;s why I was right to pretend not to notice. That&rsquo;s why he trusts me. I&rsquo;ll use these intruders to my advantage!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella will use the opportunity to break the Underworld Gate and kill Masahiko. He planned to become king, but he saw the chaos as an opportunity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demon that possessed Pulcinella had always fought on the front lines as Cornu&rsquo;s &ldquo;chief strategist&rdquo;. Thus, he had earned the Extra Skill of &lsquo;Life Drain.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Unlike Ruminas&rsquo; &lsquo;Energy Drain&rsquo; and Yuki&rsquo;s &lsquo;Still Life</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rsquo;, this Skill allows you to harness the energy of a dead enemy. However, it can only take less than 10% of your magicule at most. And since it can&rsquo;t be used in battle, it isn&rsquo;t that useful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, the advantage was that the more you fought, the stronger you became.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">However</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella&rsquo;s desire had sublimated his authority.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">This was the Unique Skill &lsquo;Mitasumono (Instant Buddha)</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It gives the authority to take away as much power as your body is satisfied from an unconsciously weakened opponent. It&rsquo;s also difficult to use in battle but it can come alive during melee.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And here, in this place, there were some pretty good fighters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Kekeke. If I play my cards right, I could double their strength. Then Masahiko and even others will be no match for me. From now on, it will not be Cornu. From now on he will serve as my second in command.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He could only see his own desires and even called out his lord Cornu.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella kept watching the situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has been observing the situation and has identified a prime target.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battle between Xianhua and Li Jinlong was closer than expected, even though Xianhua had the upper hand. Both sides are exhausted, but the battle is still not over.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">It&rsquo;s a good thing to take from the weak, but that would make me wary of the strong. In that respect, Xianhua is the best!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Originally, Xianhua thought that Pulcinella was his prey. This situation had come about before he went to China, but in the end, he gloated that it was all planned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, he took aim at the moment Xianhua and Li Jinlong collided and bared his fangs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xianhua and Li Jinlong exchange fists, but there is a smile on each other&rsquo;s faces.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, Xianhua. I&rsquo;ve been a no match for you for so long, and now I&rsquo;m fighting you like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong, who had been wearing armor and sleeves until now, was happy to be able to fight Xianhua.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xianhua was his dream.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was so loved so much that she could not just be described as a genius.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong&rsquo;s heart for her was complicated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it wasn&rsquo;t for Xianhua, he would have been the heir apparent. But seeing Xianhua&rsquo;s brilliance when she was just a little girl, he also wanted to see how far the girl could go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, Li Jinlong must have admitted that he had lost.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Humph! There&rsquo;s no point in asking for help from others instead of elevating yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You talk like you know what you&rsquo;re talking about.

The spirit contains the knowledge and experience of each of previous successors. So, it&rsquo;s only natural that one should be stronger than their predecessors. Our founder&rsquo;s dream was to be the strongest in the world. It is precisely because he pursued such an impossible dream that he has created a way to pass it on to the next generation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That reminds Li Jinlong too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rumor has it that the successor will always be stronger than the predecessor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now he understands why.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he realizes that Xianhua&rsquo;s power isn&rsquo;t just hers, it&rsquo;s the power of so many great people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have the power of others&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t lose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Man is a creature that creates a new path based on the accumulated knowledge of his predecessors.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The philosophy of the Dragon Fist is the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without a strong foundation, a building will tilt. They had to raise themselves to embrace the power of others.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying that I haven&rsquo;t trained enough!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. The power you have is useless if you can&rsquo;t master it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tch!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong was humiliated, but he knew it to be true. If you only compared the strength, she was better than him. He was still at a disadvantage and there was no excuse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His high spirits were dampened, but he still enjoyed the situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s not at an advantage, but there is the feeling that victory is within reach. The desperate exchange of life made Li Jinlong&rsquo;s blood boil.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demon&rsquo;s ego urges him to restrain himself, but he has no intention of listening to it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">More! More! Faster and stronger, I&rsquo;m going to win!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His sense of inferiority to Xianhua disappears and the desire to win only grows. Correspondingly, even the demon&rsquo;s ego began to help Li Jinlong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a sign of complete assimilation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Make each other&rsquo;s desires their own and the boundary between their hearts will be dissolved.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong is convinced that he can defeat Xianhua.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was at that time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they collided again, Pulcinella is standing behind Xianhua.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nnngh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella&rsquo;s sword plunged into Xianhua&rsquo;s back in a moment that didn&rsquo;t even take a blink of an eye.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kahahaha!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fresh blood splattered from Xianhua&rsquo;s mouth as she collapsed on the spot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only because Xianhua had trained her body to the utmost limit and stepped into the semi-spiritual life form as a Sage, was she able to avoid instant death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Pulcinella had cut out Xianhua&rsquo;s heart.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this rate, Xianhua&rsquo;s death was only a matter of time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella is elated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had devoured Xianhua&rsquo;s heart and invoked his Unique Skill.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Delicious. This will greatly increase my power!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">True to his words, Pulcinella was filled with energy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His subordinate Li Jinlong was enraged by this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ignoring the absolute hierarchy as a demon, the human part of him screams from his heart.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bastard! You&rsquo;ve not only sabotaged our game, but you&rsquo;ve sabotaged my dreams! If you&rsquo;re the strongest, you&rsquo;ll have to beat me fair and square!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s what he shouted as he threw a kick.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it doesn&rsquo;t work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a desperate right-sided kick, but it was easily stopped by Pulcinella&rsquo;s outstretched left hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Vulnerable! And there is no need for subordinates to oppose. You will be my food, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since he hadn&rsquo;t fully captured Xianhua&rsquo;s power yet, even if he ate it now, it would only be able to provide a small amount of power. Nevertheless, Pulcinella smiled lecherously and destroyed Li Jinlong&rsquo;s leg.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Guaah</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although this demon had no sense of pain, Li Jinlong&rsquo;s human consciousness was so strong that it caused him to feel phantom pain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella laughs at that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop laughing! You are a fool who doesn&rsquo;t even know how to use the power of a demon and what it means to transcend the species of a human!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he had understood his characteristics as a demon, he would have been able to make use of his power more fully. If so, he would have been able to defeat Xianhua!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella laughed and thought about how he should educate his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they were still demons, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, but if they had developed a human identity, it would be tricky. There are advantages and disadvantages.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Being flexible was an advantage, but the possibility of betrayal was a disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demons have an absolute hierarchy, but depending on their desires, some will put their ego ahead of that. This is certain since that is what Pulcinella is doing now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In terms of strengthening his own forces, he should let Li Jinlong be the example and make him understand his own power:&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">It would be troublesome if he betrayed. After all, I should leave things as they are until we build a ruling system that does not allow for betrayal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he has set the policy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He now thinks he&rsquo;s become a king.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, there are few executives left.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong will take matters into his own hands and Emile is protected by Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That leaves Delia, David, and the questionable Amari Masahiko.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Masahiko is a tricky man, but he would swear to be a confidant if he showed him the overwhelming difference in strength.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">He&rsquo;s not stupid. If he realizes he can&rsquo;t win, he&rsquo;ll cooperate. So the question is, who&rsquo;s that Velgrynd? That woman will be sacrificed as a test of my strength.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was very happy to draw a future forecast, but that cannot be a reality.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a moment of happy fantasy, Pulcinella clenched his fist as he was about to strike a blow to Li Jinlong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An evil aura surrounds him, as he attempts to crush Li Jinlong&rsquo;s head&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Get out of the way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The moment he heard the voice, an intense pain that he never imagined ran all over his body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The pain was so great that Pulcinella was rolling around and was not laughing at Li Jinlong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong could not help but laugh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Xianhua, I won&rsquo;t let you die. If you die here, Long&rsquo;s dream will also die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As usual, Velgrynd does not give a damn about the convenience of others.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the best way to deal with a dying being.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xianhua, who had been waiting to die, felt like she wanted to talk back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Regeneration. Also healing for recovery of physical strength. How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd healed Xianhua with a powerful spell of regeneration of the heart and then regained her strength on top of that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd had learned holy magic from her travels in various worlds. She did not need it at all, but did it mainly for the benefit of Rudra&rsquo;s reincarnations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the meantime, people really worshiped in her, but they didn&rsquo;t know much about her. It was an act of God in this world, but, well, it didn&rsquo;t matter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uhh&hellip;I&rsquo;m healed. I&rsquo;m not in any pain at all, and I feel fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are people like Hinata who have a high resistance to magic. But &lsquo;God&#39;s Miracle,&rsquo; interfering with the spirit particle had no problem making it work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. God&rsquo;s Miracle.&rsquo; I thought &lsquo;Resurrection&rsquo; was an overreaction. That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s right, there was even more magic than that&mdash;muttered Xianhua in her mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, she was back in shape, but that didn&rsquo;t solve the problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What Pulcinella had taken was Xianhua&rsquo;s spirit. The knowledge and experience that had been entrusted to her for generations was still there, but most of her power is gone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unless something is done about this, Xianhua will remain weakened.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">This would normally be a big problem</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">but Velgrynd was here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let me help you. It&rsquo;s dragon&rsquo;s energy, so it&rsquo;s a good substitute.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Far from benig a substitute, it wil be stronger than ever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that was only on a human scale.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From Velgrynd&rsquo;s point of view, it was only a margin of error, so she didn&rsquo;t hesitate to send the dragon energy into Xianhua.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The power stabilizing dragon qi strengthened Xianhua&rsquo;s body. Although not quite a Saint, Xianhua had fully awakened as a Sage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So this is&hellip;the power of Ryuo-sama, which was only given to the Founder!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong, who had been stunned and left behind in the situation, nodded his head in satisfaction for some reason. His expression was just like he had been when he was a human.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kekeke, after all, that kid should be like this. It&rsquo;s only when you&rsquo;re at a high level that you can be movtivated this way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was again one-sidedly looking at Xianhua as a rival, muttering something like. Even in the eyes of Demon General Li Jinlong, she was getting stronger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And although a jubilant Xianhua didn&rsquo;t realize it, her life has been greatly extended now that she had become Sage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She would rise to heights that even Long could not reach and would live as the ruler of this world as a &ldquo;Dragon Fist Master.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s another story.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Blown away by Velgrynd, Pulcinella could not understand what had happened to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he was inferior to Cornu, he should have had absolute power. And yet, he was left with unbearable pain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">What? Why am I feeling such pain like a human being?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason is simple&hellip; The crimson cardinal aura of Velgrynd will burn anyone it touches.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this time, she didn&rsquo;t intend to kill him, so she was holding back as best she could&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Had he realized that, Pulcinella would not have repeated his folly any further. But he was more intoxicated with himself as a king than he had ever imagined. That&rsquo;s why he was so blind to reality and went into things he shouldn&rsquo;t have.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Surprising or petty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the speech of a wretched little man who can&rsquo;t even understand the gap between them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Velgrynd had no idea it was directed at her. So she didn&rsquo;t care and moved on to the next person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She stood behind David, who was staring at Billy, and smacked him on the head with her palm. The cardinal aura destroyed the demon in one blow. It was an impressive feat of strength, but it was just like Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Pulcinella also moved in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t like what he saw and sent orders to Delia.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Give me that spear!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You cannot bring out the spear&rsquo;s true value. That spear will be more valuable to me than its disappointing owner.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella stole Delia&rsquo;s spear. He senses its power and smiles, thinking he can win.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, as Delia is pushed away, her former comrades rush in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bright calls out on behalf of the others.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing that, tears start to fall down Delia&rsquo;s cheeks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re stupid. I&rsquo;m not human. I&rsquo;m a demon that has invaded this world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re crying. Those tears are the proof that you&rsquo;re still human.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bright&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In general, your memory is intact, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get rid of the demon, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so brazen, you can&rsquo;t lose to a demon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, Delia was sure she heard the sound of something crunching somewhere in her mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey Catalina, if you&rsquo;re going to comfort me, you should comfort me properly! What do you mean I&rsquo;m brazen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I meant. I had faith that you&rsquo;d come back to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Catalina hugs Delia, crying.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the others too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No more words are needed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Delia laughed from the bottom of her heart as her friends shouted in joy one by one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing Delia and her friends, Pulcinella snorted unpleasantly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good grief. That&rsquo;s why humans&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even David has come to his senses at the hands of Velgrynd. Delia was his only loyal subordinate, but it seems that herr human ego has won out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, then he can&rsquo;t expect to get Masahiko as well. It seemed that his human ego had begun to win, and he should have thought that a joint struggle was impossible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he sees no problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because Pulcinella now has the most powerful weapon in the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">This performance is mythical-grade! It still refuses to believe that I&rsquo;m the master, but it&rsquo;s strong enough. It can handle that damned Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he was doing the math.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was a helplessly unrefined man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But somewhere inside, alarm bells were ringing. He had found information about Velgrynd from the missing demon&rsquo;s knowledge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he had scrutinized it carefully, he would have been able to find out more&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only one I can rely on, right? Very well. I will take care of you myself!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;s talking to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really a stupid woman! There&rsquo;s no other</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c6">Buberaaa</span><span class="c9">&mdash;!</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He announced his intention to kill her openly, but it was a bad move.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Until now, he had been overlooked because she was not interested in him, but now he was recognized as an enemy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, Velgrynd thought there was a chance that Pulcinella could turn back from a demon to a human, and was taking it easy on Pulcinella to keep him from dying.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What&rsquo;s really annoying is that since Pulcinella had only taken over the demon&rsquo;s consciousness, his &ldquo;heart&rdquo; was still intact.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With this blow, it was shattered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, our mission is over. This man has conquered the demon on his own, so there are no more demons to be taken over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd declared radiantly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The six phantom leaders were present.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">David and Emile had been stripped of their demon powers by Velgrynd and are now normal human beings again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Li Jinlong and Delia, as well as Amari Masahiko, have reclaimed themselves. The demon&rsquo;s power remains, but that didn&rsquo;t bother Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Pulcinella had shattered the demon&rsquo;s core, but something was wrong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kekeke! Thank you very much! The damned seal that warned me of my power has been broken!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demon&rsquo;s power had been fully absorbed and even its form had begun to mutate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His skin had turned pale and his eyes were red. He was different from the lower-ranked ones&hellip; he even had wings like an angel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The robe he wears is a modified version of the armor the demon used to wear. Of course, because it had been in existence for so long, it boasted a considerably high performance in the legendary class.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The spear in his hand, which he had taken from Delia, had also been transformed into a scepter. In other words, it had now accepted Pulcinella as its owner.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella&rsquo;s own magicules are insufficient to fully free him. But still, Pulcinella feels as if his energy has doubled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella is in a frenzy of euphoria, and he is at his peak.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was foolishly growing to think that no one could rival him now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that, Velgrynd snorted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Could it be that he&rsquo;s a real idiot?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she lets Pulcinella do as he pleases.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s the absolute strongest in the world and she&rsquo;s not going to panic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknowingly, Pulcinella, in his full form, is smiling broadly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is a wonderfully comforting feeling. This is a power so great it could beat Cornu-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella&rsquo;s omnipotence was so great that he could even say so boastfully.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, his power had risen to the level of an Awakened Demon Lord, and Pulcinella felt that he had surpassed his limits.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this was only the idea of someone with a small measure of knowledge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. There&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;re going to win the game when there&rsquo;s a difference of more than ten times.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was such a ridiculous misunderstanding that Velgrynd couldn&rsquo;t help but poke fun at it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet Pulcinella is furious when it is pointed out to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh dear, what a pity it is to be a fool who does not know reason!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone but himself thought that it was him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd finally realized that Pulcinella seemed to be undermining her. But she didn&rsquo;t know why. He seems to think he can beat Velgrynd, but she has no idea what he&rsquo;s basing this on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s known demons for a long time, so she didn&rsquo;t expect someone who didn&rsquo;t know her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if he&rsquo;s are a minor phantom, it&rsquo;s no surprise that he doesn&rsquo;t know her. But a former angel of the Three Marshals would have trembled just at the mention of Velgrynd&rsquo;s name.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a natural reaction when faced with the powerful True Dragon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet, Pulcinella&rsquo;s reaction was very unnatural.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was why Velgrynd was confused, wondering if he might be mistaken.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been bothering me for a while now, but you&rsquo;re pretty rude. You didn&rsquo;t mean me when you said the word &lsquo;fool&rsquo; now, did you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a long journey, Velgrynd has become surprisingly patient.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In her own estimation, she&rsquo;s full of charity, if not a bit more compassionate, than she was before.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why she asked that instead of getting angry, but Pulcinella didn&rsquo;t get the picture.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Apparently, you&rsquo;re a little strong, but most of the time I&rsquo;m confident. There is a whole world out there with more to come&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&lsquo;Oh, he really doesn&rsquo;t know&rsquo;</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">Velgrynd realized.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had overcome the phantom ego and was acting by Pulcinella&rsquo;s will.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And at the same time, she pitied Pulcinella, who was possessed by a demon and prioritized knowledge, as opposed to Masahiko, who was possessed by a demon and only wanted power.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">That&rsquo;s why this guy has grown to this point without knowing the important things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was so convinced that she was more amazed than angry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd ignored Pulcinella, who was making some kind of speech, and asked Gensei and the others.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is the right thing to do with this man? I shattered the demon&rsquo;s core, but its power is still intact. Even I can&rsquo;t help him in this situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That means you can&rsquo;t take the power away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Pulcinella misunderstood.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kekeke, of course! It&rsquo;s too late to be afraid now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He mistakenly understood that Velgrynd had declared to be no match for him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was a man of infinitely happy thought processes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;For the spirit of a being who so frankly admits defeat, you may now join as my subordinate. I thank you for your mercy and invite you to join me at the head of the household&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another slap from Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unable to react to this, Pulcinella now realizes that this is crazy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Could I be mistaken?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thinking so, he tries to decipher the memories he&rsquo;s been searching for.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he couldn&rsquo;t do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the demon&rsquo;s heart was shattered by Velgrynd, all memory information was lost.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">This is not good!!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without knowing why, Pulcinella became agitated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leaving Pulcinella alone, Velgrynd resumes her conversation with Gensei.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be too much trouble for you guys to keep this man alive. I think it&rsquo;s better to kill him, what do you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd doesn&rsquo;t care if Pulcinella lives or dies.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she can&rsquo;t leave him unattended.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as Akira Sakura is alive, everything&rsquo;s all right with Velgrynd. But after that, she doesn&rsquo;t know what will happen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd has no intention of taking responsibility and will always travel to find the next piece of soul. In that case, there will be no one left to stop Pulcinella.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, she knows that Rudra&rsquo;s reincarnation had happened many times in this world, and his bloodline had been passed down. It was no fun for Velgrynd to let Pulcinella do as she pleased.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was obvious that Gensei&rsquo;s people couldn&rsquo;t handle it, and that was why it would be quicker to take care of it here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s certainly true, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one from Roziam was here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When only your own heroes are killed, there will always be some lingering effects. Even if you realize that it was a fair decision, it won&rsquo;t be fun.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd is worried about that and asks what to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, it&rsquo;s not the kindness of Velgrynd that keeps Pulcinella alive. She simply concludes that she might cause trouble for Akira if she kills him on her own.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why she left the decision to someone else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since everyone is from another country, they will be hard to judge. After consulting with all of them, she decided that if they chose to let Pulcinella go here, that was fine.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aside from Masahiko, the others could also read Velgrynd&rsquo;s intentions. So they felt free to speak their minds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other choice but to get rid of him. Tell them he was possessed by a demon and that I did it. If Roziam demands my custody, you can give it to me without a care in the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Masahiko said this, Gensei had a hard time with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I agree to take care of it, but you won&rsquo;t be a victim. I&rsquo;ll explain the situation and ask you to understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s Azalea&rsquo;s people who are on board with this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. If you didn&rsquo;t understand what was going on, then you can put pressure on them. We at Azalea will help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have a problem with that statement, Commander. But I agree with the idea of getting rid of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Too much power brings bad luck. That&rsquo;s what my grandfather used to say. I think Pulcinella-san&rsquo;s unhappiness is partly to blame.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Billy and Emile also expressed their approval, remonstrating David&rsquo;s remarks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incidentally, Laurent Hayes, Emile&rsquo;s grandfather, would only turn to Velgrynd for really trivial matters. Remembering this, Velgrynd smiled as an afterthought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Chinese are silent in a tolerant stance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They don&#39;t have good feelings because of Roziam attacking the land. That is why they refrain from speaking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The last were those of Arcia, but they were ready to kill.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter why. Let&rsquo;s kill him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He pushed Delia away and even took away her weapon. I&rsquo;d kill him with my own hands if I could.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s right. I see no reason to disagree.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Same to the right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, well, they were angry that their friends had been hurt, and the comments continued with no weight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella heard this and knew that his situation was very dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">This woman, Velgrynd, is going to kill me. But before that happens</span><span class="c9 c16">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He thought to come up with a plan to come back to life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Secretly, he put all my heart and soul into this plan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And with his back to Velgrynd, he aimed for a sneak attack.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had abandoned his pride as a saint.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chivalry is useless when you&rsquo;re between life and death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You will die! Take this&hellip;my soulful blow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a mystical art in the holy spirit world where evil spirits are destroyed with the help of the gods and Buddha. Add to this the power of demons and you have an immense rush of energy that has never before been observed in this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The aftermath alone was devastating.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The earth trembled and the sky shook.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The base that had been rebuilt as a demon stronghold couldn&rsquo;t withstand the impact and began to collapse. Not only had it survived a bombing, but it was stronger than a nuclear shelter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The distance that lies between Pulcinella and Velgrynd will be filled in less than a second. That much damage was done in that instant. It was clear how tremendous the attack was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">I won! No life form could withstand this power. Now I will be the ruler of this world!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella witnessed this moment, trying to prove his victory.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd&rsquo;s defenseless back was pierced by this energy in the shape of a spear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet&mdash;Velgrynd was unharmed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It didn&rsquo;t work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It couldn&rsquo;t work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It couldn&rsquo;t work because the other party Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The energy that could even wipe out this entire continent in an instant was instantly dissipated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to the bottom of this in a moment, so sit tight and wait.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as she said this as if it was nothing, Pulcinella could not help but realize that he would never win.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would never be able to beat Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe things would have turned out differently if he&rsquo;d given up then.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it makes no sense to assume that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella had done something he shouldn&rsquo;t have done, at the wrong time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What a relief!

Well, I can understand why you&rsquo;d be nervous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By rushing the conversation, Pulcinella irritated Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Understanding that it was the right thing to do, Velgrynd continued to go along.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella is the kind of coward who aims for a sudden attack while they are discussing whether or not to make use of him. It would have been better to kill him quickly, but Velgrynd decided to listen to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">The reason is simpl</span><span class="c9">e&mdash;</span><span class="c0">to avoid trouble later.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he&rsquo;s going to tell me about the deviousness, she thinks it&rsquo;s only polite to listen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, one of the reasons was that she had absolute confidence that she&rsquo;d be fine no matter what he did to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So far, Velgrynd had been listening to Pulcinella&rsquo;s story in a relatively relaxed manner, but her smile fades when she hears his next comment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is my plan, exactly? I&rsquo;m going to steal those bombs and detonate them over each country&rsquo;s capitals. I&rsquo;ve already got a hand in place. It&rsquo;s too late to panic!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The damned thing had already been exposed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What nonsense! If you do this, innocent people will be killed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous, bastard! Without leadership, the order in the country will collapse as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I thought the basic plan of the demon&rsquo;s plan was to raise humanity as your dependents, what the hell do you think you&rsquo;re doing!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking around at the people who were shouting, Pulcinella gave a twisted smile of amusement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How delightful. Yes, of course. I&rsquo;m also at a loss. As Masahiko says, it&rsquo;s best to cultivate humans. But the sheer number of them outweighs the demons. They&rsquo;ll live through this war-torn age, so it doesn&rsquo;t affect us. All we have to do is slowly gather the survivors and breed them!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella boasted that there was no problem, although the plan was delayed. The theory was ridiculous, but it wasn&#39;t wrong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Realizing this, even Amari Masahiko stopped talking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gensei also paled and looked at Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Pulcinella was going on explaining for so long, it means he was stalling. That means the plan is currently in progress.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no way for Gensei and his team to get out of this situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;d have to rely on &lsquo;Instantaneous Movement&rsquo;, which only Velgrynd can perform.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There would be many casualties, but they must still let the world leaders alone. Fortunately, now that they had all taken refuge in the Empire, Gensei thought that Velgrynd would be able to get them out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why he watched Velgrynd but regretted not seeing it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because right there was an angry goddess.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella&rsquo;s plan was an offense to Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It pains me that innocent lives must be sacrificed. If it were possible, I would prefer not to inflict that kind of sacrifice. How about it? Shall you leave me alone? If we don&rsquo;t interfere with each other, I&rsquo;ll give you the empire&mdash;no, half the world, if that&rsquo;s what you want!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulcinella didn&rsquo;t take a chance and offered Velgrynd a deal. He thought he had a good chance with the bomb threat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he had been too naive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lowlife. I would have let you get away with any underhanded move against me, but I won&rsquo;t let you get away with anything that involves that person. I won&rsquo;t let you go back to the Wheel of Reincarnation. I&rsquo;ll break your soul and give you eternal suffering.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Velgrynd&rsquo;s true nature is caustic</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s powerful, so she can afford to be, but at the flip of a switch, she&rsquo;ll snap at the drop of a hat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, wait! That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t want to be a part of this&mdash;wait! If I don&rsquo;t tell them to stop, my men will detonate the bombs! They&rsquo;re already over the capitals of five countries. Let&rsquo;s not be so rude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up. I took care of that a long time ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What was said was incomprehensible to Pulcinella.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t just Pulcinella, but none of the people there could understand what Velgrynd had said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They didn&rsquo;t think she was bluffing, either, but it felt like she was telling the truth. But it would be impossible for her to be here and protect five countries at once.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was a narrow-minded assessment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd has &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; so that can be dealt with without difficulty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd would never leave Akira&rsquo;s side, so the kingdom was secure.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if she&rsquo;d been somewhere before, she can get there in a flash. Azalea, Arcia, Roziam and China. All of these places had been visited by Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All problems were cleared.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; was separated from Velgrynd beside Akira and scattered to the nations. They then sought out the hidden demons and blew away the new bombs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible! How is that possible!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He tried desperately to contact his men, but they were long dead and he never heard from them. Pulcinella&rsquo;s face contorted in horror as he faced that reality.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He finally realized just how dangerous this beautiful woman in front of him was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Forgive me, please forgive me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1128.82px;"><img alt="ARA ARA ARA" src="images/image19.jpg" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1128.82px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s nothing scarier than an angry, beautiful woman&rsquo;s smile.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone in the room understood that this was the case.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;No, no</span><span class="c9">&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A flash of supernova-like light flares up behind Pulcinella as he tries to escape.

In the aftermath, the seas were rough and tempest-like, and various phenomena occurred, but Velgrynd calmed them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Evaporated seawater created a storm, but her weather control saved the day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The lost cove had turned into magma, but that too had been taken care of.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were lost plantations and such, but through an unintelligible act of divine grace, a new environment was born that day, thanks to a high healing of the earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, as a result&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although the terrain had changed, the impact was minimal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the crisis of humanity&rsquo;s invasion by demons was safely solved with the help of a capricious goddess.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few years later&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd never again interfered in human history.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was because Akira Sakura didn&rsquo;t want it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her power was transcendant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this world without magic, everything would be a farce if Velgrynd traveled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, she entrusted it to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She told him that there would be failures, but that it was for the good of humanity to experience them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spending a peaceful time beside Akira, the goddess watched over the lives of men.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eventually the end would come.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Akira Sakura&rsquo;s life was coming to an end.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd and everyone who cares about him, not to mention Akira&rsquo;s family and close confidants, are all gathered there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, while he was asleep, Akira woke up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am happy.

Not only for your honor, but for the honor of those you love.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or, conversely, you could erase their fear by inciting it, but that is an unacceptable act for a nation or a religion to preside over.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It sounds good when you say it&rsquo;s for someone else&rsquo;s sake, but that is also an act of placing the blame on others. One must take responsibility for their own actions, that&rsquo;s what Akira Sakura tried to convey.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the mercy of the turbulent times, Akira Sakura had a desire to aim for a world without conflict.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t know how to make it come true, but he kept thinking about the answer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Always being responsible for your own actions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Always striving to understand the other and seeking mutual understanding through dialogue.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With these two things, Akira Sakura passed away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His face was filled with peace, and there was no doubt that he had passed away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You did your best.

Then his body began to glow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The light became a small crystal and was absorbed into the shining piece of soul and disappeared. Holding it to her heart, Velgrynd cried lovingly and sadly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that Rudra&rsquo;s reincarnation, Akira Sakura, was gone, there was no reason for Velgrynd to remain there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then, I&rsquo;ll be going, but you guys take care of yourselves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure we won&rsquo;t see each other again, but&hellip;&rsquo; Velgrynd swallowed her words and greeted them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that feelings can be conveyed without saying anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ryuo-sama, I would like to follow you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Maybe.

He seems to have lived a life that never saw the light of day with several mafia groups in tow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, the two remained close, and when something went wrong, Emile turned to Amari Masahiko for help. This is how Emile&rsquo;s entertainment agency would grow into a major corporation that would be known not only in the United States of Azalea, but all over the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On a different note, there is an interesting rumor about this entertainment agency.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">In Emile&rsquo;s office, a beautiful girl named Long Hua</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;is the main attraction. She had retired and then resumed her career after a few years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naturally, she was replaced by her substitutes, but it is well known that her true face remainedd shrouded in mystery.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, according to the rumors, her real name is Xianhua. Strangely enough, all of Long Hua&rsquo;s real names are the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was a dream come true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not true that all of them are the same person, but it makes them think so, and it&#39;s all about the fans.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such topics are often mentioned in weekly magazines, but it goes without saying that they are really the same person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xianhua had gained an immortal body by taking in Velgrynd&rsquo;s dragon energy (aura). She relied on Amari Masahiko because it would be difficult to live in a human society as it was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xianhua was not the only one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Others, such as Li Jinlong and Delia, had defeated the demons on their own and took on the power of a Sage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were others who had also done that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most of the soldiers possessed by the demons had been freed by Velgrynd. However, some of them were awakened as a Sage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such people also gathered under the leadership of Amari Masahiko.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was then that Araki Gensei and Minamoto Saburo-san taught these men the Oboro Shinmei Ryu, the sword that wards off evil. This is how the next generation of strong men would grow up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A supranational anti-demon organization would be born from these men.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their battle would not end until the promised day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c18 c8"></span></p><h1 class="c11" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c15">Chapter 3<br>The Turbulent Days</span></h1><p class="c11 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My name is Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was the captain of the Armored Corps, the most powerful force in the Eastern Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was just plain stupid at the time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said I was doing this for Rudra, but all I had cared about was my own personal glory.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I understand what a career is worth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">That&rsquo;s right&hellip;forty years ago, a commander in chief of a corps from a lowly nobleman&rsquo;s family</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">that&rsquo;s a big promotion. The baron of a married family was a trivial thing from the corps commander&#39;s point of view, but I think it&rsquo;s understandable that I&rsquo;ve grown up, although it is still no excuse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, I&rsquo;m still reflecting on it now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was kicked out of my married house.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was born a knight and was chosen to be the son-in-law of a baron&rsquo;s daughter, who was of the main family at the time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, I was happy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was happy, until she left me after she cheated on me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My wife&mdash;well, my ex-wife, was an irreplaceable existence to me at the time. I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world, and I thought I was the luckiest man in the empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought she felt the same way, and that&rsquo;s why she chose me, but I was wrong. It was my own selfishness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A year later, when my father-in-law died, she left me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I still remember that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sometimes I have nightmares, but I&rsquo;ll never forget the look on her face and the lines she said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you have a good dream? You were a poor knight, and now you were able to imitate a nobleman. But that&rsquo;s over. I was forced to marry you at your father&rsquo;s behest, and now I&rsquo;m free too. But it&rsquo;s your fault. Because you won&rsquo;t have offspring.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was so desperate I wanted to scream.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t know what she was talking about when she told me, but then I saw the bottle she was holding, like she was trying to show me, and it hit me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She must have drugged me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could have complained and taken her to court. But the Baron family was an enemy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s bad enough that my ex-wife had a merchant lover who had money. The Baron&rsquo;s servants had already been bought off.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The merchant was an aristocrat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ex-wife was able to live in the lap of luxury.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My father-in-law always told me to be frugal and proud of my aristocratic ways&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I guess she didn&rsquo;t like that either.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, it&rsquo;s a little late for that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that time, I had no idea that I would ever complain to the main family who took care of me as a close relative. Besides, my parents had died in an accident when I was a kid, so there was no one to argue with.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, well, I had no choice but to leave the baronial family and be driven out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking back, that was the impetus.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Betrayed by someone I loved, and the anger and hatred that drove me on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was going to move up and show them all off someday.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was young, just in my 20s. I used the resentment as energy, and I worked my ass off.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went through deadlines and took great pride in my work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wasn&rsquo;t afraid to get dirty, and I got really good at subterfuge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got to know some merchants and helped them as much as I could with my authority. I accepted back taxes and turned them over to the nobility to make connections.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I worked my way up to the rank of colonel by my mid-20s.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had graduated from knight&rsquo;s school, so I started out as an adjutant. In other words, I was on track to be promoted within a year or two.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was pretty fast, but it worked because power was everything in the Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By then, I had taken control of the military and started forming my own faction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s when I met Minits.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits was an aristocrat, but he was a freak who loved to fight. He was better than me back home and yet he dared to go to war.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there was no doubt he was capable, so I took advantage of him. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting him to like me or respect me, so I had him ask for money without batting an eye.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits was a funny guy, so he took it upon himself to obey orders. Well, he was a guy who probably also took advantage of me, so it was mutual.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was only a consensus of interests, but it was also clear that I trusted him. As long as I was fighting for my career, I&rsquo;d always be looking for the battlefield. I knew that if Minits used me like that, I would follow any order.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because wherever I die, I would die with no family, so I was able to do it without fear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so Minits and I formed a strange bond of trust.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then Kansas joined in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man who was known to be a problem for the military, but for me, it was only a matter of time before he was available for use.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He passed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And apparently it was the same for Kansas.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kansas liked me because I was willing to go along with any plan. Although he was a devastating force at the time, he had a low reputation in the military.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He often violated orders and ran amok on the battlefield. I think he was transferred to me because he was too difficult to deal with, but he was good to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only did I know how to use Minits, I knew how to use Kansas as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was able to plan and execute strategies that ordinary people would have hesitated to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And by doing so, I gained a position where no one could complain about me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I worked my way up to general by my early 30s.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By then, I was out on the front lines less and less.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The poisoning I&rsquo;d gotten as a young man had blinded me in my left eye.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That didn&rsquo;t diminish my powers, though. With the newfound power of science at that time, it was easy to make an elaborate prosthetic eye.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, to throw the opponents off guard, I covered my left eye with an eye patch.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought my powers would fade with age, but I became more and more energetic. I looked like I was suitable for my age, but inside I was bubbling with energy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was always in my prime and that&rsquo;s why I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was interested in fighting the pecking order, but I preferred to control the military.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The generals&rsquo; position was within reach. I thought that would give me more power than becoming an Imperial Knight of His Majesty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was adding to my own faction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I used Master Gadra to help bolster the Armored Corps&rsquo; war effort. I got my merchants to provide money for modernization efforts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was steadily making preparations and building up my resume, and at the age of just over thirty I was appointed as one of the three great generals of the Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The springtime of my life was just around the corner.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So perhaps that&rsquo;s why I was reminded of it during breaks in my work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wondered what the people who kicked me out were doing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I had people look into it, I found that I was behind on the ropes for nothing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t have to wonder why&hellip; but I had an answer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the time, I had the power to destroy them. And it was too much.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was well known that they had kicked me out, so my men did what they had to do even though I didn&rsquo;t do anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They didn&rsquo;t do anything directly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They just quietly talked to their clients about the situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wondered if they were still associating with the people who did that to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That being said, the purveyors would have had no choice but to discover. I was blasting my way up the ladder at a breakneck pace.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To begin with, unlike the west, the empire&rsquo;s economic system did not allow for a free economy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Officially, only the nobility and the military were allowed to do business.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The nobles have the right to have their merchants do business on their behalf. These hired traders were hired to do business for them and get paid from the profits.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why the man who took my wife away from me wanted a position of nobility.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He worked for a high lord and allowed his sons and daughters to join him. This way he could legitimately acquire the rights to do business the old-fashioned way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, it&rsquo;s a good thing I became a baron, but I guess I made a miscalculation in my rise to power.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man who was laughed at and dismissed, was indeed, a general.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s a huge budget allocated to the military, so they can buy and sell goods. And the generals have the right to let the merchants operate it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Generals are in charge of one of the three major legions, as one should know. But this power was even greater than that of the earl.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no reason to compete with a barony, and business was slowing down as clients were turning their backs on him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I remember feeling hollow when I heard that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wanted to avenge him myself, but without my knowledge, it was already being accomplished.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I knew that was not the way to go about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;d been betrayed once. Showing a sweet response here will draw in more people to come after me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the reasons I had risen to the rank of general is that I had no offspring.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you advance in the army, you get a noble title when you leave. The position rises according to the rank.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I don&rsquo;t have children, and I never will.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how high they give, it&rsquo;s only for one generation. It&rsquo;s no threat to other noblemen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aristocrats hate it when military men have wealth, just as the military hates it when noblemen have private armies.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gold for the aristocrats, armed forces for the military.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This division of labor is what matters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was taboo for them to interfere in each other&rsquo;s domain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why many of the senior military personnel are unmarried.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was also the reason that those who do not have a family can stand on the battlefield, but the struggle for power with the nobility was more important.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thinking about that, it occurred to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who betrayed me were destitute but not destroyed, weren&rsquo;t they?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then I had an epiphany.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I still had some work to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They could live on because they were noblemen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although they are low-ranking nobles, they have the status of a baron, and can live off of a salary.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, I must seize that position and destroy it once and for all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there are others who must be purged as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That man&rsquo;s father and the count who had his father working for him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it weren&rsquo;t for these men, I wouldn&rsquo;t be in this misery.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have to destroy my enemies, or I&rsquo;ll get hurt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if I was to destroy the count, I would have needed to grow stronger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From that moment on&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wanted to aim higher&hellip;to gain the power to surpass any person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And then I was just so selfless from then on. It was like I didn&rsquo;t understand but couldn&rsquo;t see how low and dirty the means of what I was doing was.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, yeah. You weren&rsquo;t exactly pleasant to watch back then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then you should have abandoned me. If you had, you would have been the generals.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my thing. And I didn&rsquo;t hate you. Like Kansas, I just wanted to hang out with guys I liked, good guys or bad, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm! You&rsquo;re a strange guy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware of that, but I don&rsquo;t want to be told that by you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that said, the men were laughing at each other.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">A scrawny soldier in his forties and a man in a nice suit</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">Calgurio and Minits.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are talking in the labyrinth at the &ldquo;elf&rsquo;s shop&rdquo; which is reserved for special members only. They are having a private meeting there while enjoying a variety of drinks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The shop was originally only open to a select clientele. They could only enter it on their own or after a background check and payment of the required fee.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t open to two people, but since the summit meeting, it had been open to the Imperial leadership.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Rimuru&rsquo;s intention to put the war behind them and build a better relationship for the future.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, they both understood that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why they were taking advantage of him like this without reservation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, then, as you know, I took control of the army and planned to take over the world. And then we were defeated by this country, and here we are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Defeated&rsquo; is a mild way of putting it. &lsquo;Not even being a match&rsquo; is a more accurate description.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh, no doubt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy, too. Because I&rsquo;ve seen firsthand that there are other unimaginably powerful people in this world besides His Majesty Rudra and Marshal</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">Velgrynd-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand the hobby, but I suppose it would have been nice if you were satisfied. So, are you going to make peace with your younger brother?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio asked, and Minits smiled grimly and nodded.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to. He&rsquo;s the marquis that unites the nobility. As long as Masayuki-sama is crowned as the new emperor, it&rsquo;s our job to support him to the best of our ability.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits was from a marquis family.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He joined the army because he wanted to compete on his own resourcefulness alone, and he has risen to his current position. But there is no doubt that at the level of the Marquis family, their influence was tremendous and they were heavily favored.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, Minits was capable, and no one ever made fun of him. Anyone who did would have seen the foolishness with their own eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits&rsquo; family is the current Marquis, succeeded by his younger brother. His brother has a lot of resentment towards him for the trouble he&rsquo;s caused.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio was relieved to hear that the two sides would reconcile.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Well, in my case, reconciliation is out of the question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio thinks that it is better than his own situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits is fortunate in that he is able to use the family&rsquo;s financial resources as he pleases. He&rsquo;s been overlooked because he&rsquo;s good enough to deserve it, but if he&rsquo;s incompetent then the prodigal brother is also a good place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Calgurio and others don&rsquo;t like that all that much&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They heard that he was complaining about his brother being a cheat&mdash;but all they could come up with was that anyone would think so.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is probably a man like Minits who is allowed to do that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Calgurio also nails this irresponsible man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right. It will be a pleasure to work with you, new Prime Minister.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although Minutes escaped from his duties as an aristocrat, he was appointed to the position of the Prime Minister, who has the highest authority in the empire. It was under the new system with Masayuki as the emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We were in a meeting before, and I said that for the sake of air&hellip; but after thinking it over, it&rsquo;s impossible for me to be an Emperor! I&rsquo;ve never studied politics or anything like that&mdash;no, I learned about it in a high school class, but I only did a little research on the scope of the test for that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, you can&rsquo;t take it back now, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;After all!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course! I&rsquo;m getting by myself, so you can do it too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too optimistic, Rimuru-san! I&rsquo;m not joking, don&rsquo;t be so irresponsible!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, it&rsquo;s okay. Everyone will help you too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Those eyes say that it&rsquo;s definitely someone else&#39;s affair, right? I mean, you&rsquo;re looking happy to have more friends!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. Besides, you have a partner that you can rely on. Like that Minits-san over there. I think he&rsquo;s pretty reliable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the conversation between Masayuki and Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits was also there and his eyes met with Rimuru&rsquo;s, which was a mistake.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a probably whim of Rimuru&rsquo;s, but it was not good to stand out in the meeting. It seems that Rimuru was perceived as a capable man, and he was appointed as a consultant to Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the result was the prime minister position.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits can&rsquo;t help but laugh at that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a consultation that he couldn&#39;t say that he didn&#39;t like as Masayuki had asked him to assist properly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was partly because of the fear of Velgrynd&rsquo;s gaze, and partly because Minits had grown to like Masayuki, after all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problem here is the current Prime Minister, and Minits thinks that he will be his assistant. Since only the Emperor has the right to appoint the Prime Minister, it would be unreasonable for the current Prime Minister to complain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He might complain, but that was of no concern to Minits. It was enough to say that he knew of a scarier being, so he just needed to convince him first.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">So, well, there&rsquo;s something to be said for that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had more than enough education as a nobleman and heir to the marquis family. Although he wasn&rsquo;t aware of it, his grades were not bad either.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He might struggle a bit, but it was Minits&rsquo; self-assessment that he was good enough to be able to practice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Minits turns around and asks Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me laugh, Minister of Military Affairs. You&rsquo;re the only one left of the three major corps leaders, so your responsibility is heavy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under Emperor Masayuki&rsquo;s new regime, the military was going to be significantly reformed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Minutes becomes the Prime Minister, the current one will be the Deputy Prime Minister.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Side by side with him would be the minister of the military.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The military should be led by a politician, according to Masayuki&rsquo;s superficial knowledge. He put it into words and reflected it in the new system.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Masayuki only asked, &ldquo;Does the minister control the army?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He did not mean to suggest that they should do so, and he did not advocate civilian control to more accurately select ministers from the civilian population to control the military.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, it was perceived as a misguided system in which ministers of the military were chosen from amongst the military personnel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, Calgurio was to serve as both a military general and minister of the military.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio laughs and replies to Minits&rsquo; question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry about that. We won&rsquo;t be going to war for a while, and to begin with, as long as I&rsquo;m at the head of the army, I won&rsquo;t be carrying a sword pointed at a foreign country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was an honest feeling, mixed with some resignation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, given the geography of the empire, from now on, there would be no neighboring countries where war could be waged.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Jura-Tempest Federation and the realm controlled by Demon Lord Milim were out of the question, but the Armed Nation of Dwargon was also impossible. If they are to have their support, they must build a friendly relationship with them from now on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An invasion of the Western Nations by airship would be possible, but it was unlikely that Demon Lord Rimuru would allow it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, there was nowhere to turn.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was still a chance that a great nobleman who controlled the local military could rebel without knowing what to do with himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already sent word to the country. It&rsquo;s about time for the nobles to react, but what&rsquo;s the word from Krishna-dono?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So far, nothing significant has happened. Your younger brother&rsquo;s faction has pledged their loyalty to the new Emperor. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why the others haven&rsquo;t been able to get around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re talking about a move, though. But at least I don&rsquo;t think the former sons of His Majesty the Emperor and the families with blood relatives are going to remain silent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well. Since you&rsquo;re going to advertise that His Majesty Rudra has fallen, some will think it&rsquo;s your turn. And for that, we need Velgrynd-sama&rsquo;s approval&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I would argue that there is no point in saying that the corpse of the Emperor&#39;s room is meaningless. The fools will not even realize making that statement is to make an enemy of Velgrynd-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio thinks that Minits is right, too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Honestly, they weren&rsquo;t afraid of the aristocrats being hostile.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no doubt that Calgurio and his men would win, but the problem would be the decline in national power.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s impostor, or rather Calgurio&rsquo;s real one since he had been in service with him for so long, was planning to bring chaos to the world with invading races called Aggressors.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, it is precisely because Calgurio and the others who have opposed the entity that calls itself Cornu that they understand this threat so well. It was a good thing that Velgrynd had come, or else they would have been wiped out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The being who was Emperor Rudra wanted to become a god himself. The possibility that the emperor&rsquo;s subjects would be used as pawns in his quest could not be ruled out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, no one knew the Emperor&rsquo;s face, so if someone claimed he was Emperor Rudra, they could just stab him in the back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps the enemy would not do such a thing. This is because the Emperor Rudra that Calgurio knew was a hard-hearted man who would not tolerate discussion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have time for quarrels amongst ourselves, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Well, I&rsquo;ll be rooting around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please do. I&rsquo;ll gather the surviving Imperial Knights on my end and reorganize the Imperial Guardians as soon as possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This will be Calgurio&rsquo;s first job as Minister of Military Affairs, but it would be harder than he expected.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, he has to start by finding out how many survivors there still are.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To begin with, Calgurio doesn&rsquo;t know about the missions of all the Imperial Knights. He doesn&rsquo;t know where they are, so he needs to start by contacting them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, some will even try to leave the army.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Krishna was one of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He worships Demon Lord Rimuru like a god and was willing to say that he was retiring and moving to the monster country.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio had asked him to stay until the situation was settled, but he was reluctant to do so. It was Adalman whom Calgurio consulted for advice, and he said to Krishna, &ldquo;Never leave a stone unturned. If the empire remains in turmoil, Rimuru-sama will be saddened.&rdquo; With that, he convinced him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing this, Krishna said, &ldquo;As you wish! You are right, Adalman-sama, what a wonderful speech. I only wanted to be saved. I have to deliver Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s compassion to the innocent subjects of the empire too!&rdquo; He was saying something different from what Caliglio thought, but it was good to know that it worked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They say if you care too much, you will lose.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Krishna wasn&rsquo;t the only one who had expressed a desire to change sides. Some of the Imperial Guard have begun to say they want to stay here in Tempest.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He could understand why they wanted to stay, so he didn&rsquo;t want to impose on them. But that would mean a decline in their forces, and that&rsquo;s why he had to figure out what to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Many of their men died in this battle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was not a matter to be rehashed, since they had it coming, but there was also no reason not to think about how to deal with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were only two survivors of the &lsquo;Single Digits,&rsquo; Bonnie and Jiu.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From now on, however, they would be under the control of Masayuki, acting as his bodyguards. It is more than enough to have Velgrynd, but they would be useful for consulting and for other small tasks, which was why they were able to fulfill Masayuki&rsquo;s request.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio intended to take this opportunity to reform the Emperor&rsquo;s Imperial Guard Knights.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would depend on how many survivors there are, but he would not settle for a hundred. He was going to abolish the hierarchy and stop giving meaning to numbers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A certain amount of strength and loyalty to Emperor are two prerequisites, but Calgurio plans to widen the door a bit in the future.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was going to send them in groups of three to various provincial cities to fortify the Empire&rsquo;s defense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With three men, even if they couldn&rsquo;t compete with the top Aggressors, they could buy some time. Ideally, they should be able to respond flexibly, such as by rushing to their aid.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are more than a hundred cities in the empire, so their numbers are not sufficient at this point in time. There are still some provincial armies left intact, so they&rsquo;d get by for the time being by coordinating with others.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At any rate&hellip;he was prepared to focus on those who had reached the Sage class&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough on us both&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. But it&rsquo;s been strangely rewarding.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Minits muttered this to himself as he popped his drink, Calgurio nodded his head in agreement. And so, the words spilled out, but they were surprisingly Calgurio&rsquo;s true feelings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The feeling of working for the Empire had brought Calgurio more fulfilling days than when he had only thought about move up in the military.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Besides, now that we have heard of His Majesty Rimuru&rsquo;s plans, it is imperative to restore security and political stability to the Empire. If we don&rsquo;t get on board, we will be left behind in the future world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Rimuru and Masayuki&rsquo;s approval, construction of the railroad begins. Perhaps in less than a few years, they could see a future in which the transportation network would be completed in the empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The stories he&rsquo;d been told at the meeting alone were shuddering, but there was more to the story.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And that thing. Plans to control the skies of the world, right? That man is outrageous. I know he said it over drinks, but I&rsquo;m told he doesn&rsquo;t get drunk. So that means he meant what he said.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. Zamud seemed to have been inspired by it, too, since he volunteered to help. Well, he&rsquo;s more of an engineer than a soldier, so that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s really all about.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it possible to connect countries with a &ldquo;Magic Train&rdquo; on the ground and mass-produce airspace in the sky to stabilize the sales channels? It&rsquo;s a frightening idea, but it will be realized. After all, the only thing they asked for in compensation for this defeat was &lsquo;airspace rights.&rsquo; And rather than not needing anything else, he even provided us support. How can we refuse them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, since His Majesty Masayuki approved. What&rsquo;s important is the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that said, Calgurio thinks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">This country is weird</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The remarks of Demon Lord Rimuru, who says that he has an idea, would be put into a feasible plan the very next day, if not within the same day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The plan to mass-produce the airships had been planned from the moment he learned that the Empire owned it, but it was still unusual for them to prepare a development base for it so easily.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A floor in the labyrinth has now become a place to improve the airships.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zamud works there happily, and he says every day that this is where heaven was found because he can get as much material as he wants without worrying about the budget.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The excitement of being back from the dead seems to have added to that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio envies Zamud for being so obedient to his own desires, but he can only wish Zamud good luck in maintaining the friendship between Tempest and the Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aside from Zamud, the important things is the future.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s vision, it seemed that he would be willing to help with maintenance within the Empire as well. Now that the Empire&rsquo;s power has declined, there was no choice but to take advantage of this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Empire could provide the labor as well, so he doesn&rsquo;t intend to make it a relationship where they can only rely on them. In that regard, Calgurio thinks very differently from the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is an intelligent man capable of making calm judgment as long as he is not blinded by lust.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, he came to the conclusion that domestic stabilization was the priority when considering what was needed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The empire is not in shambles at present.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the details of the defeat would undoubtedly unsettle the subjects.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A fallen family would see Demon Lord Rimuru as an enemy to be reckoned with. Krishna and others are taking steps to prevent this from happening, but Calgurio must also take action.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also, as Minits is wary of, the movements of the higher nobles are a cause for concern.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they are to grow, they must welcome the Tempest forces into the empire to ensure that they don&rsquo;t run into the wrong people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are a lot of problems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big responsibility.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. But Calgurio&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s His Majesty Rimuru who has it harder than we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; Calgurio thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When asked about their plans for future development, they had desperately started to move accordingly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;s only natural.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Restoring their country&rsquo;s security and developing it is not a job that they have been ordered to do. It is a job that they should work hard at every day while wishing for the betterment of their own country.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A conflict with Aggressors are inevitable in the near future. And yet, they have realized that they feel little concern about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s all because they had been given so much to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buried in them, the anxiety was dispersed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. He just didn&rsquo;t want us to worry&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I suppose so, but maybe that&rsquo;s not all there is to it. Maybe His Majesty Rimuru intends to take care of the Aggressors on his own. Or maybe he doesn&rsquo;t think of them as much of a problem, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was bound to be a big deal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet Lord Rimuru spoke more about future developments than the aforementioned subject.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio and the Minits were impressed by his noble imposing attitude.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps it was the same with King Gazel as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To Demon Lord Rimuru, Aggressors were nothing more than a trivial matter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Was that vanity or genuineness?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits thinks it&rsquo;s Rimuru&rsquo;s way of saying he doesn&rsquo;t want Calgurio and the others to be worried.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Calgurio can&rsquo;t help but think the same way as Minits.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">If we really want to deal with the Aggressors on our own, then we should find something we can do to help. At the very least, we must stop anyone from causing a civil war and dragging us down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio is ready to go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio and Minits left the restaurant after drinking for about an hour.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next day, they left for home after setting up Masayuki as a portable shrine.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back in the Imperial Capital, Calgurio has a busy day ahead of him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are some damaged areas around the capital, but there was no need to do anything right now to rebuild. That&rsquo;s because it was going to be done by collaboration with Rimuru and his team.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the first priority was to reorganize the military.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The generals who survived&mdash;those who all came back to life&mdash;are all back home, and have been given a new mission.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In any case, the first priority was to keep the peace, and taking into account the report from Krishna, he sent his troops to the unsettled provinces to warn them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fortunately, the 700,000 soldiers were loyal to Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even those who wanted to settle in the monster country were cooperative this time. That was because Demon Lord Rimuru had promised to hire them after the turmoil was over.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, you can think it over instead of just deciding right away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He gathered the soldiers in the arena and gave a speech.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Rigurd had explained the detailed conditions of settlement, Rimuru had told them himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, Rimuru didn&rsquo;t try to persuade anyone, but he did leave it up to the individual&rsquo;s will, and about 200,000 people who heard his speech were motivated to move on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aggressor races, huh? I&rsquo;m going to beat them to a pulp!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, well, the fighting spirit was growing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although they lost their &lsquo;soul&rsquo; power, their bodies were still altered. Even now, some of them can rival A-ranked players and are a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is how Calgurio wants to somehow stabilize the imperial capital. But here, an even bigger problem arose.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The real trouble was the nobles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no end to the number of nobles seeking to meet with them, and this was putting a strain on Calgurio&rsquo;s work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if he wanted to decline, there were some big names that might be useful in the future.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits&rsquo; lobbying and Krishna&rsquo;s persuasion helped, and no major disruptions occurred, but it was certainly a drain on their spirits.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Demon Lord Rimuru dispatched a helping hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Testarossa, the beautiful white (Blanc) demon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first thing Testarossa did was deliver a speech to control the people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Completely ignoring the nobles, she appeased the subjects who had not yet come to terms with the shock of defeat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seemed like a task unsuitable for these fear-mongering demons. However, it wasn&rsquo;t surprising. Demons feed on emotions, so they were perfect for relieving the fear and anxiety of the subjects.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised. I never thought that the White Primordial (Blanc)</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">Testarossa-dono, who once tormented the empire, would care so much about the people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. It is my job that I have been given by our king, Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but it&rsquo;s more, pardon me, rough, because I didn&rsquo;t expect such measures to be adopted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio gives his thoughts as he sheds greasy sweat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He regretted it right after he said it, thinking it was too straightforward, but Testarossa let it slide without a second thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let bad publicity get in the way of Rimuru-sama, in any unlikely event. We can be cautious, but that wouldn&rsquo;t be as effective. And it&rsquo;s hard to adjust? Eating up all the emotions can have a detrimental effect on you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio paled in thought, but Testarossa would never make such a mistake. She told Moss to control her subordinates, and success was guaranteed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But her words were also true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is difficult to control people&rsquo;s emotions with moderate methods alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The deaths of their relatives and the transfer of the throne from Rudra to Masayuki confused the subjects. Not all the sorrow of the subjects has disappeared, and there are still seeds of anxiety and dissatisfaction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In that regard, Calgurio&rsquo;s deployment of security forces in various locations had prevented riots and skirmishes from occurring.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like it, it&rsquo;s easier to kill everyone in your family if you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha, ha. You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not a joke,&rsquo; Calgurio thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He knew that the White Primordial (Blanc) was trouble. This strengthened his respect for Rimuru who can control Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The subjects have calmed down to some extent, and fortunately no one was foolish enough to rise up in arms.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Relieved at this point, Testarossa had the next move in mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They decided to unveil the new Emperor Masayuki as the quickest and most effective way to provide mental care for the people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The point is, it was a coronation ceremony for him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Testarossa thought that if Masayuki gave a speech on the occasion, his subjects would feel that a new era had arrived.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What, me!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is there a problem?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;nothing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was willing to accept it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were tears in his eyes, but they were worthless in front of Testarossa&rsquo;s smile.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh my, how dare you make Masayuki cry?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To which Testarossa replied flatly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I have no taste for such things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two beautiful women looking at each other with smiles on their faces.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Their gazes clash, and a terrible pressure was being exerted.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is mainly Masayuki and Calgurio who suffer the damage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Praying to go back home, Masayuki passes it by.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio overcame the crisis by emptying his mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, Masayuki&rsquo;s coronation became a reality.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Countless subjects filled the square in front of the Imperial Castle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking down on them, Masayuki stood on a balcony in the upper part of the castle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He came to the empire with Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Transfer,&rsquo;

Masayuki was crowned as the new Emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Masayuki&rsquo;s intercession has established peace with the monster kingdom, and he would seek to improve the relationship between the two sides in the future.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Along with this, diplomatic relations have been established with the Dwarven Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to shut down Michael&rsquo;s &lsquo;Castle Guard,&rsquo; they needed to convince the subjects that Rudra was the source of all evil. Pretend he was dead, and the number of people who believe in Rudra would be reduced.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he introduced Masayuki as the new emperor, but many people were confused as to how that could be possible without any blood relation. To convince them, Velgrynd steps forward.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Calm yourselves, fools. My name is Velgrynd, the &ldquo;Scorch Dragon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The subjects were upset when they were told the same name as the Empire&rsquo;s guardian dragon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&lsquo;No way</span><span class="c9">&rsquo;&mdash;</span><span class="c0">was what was going through everyone&rsquo;s minds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In accordance with the Imperial Code of Ethics, I hereby appoint Chosen Hero Masayuki as the new Emperor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that declaration, Velgrynd visibly unleashed her overwhelming supremacy. A divine crimson cardinal aura is visible to all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, she held out her hand in a certain direction and called out to the subjects.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Behold. A salute to the new Emperor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As she finished, the Flaming God Mountain erupted into flames. This massive eruption was clearly visible from the Imperial Capital.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What would be too horrific to even call a cannonball was no less than a joke to Velgrynd. But the astonishment of the subjects who saw it was beyond words.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one doubted it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One might say it was a premeditated situation &nbsp;and triggered to erupt with magic or bombs&mdash;but the volcano was god&rsquo;s mountain. One had no idea what kind of anger they might incur if they did so without asking permission from the mountain&rsquo;s resident Scorch Dragon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one in the Imperial City would dare to act so recklessly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s not all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Several volcanic bombs had landed on the imperial city, but they were all flung off by an invisible barrier.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was truly the true nature of the guardian dragon!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A-a god&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s real!

The subjects finally understand that Chosen Hero Masayuki has truly become an emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Masayuki was well known in the Eastern Empire, though not as well-known in the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh my gosh, really!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Shining Masayuki!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the greatest Chosen Hero in the world? Of course, even Demon Lord Rimuru can&rsquo;t resist!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The impression that was heard somewhere flies around, as if members of a theater company were spreading it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is the quality of Masayuki. He is famous everywhere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this time, Masayuki&rsquo;s power has been enhanced. The effect was far-reaching and had a huge impact on those who knew him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a result, there was the usual cheers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Ma-sa-yu-ki! Ma-sa-yu-ki</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The cheers were so harmonious that it seemed as if the voices of the subjects were united.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd and others said, &ldquo;Fools. It&rsquo;s so impolite to call the Emperor by his name&rdquo; they thought, but Masayuki himself was not angry, so he acquiesced.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Testarossa who was the most upset.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The empire&#39;s subjects misunderstood that Demon Lord Rimuru couldn&#39;t resist Masayuki, and she had the feeling that she would boil over if this continued, but this was a plan drawn by Testarossa herself. There was no one to complain about, so she had to put up with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, it was very easy for Masayuki to be accepted by his subjects in the Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And on that day, he was proclaimed to the nations of the world as &ldquo;Emperor&rdquo; of the Eastern Empire, the Nasca Namrium Ulmeria United Eastern Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The subjects of the Imperial City have been revitalized by the newfound hope.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The grief of those who have lost their loved ones would not heal quickly, but they have begun to move forward.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their daily lives are returning to normal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio knew it was all the more gratifying.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the days of true rest were far from over.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A troublesome opponent, the nobility, was on the move now that the new Emperor had been officially appointed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Minits in charge, he&rsquo;d like to leave the highborn to their own devices, but it was for Calgurio&rsquo;s convenience, and the nobles don&rsquo;t care who is in charge of the new emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why the requests for visits are always coming in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When he looked at Testarossa for help, she said without a care in the world,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;These are the noblemen of this country, but I&rsquo;m sure most of them won&rsquo;t be a problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio had no idea what that meant, but he understood that Testarossa was behind it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Minits was working on his job, Calgurio decided to focus on what he could do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, within days, the requests for visits began to dwindle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Excuse me sir, but Testarossa-dono, but, well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio wondered if she had threatened them, but he couldn&rsquo;t say it out loud.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The lady sipping her tea elegantly in front of him was the White Primordial (Blanc), long feared by the Empire. It&rsquo;s hard to believe even if told, but it&rsquo;s an undeniable fact.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why it was no surprise that she was using some terrifying method.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, excuse me. Why do you look at me with such terror? I&rsquo;ve never done anything wrong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s what all bad people think.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But saying it was different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was impossible for Calgurio, who felt so cramped in his own office, to tell the queen-like Testarossa what he really thought of her, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s unavoidable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, hahahaha, I&rsquo;m not doubting you. I&rsquo;m grateful every day that you&rsquo;ve been such a great help. And so, I&rsquo;m just wondering how you managed to keep the noblemen quiet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about that and just go about your business.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Testarossa sipped her tea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then she let out one elegant sigh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, all right. I&rsquo;ll feel awkward taking credit for it, so I&rsquo;ll let you know. As I told you before, the nobles weren&rsquo;t much of a problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, why is that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;First of all, the nobles of this empire were divided into three major factions. Of course, you knew that, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. The warlord aristocracy, led by the Marquis family, Minits&rsquo; family, was the central figure of the Emperor faction. The rest are the local nobility.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The military, a powerful organization, was the cornerstone of the empire. There were many nobles who joined its steadfast authority, and the warlord nobles boasted great power. The marquis, the second highest-ranking nobleman, was the head of this faction, which meant that few high-ranking nobles participated in it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In contrast, the aristocracy was dominated by those with ties to the Emperor. This faction symbolizes the authority of the aristocracy in that they must be at least an earl or higher to have a say in the matter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The provincial aristocracy is the least coherent faction. They are made up of nobles who individually have no voice in the opinions that suit them. It could be said that they are only one faction because their interests are aligned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At Calgurio&rsquo;s explanation, Testarossa nodded lightly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The warlord aristocracy first, but this was like the Minits were in control of it, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, Minits and his younger brother don&rsquo;t get along&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No. Yhat thing was, you know, just sulking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;You were almost overwhelmed by the sense of responsibility when your respected brother gave the marquis house. So, by rebelling and showing it, he was telling himself that he could protect his physical appearance while still being able to convince himself.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt38" id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Well, that sounds like a weak human story&rsquo;&mdash;and Testarossa replied with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that true? I mean, how did you find out that it was&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Se-cr-et.

I&rsquo;m from a lowly provincial aristocracy so I knew, but I don&rsquo;t think that even your average high ranking soldier knows that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, his answer is not a perfect score.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are other local crafts and specialties that can be done by hand, but he doesn&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right answer. Calgurio doesn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s the kind of person to make such a fuss, and praises Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is the right answer, then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s black-market trade.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio answers unintentionally.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no such thing as a black market in this empire. Just believing that, he was astonished by the imposing answer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, is it strange?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course it is! The Empire, under the authority of His Majesty, stands for equality for all. Noblemen, of course, are exempt, but even commoners have a chance at promotion in the military.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;m not talking about the surface of it, but the practical side of it. The black market is essential. Do you know why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if you say it&rsquo;s mandatory, he knows that Testarossa is serious. But Calgurio couldn&rsquo;t help but be disbelieving.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the traitorousness of the Emperor&rsquo;s black market is so widespread, the Imperial Intelligence could not have been ignorant of it. It would not have gone unnoticed by the late Lieutenant Kondou, for that matter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was even called an &ldquo;intelligence monster,&rdquo; a man who was feared. And he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel that the injustice therein had been left unchecked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Unbelievable. Kondou-dono missed the wrongdoing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He muttered to himself, and Testarossa looked at Calgurio in dismay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so stiff. You missed it because it wasn&rsquo;t a bad thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It sounds nice to be a nobleman&rsquo;s maid, but power relationship is determined by the rank of the employer. Do you think a merchant of a lower class can compete with a merchant of a higher class?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The answer is, it&rsquo;s impossible. When you&rsquo;re powerful, you have to do as you&rsquo;re told. That&rsquo;s where the black market comes in. The reason &lsquo;Echidna&rsquo; and its successor, &lsquo;Cerberus,&rsquo; the Imperial underworld societies, existed, is because there was a need for them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was an eye-opener for Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;A merchant must be free,&rsquo; Testarossa says. A fixed salary is not enough to really pursue profit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To bind them by force would only provoke a rebellion, and that would get the people into trouble before that. It is because he understood that that Kondou did not seriously interfere in the underworld.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So was human trafficking, which is officially banned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When famine or other famine-hit villages are unable to eat, they must be reduced in size. Legally, it&rsquo;s considered evil, but if they don&rsquo;t do it, many will die. In such cases, selling to the black market was more likely to increase the chances of survival than killing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s an extreme example, but it&rsquo;s a fact that this had been done several times in the history of the Empire. There were many other inconvenient realities that had been overlooked as open secrets.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of the larger issues include foreign trade.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as the empire does not tolerate the existence of other countries, trade and the like are publicly forbidden. But that&rsquo;s the problem with the economy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why &ldquo;Cerberus&rdquo; and the like had their roots in the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Testarossa explains these facts matter-of-factly. Hearing this, Calgurio wonders how the demon knows so much, and also feels sad because he feels like an idiot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you for the detailed explanation. It helped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good. Well, that&rsquo;s why the local nobles were so easy. When I explained to them that free trade would be allowed from now on, they agreed with me in an assortment of ways. Besides, if Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s project proceeds, there will be railroads between the provincial cities as well. They promised me that they would support Emperor Masayuki to the fullest because the wealth will be distributed to the regions instead of being centralized.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Testarossa concluded.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio is understandably convinced.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">The empire is also a highly developed scientific civilization, but it does not have the luxury of connecting all the urban areas. The reason for this is obvious</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">most of the budget is used for development and military spending.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The transportation of food and supplies is also important, but it can only be provided in the cities around the capital. Goods were brought in from distant regions by magic and airships.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even those regions that were on the back burner would be included in the development plan. If they had been told, it would have been easy to make the local lords happy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The negotiations were based on the premise of enormous financial and labor forces, but it was Demon Lord Rimuru and Testarossa who made it possible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Investigate the other party&#39;s circumstances and make negotiations advantageous. Although it was faithful to the basics, Calgurio was deeply impressed with how amazing it was when thoroughly implemented.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He vowed to rethink the way he had been doing things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then, the only factions left are the nobles famlies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And since it&rsquo;s Testarossa-dono, I assume you already know what they&rsquo;re up to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this point, Calgurio has full confidence in Testarossa. He doesn&rsquo;t know what kind of plan they have up their sleeves, but if it&rsquo;s Testarossa, then there won&rsquo;t be a problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pardon me. To begin with, there weren&rsquo;t any fools in the Empire these days who were doing bad things. The stagnant air has been swept away in the last few decades, but it turns out it was Kondou&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, the real villains have already been purged.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Testarossa has been with the Empire for a long time, but lately Calgurio feels that the people are more stable than ever before. Now he sees why.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The spiteful evil-doers were gone. The only ones left now were the secret societies that were considered a necessary evil and the petty villains that could be left alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then, how do you suggest them to persuade the nobles?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There is a meeting this afternoon. That&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re going to settle this, so I hope you&rsquo;ll join us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was definitely an order.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Originally, he was supposed to be a collaborator, but Calgurio had no complaints.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He nodded at Testarossa&rsquo;s words in the face of a clear difference in ability.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only four people meet in the reception room.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The host, Prime Minister Minits.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio, the Minister of Military Affairs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A diplomatic officer and future ally from the monster kingdom, Testarossa, will be present.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the last of these is the negotiator, Duke Mithra Hillmenard with his faction of noblemen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was still young in his early 30s, and one might think he would be too young to be the head of a faction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that doesn&rsquo;t apply to Mithra.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is a person who has everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra&rsquo;s mother was once the emperor&rsquo;s queen. She was, in fact, Rudra&rsquo;s birth mother.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The imperial family has a special system in place that does not have an empress who is to be called the emperor&rsquo;s wife. That position was reserved for Velgrynd alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Instead, some women vied for supremacy in the palace&rsquo;s back rooms as empresses. These were daughters voluntarily given by the nobility, whose bloodline was unmistakably noble.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whoever carries the Emperor&rsquo;s child will be crowned the victor and will be named Queen. After all, the child is sure to become the next Emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incidentally, as a digression, there were also several queens in Rudra&rsquo;s palace, but Rudra does not recognize them. It was the arbitrary decision of the noblemen who wanted their daughters to be queen, and this time it was dissolved. There was an idea that the new Emperor would take over it, but it was judged to be unnecessary for Masayuki. Who made that decision will forever remain a mystery&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back to the topic at hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra&rsquo;s mother was the winner. She had fulfilled the great task of giving birth to Rudra and had achieved great fame.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a reward, she was given two choices.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She could remain in the palace and allow Rudra to grow into a man of her own choosing, or she could marry into a family of her choice with an enormous sum of money.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Emperor&rsquo;s treatment of his birth mother is of the highest order. She had a great deal of say in the matter and would not be despised even if she had left the palace. So she did not hesitate to leave the palace and marry the former Duke Hillmenard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the one who was born between them was Mithra Hillmenard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is the half-brother of Emperor Rudra. His unwavering authority alone was enough to bring all around him to their knees.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A mask of cruelty intimidates all who see it. With no eyebrows and a horrifying gaze that would have been frightening to anyone who saw it, any desire to rebel was diminished.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is neither fat nor thin. He&rsquo;s not tall, but his intimidation is impressive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This guy must be doing bad things behind the scenes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Not good.&rsquo; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s one we should not cross&hellip;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;And so on. Many of the higher nobles felt that way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s exactly why he was the right man to be the head of the nobles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man with a dignity no one could resist, that was Duke Mithra Hillmenard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it was only strength alone, Calgurio would win without a doubt. There was no doubt about that, even before he awakened.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the world does not live by strength alone. If there is no one to provide food, clothing, and shelter, there can be no comfort. If one defied Mithra, they were bound to lose it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">He&rsquo;s an extremely troublesome opponent. I wanted to be at the top of the army, too, but when it comes right down to it, it&rsquo;s a hard thing to live with. I&rsquo;m going to have to bargain with this monster.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He thought to himself, without saying it out loud.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe with Minits there, he could work something out, but he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to negotiate one-on-one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this time, he has a reliable helper.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Testarossa-dono is a fearsome being, but she&rsquo;s encouraging as an ally. Knowing that she&rsquo;s the fearsome White Primordial, makes me feel that we can&rsquo;t lose.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra was scary in front of Calgurio, but Testarossa was even scarier. With that in mind, he was able to regain his composure.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio regained his composure and remembered the words of Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Wait? Testarossa-dono had said that most of the nobles wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. So was Mithra-dono the problematic aristocrat? No, that&rsquo;s a strange story too&hellip;Kondou would not have tolerated the Emperor&rsquo;s half-brother. Could it be that Mithra-dono has done nothing wrong?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No way. That&rsquo;s a bit of a stretch.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not likely,&rsquo; says Calgurio, denying his own beliefs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra is feared by all because he is untouchable and evil. A man who makes one think they are a nuisance cannot be an ordinary person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then the hands of the clock struck the hour.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A loud ringing of the bell sounded.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the signal for the meeting to begin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The rogues who seek to usurp the throne. Shall I ask you why you have summoned me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That magnificent question belongs to Mithra.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits takes it softly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please wait, my lord. That&rsquo;s a misunderstanding.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is this misunderstanding. Isn&rsquo;t it true?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We have followed the official procedure according to the Imperial Code of Ethics. Therefore, I would ask you to withdraw the word &lsquo;usurpation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will vomit. Don&rsquo;t let it go to your head just because you&rsquo;ve got Velgrynd-sama on your side!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits denied it out loud.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the calm Minits couldn&rsquo;t help but be overlooked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, it&rsquo;s really outrageous, and even Calgurio is upset.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Certainly, to an outsider, it would seem that Velgrynd has sided with them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;s a big misunderstanding.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rather, it&rsquo;s the opposite.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is only keeping the peace by currying favor with Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Words and deeds can get one killed, but that&rsquo;s no longer the case with Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This country might really disappear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not an exaggeration or anything, but it really could disappear from the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It all depended on Masayuki&rsquo;s mood.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a good thing that Masayuki was a kind person, but he shuddered to think of what he would have done if he had been a selfish person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mithra-dono, Minits is correct. Although Velgrynd-Sama is an ally of His Majesty, she is not an ally of the Empire. If it is His Majesty&rsquo;s wish, she would have no hesitation in destroying the Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That one actually said that if it would be a burden His Majesty Masayuki, then she&rsquo;d let the country be burnt to the ground. We must never offend her!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You expect me to believe that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s no wonder you can&rsquo;t believe it, so we would like to hear your opinion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kekeke, are you ruling over the Empire, or are you hostile?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra asks irreverently, and Minits denies it immediately.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he goes on to say what he really thinks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay? I don&rsquo;t want this to come out, but I want you to know what I&rsquo;m really thinking, sir.

If you want my opinion, then just tell me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then, let&rsquo;s start with the question first. Mithra, my lord, do you want to rule the Empire? Or do you want to work hand in hand with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The question from Minits was unexpected, even for Mithra. Just as he had been bracing himself for the kind of negotiations that were about to unfold, it sounded as if they were willing to surrender control of the Empire to Mithra.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, that perception was correct.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits himself had been forced to accept the position of Prime Minister by chance. If Mithra wishes it here, he was willing to give it up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His first priority was to stabilize the empire. And now that this was largely accomplished, it was Minits&rsquo; opinion that there was still room for change in terms of how the political system would be structured in the future.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calgurio is also aware of Minits&rsquo; thought process.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Indeed, he is willing to help unite the Imperial nobility. If I turned it over to Mithra-dono here, he would not have made a mistake, but that would be unfair, wouldn&rsquo;t it, Minits?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s why his younger brother will resent him,&rsquo; Calgurio thought to himself, gritting his teeth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;d even give up your position as Prime Minister to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you for being so quick to understand. Now may I tell you what I think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra, perhaps sensing a lack of information, reluctantly nodded his head.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In response, Minits began to speak.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The basic premise is that Masayuki himself did not want the position of Emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if he left the empire unattended here, political unrest could cause a great deal of confusion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was also an unknown enemy and leaving that unattended would put everyone in trouble. Therefore, the Monster Kingdom and the Dwarven Kingdom welcomed Masayuki to become the Emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd only obeys the will of Masayuki. It means that if Masayuki does not become Emperor, she will easily abandon the Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even without Velgrynd&rsquo;s help, the loss of the dragon guardian&rsquo;s blessing is a big problem. If that was the case, then it was in the best interest of the people of the Empire to have Masayuki on the throne at all costs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As I said before, His Majesty Masayuki himself feels that the imperial throne is a burden. I&rsquo;m sure he wouldn&rsquo;t mind having someone else to do the honors for him, rather he would be welcome to it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits concluded.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I see&rsquo;&hellip; and Mithra was convinced.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He understood that all that mattered was Velgrynd&rsquo;s mood.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he does not keep Masayuki on the throne, even Velgrynd will leave the Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If so, it certainly doesn&#39;t matter who is in politics.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rather, it is in the Empire&rsquo;s best interest to not bind Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is Demon Lord Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s intention to build a good relationship with Masayuki-sama. If Masayuki-sama is to be Emperor, he will provide as much support as possible. So, I hope you understands that saying &lsquo;usurpation of the throne&rsquo; is out of line.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a bewitching smile, Testarossa also joined in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, this information was already known to Mithra.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is also known that Demon Lord Rimuru did not demand great reparations from the empire that was defeated in the war.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s goal is also to ensure future friendship. If so, Mithra himself thought that there was no room for doubt in Testarossa&rsquo;s statement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then what was the right thing to do?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were two options. But he doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to choose one or the other. If there&rsquo;s another way, he&rsquo;s free to choose it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However&mdash; Mithra seems to have given up halfway, thinking that it would be difficult to win&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Will Mithra lead the government as Prime Minister or will he appoint Minits to lead the nobles?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Actually, this was of no interest to Mithra.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All Mithra really wanted to do was stay at home and paint as he pleases.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With his noble lineage and the authority of the Duke family, Mithra was considered a born ruler.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that was a great misunderstanding.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To begin with, Mithra&rsquo;s mother had good looks that made her beloved by the Emperor. She had a vague resemblance to Velgrynd and was a strong woman.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, that was just on the outside.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her appearance might have been misleading, but she was in fact a quiet woman. Otherwise, when she gave birth to Rudra, she would have been the empress in her own right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a luxury allowed to a mother for a short time while Rudra grew up. She must have been quite an eccentric, because she chose not to do so and instead wished for her freedom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then she was discovered by Duke Balsa Hillmenard, Mithra&rsquo;s father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Balsa was a handsome man. So it is generally believed that Mithra&rsquo;s mother made a pass at him. Perhaps he was pushed aside by the queen&rsquo;s selfishness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;s not true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Truthfully, it was Balsa who made the passive overture.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They loved each other and Mithra was born. They are still in love today, but that&rsquo;s beside the point.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">I don&rsquo;t want to do politics, either. I&rsquo;m tired of these suckers. But&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To Mithra&rsquo;s dismay, he was surprisingly popular. On top of that, he&rsquo;s smart and has never been caught up in a conspiracy before.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Mithra has so many followers, and they sometimes gets ahead of themselves in things he does not want them to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The worst was the downfall of a count.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That day, Mithra&rsquo;s shoulder bumped into the Count&rsquo;s. It was a careless accident, but the Count didn&rsquo;t apologize.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra was still in his early 20s and the other man must have taken him for a fool. Maybe if he&rsquo;d known Mithra was Duke&rsquo;s son, he might have reacted differently, but it was too late.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You! I&rsquo;m a Count! Don&rsquo;t you have any sense of propriety!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He remembers watching the man calmly as he shouted at him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was reminded of a story he had heard from a friend from another world, saying that this person might not have enough calcium to get so angry at such a thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then Mithra muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra had not yet succeeded to the Duke&rsquo;s seat, and the current Count was in a superior position. However, he had been taught never to bow to a lower-ranked person, and he was wondering what to do in this situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&lsquo;I&#39;m in trouble&rsquo;</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">With that one sentence, it would develop into a really troublesome case.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mithra-sama is in trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How dare the Count embarrass Mithra-sama. Oh, dear. What a horrible mistake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then Mithra&rsquo;s friends got into a frenzy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t know where they had been hiding, but immediately after that, knights in black showed up in a hurry. And several of them restrained the Count.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, ah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only then did the panicked Count realize who Mithra was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was already too late.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The captain bowed to Mithra and told him,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please leave this person&#39;s disposal to us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll leave it to you&rdquo;&mdash;It was Mithra who had no choice but to say so.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next day&rsquo;s newspapers laid out the evidence of the Count&rsquo;s deceit. Whether it was a true crime or a fabricated one, Mithra would never know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All that is certain is that the Count had been arrested and his title was vacated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Needless to say, the fear of Mithra from those around him had grown.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One bump on the shoulder can destroy an opponent. It was an incident that Mithra would never forget, as he realized he had the power to do just that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There had been similar incidents since then, and despite having no intention of doing so, Mithra had come to reign as a fearsome nobleman.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because of that, Mithra knows how to speak up for himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why it became so quiet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to the investigation of the best agents under the Duke&rsquo;s, it seems that Rudra&rsquo;s disappearance is certain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whether he was dead or ran away doesn&rsquo;t matter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What mattered was that Velgrynd, the Empire&rsquo;s guardian dragon, had endorsed Chosen Hero Masayuki as the new Emperor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c6">It is assumed that the mysterious Marshal is actually &ldquo;Scorch Dragon&rdquo; Velgrynd-sama. And it is likely that the man to whom she is attached to is the true successor of Rudra-sama&rsquo;s soul</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was what the report stated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyone with even a modicum of intelligence to think against this would understand that it&rsquo;s impossible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Empire&rsquo;s succession to the throne is different from others in that it doesn&rsquo;t place much importance on bloodlines. No, it may be considered important to the public, but to the truly noble ones, Rudra&rsquo;s soul was what was most important.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Duke, Mithra, naturally understood this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">This&hellip;if things go wrong, not only will it destroy my, it will destroy everything. It&rsquo;s not safe for my men to be out of control. I must make up my mind and make my move.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was only natural for the wise Mithra to make this decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ideally, he would have wanted to stay out of politics and still keep his influence over the nobles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If his current title is secured in the future, then he wouldn&rsquo;t have to struggle financially. Even if he didn&rsquo;t force himself to participate in politics, he could still dream taking a stipend and living a life of painting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If this is the best thing that could happen, the next best thing would be to stay in the countryside.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be better to manage the estate and live as a provincial lord. That would keep him busy for a bit but still leave him time to paint. He wouldn&rsquo;t have to socialize too much, so it was a good place to start.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The worst thing that could happen would be to touch Velgrynd&rsquo;s reverse scale.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that would be useless.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now is the time to prevent that from happening.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra decides to make a plan here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wants to use his bad reputation and aim for his expulsion from the capital.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he acts arrogant, or rather, if he speaks as he normally would, his opponents would find Mithra troubling. Then after it&rsquo;s all over, he can just reason about what he&rsquo;s doing, pretend to be angry about it all, and leave.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Negotiations would break down. But Mithra would realize his disadvantage and slip away from the capital to the provinces.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the story he had planned to tell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, Minits gave him two incomprehensible choices.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you want to control the Empire? Or do you want to work hand in hand with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The answer is to refuse both.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that wouldn&rsquo;t be nice to say.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra ponders.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The conversation of Minits continued.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Testarossa, a diplomat from the monster country, has joined them to prove their legitimacy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He knows this without being told.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Knowing all the facts was the basis of the negotiations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Now, what can I do? Those are two choices, and I don&rsquo;t want to take either one. Being in politics in this country as it stands now is a straight line to death. If I work any more hours, I won&rsquo;t have time to paint or play with my beloved daughter!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra has a daughter whom he loves.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is only three years old. So cute.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He also has a newborn son.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What he was wondering about was his wife, who couldn&rsquo;t even look at Mithra after his son was born.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The daughter of the Marquis family, whom Mithra had fallen in love with at first sight. A woman who came to live with him the day after he asked her to be his wife.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She who had become of a thoughtful wife, has been a source of anxiety for Mithra as of late.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although she had been distant from the beginning of their marriage, he thought it couldn&rsquo;t be helped since they had just begun to get used to each other. Their daughter was born smoothly and they were expecting a boy. He was hoping they would slowly grow in love with each other at this rate&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">Yes. I have to say no, or I&rsquo;d lose the time to talk to my wife. I don&rsquo;t care what happens to the empire, but I have to prevent my family from becoming unhappy!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra again made up his mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had planned to settle the matter amicably today, but a little turbulence was inevitable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now he has his &lsquo;answer&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ridiculous. Isn&rsquo;t this a usurpation of the throne? Sleep when you talk in your sleep. And Testarossa-dono, was it? What right do you have to meddle in the domestic affairs of our Empire? It&rsquo;s true that the Empire was defeated in a war. But by renouncing the airspace rights and making a treaty between nations, you have established peace between the Empire and your country. Now that you&rsquo;ve established diplomatic relations, are you saying that you have the right to interfere with the sovereignty of a friendly nation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a dangerous gamble. And yet, Mithra decided to take the plunge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has trapped a demon lord&rsquo;s diplomat with formidable power. She is the Demon Lord&rsquo;s plenipotentiary abroad and there is no denying the possibility of another war if she is offended.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra knows that she is the White Primordial (Blanc). He knows that he is speaking outrageously against the great demon feared by the Empire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh my, did I go too far in my imitation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Humph! I won&rsquo;t ask you to leave this room. I&rsquo;m sure your master would like to know what the friendly country&rsquo;s future plans are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I appreciate your concern, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Come on, get angry! He wished that she would but was so confused that she easily swept it along.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">I thought if I told them that, they would move to exclude me&hellip;but what do they think?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was wondering what he should do if she was enraged, but this calmness is confusing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Too much anger and he&rsquo;d lose his life. Since he felt his life was about to be cut short even with that comment, it was unthinkable to make any more aggressive comments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">What do I say? Do I want to take it another step further?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That step was scary to no end.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, he would turn the tables on them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am the great Rudra&rsquo;s half-brother. Now that the life or death of my older half-brother is unknown, you would shamelessly ask for my help by choosing to welcome a new emperor, a man from nowhere named Masayuki? I have no idea what you&rsquo;re thinking!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra burst into a rush just a little more emphatically than usual.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Depending on this reaction, the situation would be changed promptly. This is where the real fight begins.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">But unfortunately</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">Mithra&rsquo;s gamble turned out in the worst possible way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh my, do you disagree with my decision? If you think you&rsquo;re going to be overlooked just because you&rsquo;re related to Rudra, I&rsquo;m going to have to tell you that you&rsquo;re too naive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Gah, geez, Velgrynd-sama</span><span class="c9 c16">&mdash;!?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An unspeakable scream erupted from Mithra&rsquo;s heart.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra was so shocked that his soul felt as if it was going to slip out of his mouth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The odds were no longer stacked against him, but rather were completely against him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For some reason, Mithra felt refreshed that it was over for him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe that&rsquo;s why he felt like it was the time to say what he wanted to say.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Marshal-dono</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">no, it&rsquo;s Velgrynd-sama, the guardian dragon of the empire, isn&rsquo;t it? I was not told that you would be attending today&rsquo;s meeting, but it is a pleasure to meet you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First of all, the appeal is not that big a deal?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He really wanted to run away, but was enlightened by the fact that it was impossible anyway.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry. I really don&rsquo;t think being the Emperor is a party, either. But when I think about the people who live in the Empire, I think it&rsquo;s best for me to be the Emperor&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Following Velgrynd, who opened the door without a sound and entered the room, Masayuki also appeared.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Mithra, it was completely unexpected.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Judging from the situation, he had no choice but to realize that his fate was completely sealed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, there was one thing that bothered him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh? Your Majesty doesn&rsquo;t seem quite confident about this. Do you think that makes you a better person than my half-brother?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He asked with a sarcastic tone, but was half truthful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they&rsquo;re going to get rid of him anyway, he should have called their bluff more openly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, I was just a student a while ago, you know? I never imagined that I would be an emperor, confident or not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Humph, you&rsquo;re pathetic. You think you can walk with supremacy just like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, I&rsquo;m sorry. But I wasn&rsquo;t really planning on supremacy, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">But&hellip;Huh? Isn&rsquo;t that a strange thing to say? I hadn&rsquo;t noticed from the reactions of Minits and Calgurio, but this doesn&rsquo;t seem to be consistent with the information my subordinates have been finding out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra&rsquo;s own intelligence services had reported that the new Emperor was a man of great strength. His popularity among the people was so great that even Demon Lord Rimuru, who had never given the Empire a second thought, looked up to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet the smiling boy in front of him didn&rsquo;t really fit his image.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">What&rsquo;s going on?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra couldn&rsquo;t help but look at him again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;to tell you the truth, I really want you to forgive me for the supremacy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A voice spilled out of Mithra&rsquo;s mouth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it wasn&rsquo;t just Mithra.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, Your Majesty! I asked you to be more dignified here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Whether or not we can get Mithra-dono on board here will have a great impact on the future course of the Empire&rsquo;s governance. For my sake and that of Minits, we need a companion to share our struggles with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minits and Calgurio were pleading with him at the same time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">It&rsquo;s too late now that I saw it in front of me. And now that I overheard the conversation, I don&rsquo;t want to be asked to join them&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be honest, he&rsquo;s getting the feeling that he&rsquo;d absolutely hate it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, he also thinks it&rsquo;s better to just survive than to be disposed of like this. Mithra wasn&rsquo;t stupid, so he knew perfectly well that he had no initiative left.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You fools. Uou haven&rsquo;t forgotten your promise not to coerce Masayuki, have you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;No, no, Velgrynd-san!? It&rsquo;s okay</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m fine!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Masayuki-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your Majesty!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Masayuki hurriedly hushes a slightly grumpy Velgrynd. Seeing this, Minits and Calgurio are impressed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh my, Masayuki. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it for a while now, but I wish you&rsquo;d call me by my nickname, Gryn, or whatever you want to call me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, yes. Um, so, Gryn-san, then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ufufu, that&rsquo;s nice to hear, Masayuki. Unlike Rudra, you&rsquo;re a straight-shooter. If you don&rsquo;t mind Calgurio and the others, it&rsquo;s none of my business. Good for you, both of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, thank you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s gratitude, I will remember it for the rest of my life!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd&rsquo;s mood seemed to have improved and he was relieved.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Watching the whole process, Mithra realized from the bottom of his heart that he was in trouble.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">I see. I suppose the only reason they want to involve me is not just to stabilize the situation. They really want to have a friend to help diffuse the anger from Velgrynd-sama. But then again, what about that boy, Masayuki?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra wondered if he was the same as him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Mithra wasn&rsquo;t the only one who felt that way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By the way, it was Mithra-san, correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recognize you, but it seems you&rsquo;re the Emperor. You can call me whatever you like.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll take you up on your offer. What do you think of me, Mithra-san? I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe I just seem like a normal young man to you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you mean? You&rsquo;re the Emperor. There&rsquo;s nothing normal about you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about, I just want you to calm down and give me an honest answer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, what are you talking about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra couldn&rsquo;t understand what Masayuki was trying to say.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the outcome of this response would determine Mithra&rsquo;s fate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mithra-san thinks I&rsquo;m mediocre, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you mean to imply that I am disrespectful? Then I must confess that you are nowhere near as good as my older brother. Emperor, you don&rsquo;t seem capable of rising above the rest of us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;If I say this, I&rsquo;ll be ruined.&rsquo; Mithra thought so, but he was in a desperate mood.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he was going to be done in by the hands of Velgrynd anyway, he wanted not to suffer. He thought that even Velgrynd, who was driven by passion, would fulfill such a wish.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the response he got was much more than that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t from Velgrynd, but from Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mithra-san! You&rsquo;re awesome! I needed someone like you!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t know what he meant, but when he asked him, Masayuki responded passionately.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know, because of my authority, other people always think I&rsquo;m this great guy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Masayuki shouts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one else could imagine how much trouble he had suffered because of the Unique Skill &lsquo;Chosen One&rsquo; he acquired.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now, the unique skill had evolved into the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;King of Heroes&rsquo;. The power was tremendous, and even though anyone could understand that it was a bad idea to leave politics to amateurs, he had been treated as an exception.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What, you mean&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so happy to have someone like Mithra-san who understands the real me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wet droplets spill out of Mithra&rsquo;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Masayuki-kun</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c6">no</span><span class="c9">, </span><span class="c0">Your Majesty!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Masayuki&rsquo;s hardships were no stranger to the world. But Mithra could understand them as if they were his own.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is not all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he was the one who understood Masayuki, he felt that the opposite was also possible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, now that you understand me, you don&rsquo;t have to call me Your Majesty!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. I understand, I understand. I&rsquo;ve had the same kind of pain in my heart.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want you to listen. At the worst time, a person was arrested just because I had whispered, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in trouble.&rsquo; Honestly, I almost thought to stop opening my mouth at all. It was impossible, but it was hard not to be able to speak my mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I understand! In my case, even when I speak my mind, it doesn&rsquo;t come through. It&rsquo;s interpreted by others, and my reputation just goes up. Seriously, give me a break! And the next thing I knew I was an Emperor, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s scary too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right! I&rsquo;m really scared. My buddy Jinrai-san was horrible at the beginning. He is understanding now, but he used to fight with Rimuru-san all the time! I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I wish he&rsquo;d stop mentioning my name&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can understand that. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t bring a chaperone with me this time. I was afraid of what they might say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Negotiations broke down over one person&rsquo;s comments as if it was a common story in the past. Only this time, he couldn&rsquo;t afford to make such a mistake.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a common story. No, well, I thought it was just me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, it&rsquo;s been hard on both of us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no laughing matter, seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Masayuki and Mithra talked with each other, forgetting about everyone else&rsquo;s existence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They had smiles on their faces.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And before long, a friendship had blossomed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;Yes, I was immunized by my mother because she had Rudra in her body. I&rsquo;ve been alive for a long time but I&rsquo;ve never seen this happen before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Velgrynd was surprised.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But for now, to celebrate their friendship, they watched in silence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that Masayuki and Mithra had become good friends, all the problems were cleared up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, Mithra agreed to help.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, instead of being directly involved in politics, he decided to bundle up the aristocrats of his family and support them from behind the scenes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has a true desire to spend more time on his own, but he decided after a discussion that this would be more convenient for him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will keep things the way they are and unite those noblemen who are unhappy with the current situation. However, I&rsquo;ll also try to persuade the more capable ones to cooperate with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you. We are seriously short on staff.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It would be better for the military as well. A poor rebellion would only lead to a loss of personnel. If Mithra-dono is willing to work with us, we can take the rebels in over time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, the situation was wrapped up nicely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The meeting had ended and the venue was dismissed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;One moment, please.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Testarossa spoke to Mithra as he stood up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mithra-dono, can you give me a moment of your time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra was shocked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He remembered exactly what he had said to Testarossa. He was relieved that the situation had been cleared, but maybe he had been naive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He sat back in the chair, trying hard not to let his voice tremble.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s just something I was wondering about earlier, so I had to do some digging. You have a hidden Skill, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;What? I&rsquo;m just a guy who</span><span class="c9">&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithra tried to deny it, thinking that the cloud had shifted, but he was interrupted by Testarossa. Interrupting him, Testarossa continued to speak.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.

I committed an irrevocable sin against you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At a loss for words, tears fell from Mamiya&rsquo;s eyes. She had acted stoutly, but her words reminded her of her crimes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I remember.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could I have forgotten the most important things and resented Mamiya&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My father-in-law, who had been a baron, was a fine man and my esteemed master.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What a fool I had been, even though he entrusted me with his precious daughter&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not guilty of anything.

When they evolve into greater demons, they are characterized by their nature and personality, and the colors of their lineage are clearly distinguishable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or, the higher-ups could scout and form a faction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rather, this may be the mainstream thing to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mizari is so diligent that she manages her own faction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve even infiltrated human society and run several groups, such as the Apostles of Vert.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Me?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m, well, I guess I&rsquo;ll pass on that hassle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hey, stop messing around.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m the same as Black?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are you kidding me?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have my own faction!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Black pisses me off, so don&rsquo;t ever think anything stupid again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Damn it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back to the subject at hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, newborn demons don&rsquo;t have factions, but by the time they evolve into greater demons, they&rsquo;re color-coded to belong to a faction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of them are born with colors, but they are often reincarnated demons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since demons are immortal, they will reincarnate even if they die.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even those relatives will disappear if their cores are shattered. However, demons are stubborn and can resurrect after their souls are shattered. Especially those close to the primary colors.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to beat one, then you&rsquo;d have to crush the core.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incidentally, with newborn servant types of weak willpower, you won&rsquo;t need to be so careful. Those are small fry that has only knowledge of battle but no experience, so it might die just by destroying the body. Well, there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And well, here&rsquo;s our secret.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since we figured this out, I feel like our defeat was also meaningful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rather, if anything, we did a good job.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, in the spirit of self-sacrifice, we serve Guy-sama, and it&rsquo;s a lot more fun than it seems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy-sama seems to have decided to leave the struggle for supremacy in the underworld and work on earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy-sama is apparently a very disciplined man, so we were with him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can do what you want with your life, too,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I don&rsquo;t care about that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I want to be on the winning side all the time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy-sama can&rsquo;t be defeated, so I think the position I&rsquo;m in is the best.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, if Guy-sama loses, that&rsquo;s interesting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, at that time, I said,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No. My mission is to be of service to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What do you think?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s almost like a perfect maid, don&rsquo;t you think?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You won&rsquo;t find a maid as loyal me anywhere else&mdash;at least I thought so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You are the king. We are your subjects. That is the eternal and immortal truth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mizari&hellip;You act so good!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s probably from the heart, so it&rsquo;s a bad idea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I guess my rivals are not so easy to deal with.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Mizari seems to trust me, so I&rsquo;ve stopped showing her things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh well, what can I do?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So the rotten relationship between Mizari and I continues.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We wandered from place to place and settled in our current base.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s the most frigid place a creature could ever live in, but I&rsquo;m a demon, so I don&rsquo;t mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s a lie.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I was trying to wash my clothes, they just froze.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I poked them in anger, they just fell to pieces.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got pissed off.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, I made that mistake, but I&rsquo;m fine.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You ought to be more careful about what you do!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rain, I think I should be a little concerned about that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy-sama warned me about this, so I&rsquo;m starting to care a little bit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s where the servants comes in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My subordinates make it easy on me!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I haven&rsquo;t failed once since then.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have grown up too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our job is not only washing clothes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are so good that people say we are all-around versatile maids.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We also do laundry, singing, dancing, playing musical instruments, and fine arts to meet Guy-sama&rsquo;s needs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, there have been some failures in cooking and laundry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we all learn from our mistakes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s the same with demons, so let&rsquo;s forget about the past.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My specialty, frankly, is painting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I love abstract painting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other day I painted Mizari as a model and she was moved to tears.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was furious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then it was a great success!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You really are&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mizari was stunned, but I didn&rsquo;t care.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her rage means that her emotions were in turmoil.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s a big deal to a demon, a spiritual life form.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was scared of my talent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Needless to say, when I paint Guy-sama or Velzard-sama, I have to choose a concrete painting. It&rsquo;s always a big hit because they&rsquo;re so perfect.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You can draw if you put your mind to it. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m even more annoyed&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mizari said something, but as always, I&rsquo;ll just let it slide.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, let me tell you about one of my hobbies.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The extreme cold is so harsh and inhospitable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a snowstorm outside.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is all white.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With such a backdrop, the inside of the &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; is in everlasting summer mode.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We even changed the terrain to create a lake and a white sandy beach.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I lay out on beach chairs and let the caterers serve me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the best kind of entertainment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wonder how much energy is spent on my hobby.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t stop smiling just thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is also very popular with Guy-sama.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you think about these things, Rain is the best.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I admit it. I knew you were great, Rain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ufufu, Mizari also gave me a compliment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this rate, I will continue to utilize my hobbies in my work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh yeah, I have an important job not to forget.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Occasionally, I am a guide for the Walpurgis.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Walpurgis.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the early days, as the name suggests, the three members Demon Lords got together to enjoy a meal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy-sama and Milim-sama.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And also Ramiris-sama.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim-sama is the niece of Velzard-sama and her power is immense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a time when she lost control and went on a rampage, and it was beyond description.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We could have joined the battle because we would not die, but to do so would have destroyed the planet itself, so in the end, Mizari, Velzard-sama, and I were tasked with containing the aftermath of the battle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;re not going to do it again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Ramiris-sama hadn&rsquo;t helped us, we would have fallen before the battle was over.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that&#39;s why we love Ramiris-sama as well as Guy-sama.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, we respect Milim-sama, so we are very excited to have all three of them together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The definition of &ldquo;Walpurgis&rdquo; has changed over the years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The number of Demon Lords is on the rise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Keeping mankind from dying out. That is Guy-sama&rsquo;s job, but he&rsquo;s been recruiting more people to help him do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first person to become the fourth Demon Lord was Dagruel-sama.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Actually, he was the one who suffered the most when Guy-sama and Milim-sama fought. He also helped us prevent the earth from being affected.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, Dagruel-sama&rsquo;s dominion has turned into a barren land&hellip;well, that&rsquo;s not my problem, so it&rsquo;s fine.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s managed to live with magic, but it didn&rsquo;t stop the desert from expanding. It&rsquo;s all settled now, but it seems to have been harder back then.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I just said good luck and cheered from afar.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next Demon Lord was Ruminas-sama, the &ldquo;Queen of Nightmares&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is the only daughter of the vampire ancestor, and is very strong, but I think she should be the one to talk about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was supposed to be the ancestor of the god human beings born from Veldanava-sama.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldanava-sama sought a wise being to speak to him. With the birth of angels and demons, his need was satisfied.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">That&rsquo;s why he tried to bring civilization to earth, and it seems that the ancestor</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt44" id="ftnt_ref44">[44]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;was expected to play that role.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, it failed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were immortal and didn&rsquo;t need to produce any offspring. That&rsquo;s why they lost.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or, like us demons, the ancestors didn&rsquo;t have a gender. So it seems they had to wait for tens of thousands of years or more for a race to be born that could thrive on earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I heard it all before.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the ancestor didn&rsquo;t give up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It kept running these forbidden experiments to fulfill Veldanava-sama&rsquo;s expectations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That bastard loved to experiment more than the prosperity of his descendants.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whether that was a good thing or a bad thing is difficult for me to say, but I can tell you this,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was an annoying asshole!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know how many times humanity perished because of that idiot&rsquo;s experiments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it&rsquo;s also true that because of that idiot&rsquo;s experiments, true human beings (high humans) were born.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although the eternal god human beings could not be created, it contributed to the birth of mankind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You don&rsquo;t believe that, do you?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&rsquo;re right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t see it with my own eyes, so I don&rsquo;t believe it either.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I heard that the ancestor created two races by analyzing his own body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were the high humans and the vampires.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not the way they were supposed to be born, but it&rsquo;s just as well they were born.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the time Guy-sama was summoned to earth, the human race had already spread. The high humans built a huge nation, larger than the human beings today.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that both races had their strengths and weaknesses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although the high humans inherited strong magical power, their spirits had problems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As you can see from the stupidity of summoning Guy-sama, they thought that they were the best of the best.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s a saying in other worlds that &ldquo;Those who are arrogant have not been around long enough&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s exactly what happened. They were destroyed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as for the vampires, they had their own problems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But was that a good thing?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;re still alive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A strong body and powerful magic.

This is a strawberry short made with three kinds of cream, developed by Mr. Yoshida and Shuna-sama.

I can&rsquo;t miss this opportunity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because ever since we evolved into demon nobles, we haven&rsquo;t been able to gain any more strength.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our experience has made us stronger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about; I&rsquo;m talking about the existence itself that could not evolve.

He was a hard worker and trusted by his subordinates. He was a bit too hot-headed but there was no doubt he was an excellent boss.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I didn&rsquo;t like Kaijin for the life of me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t because he was a commoner.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kaijin&rsquo;s skills were already worthy of being called a master craftsman. That&rsquo;s why I was so jealous of him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kaijin had made a name for himself in his family&rsquo;s business and was successful in his research. I, on the other hand, was a man whose only vocation was research.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My family came from the Marquis family, and I was destined to become a minister.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could have served in the military and studied while my father was alive, but that was only allowed to be my hobby.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I resented that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had no political talent. I didn&rsquo;t have the coldness of my father or the charisma of King Gazel. But the servants of the marquis family are still very good and were ready for the world of politics without me having to do anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, there were multiple ministerial positions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">King Gazel and his elders set the tone for the state, so it didn&rsquo;t matter if I was there or not.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll never be able to help King Gazel no matter how hard I try. I was convinced at the time that I would never be recognized.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I rebelled against Kaijin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then I could serve the king as a blacksmith. I have only research, but it was unfair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, I didn&#39;t have time to do my research leisurely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My father fell ill. He was getting worse, and the day was fast approaching when I would become master of the Marquis house.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I didn&rsquo;t produce results soon, I would go unnoticed by King Gazel for the rest of my life. That was the one thing I couldn&rsquo;t stand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I ignored Kaijin&rsquo;s insistence that I should proceed steadily with my research, and pushed the experiment forward.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a result, the keystone of the project, the spirit demon nucleus, went haywire, and the experiment ended in failure. And the project itself was also thrown out of existence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was stunned, but my family worked behind the scenes to make things happen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I knew it, Kaijin took the blame for everything and left the army.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And next thing I knew, I was working as a minister.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no way to apologize. I had led a life of boredom, living only to harass Kaijin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about that time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, I remembered and apologized to Kaijin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Kaijin looked at me with a puzzled expression on his face, wondering what I was talking about.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you talking about? Didn&rsquo;t Rimuru give you a budget for increased model production?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, the matter has already been approved. His Majesty managed to coerce Myourmiles-dono into giving him plenty of money for the project.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then, what&rsquo;s your apology for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s for a long time ago. Kicking you out of the troops and harassing you. Half the time it wasn&rsquo;t just me, but my subordinates who did my bidding. After all this time, I just remembered that I hadn&rsquo;t apologized yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really too late now. I mean, that&rsquo;s, like, you already apologized to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kaijin smiles at that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Certainly, I said I was sorry when I came to this country. That was undoubtedly my intention, but I still wanted to make another formal apology.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every day in this country was a series of amazing things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I know it&rsquo;s just an excuse, but I&rsquo;m going to say it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I dare say we were too busy to do anything about it!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">King Gazel is no different, but Rimuru&rsquo;s freewheeling behavior is even more so. He relies on someone like me for important tasks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first challenge was to educate the monsters. When he asked me to teach them to read and write and use the abacus, I wondered with disrespect if this guy was serious.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, the abacus is a very useful calculator that was also used by Dwargon. His Majesty Rimuru made a prototype and it was adopted without any problem because the usage was almost the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not just the basics that I teach.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a practical matter, I have also been entrusted with etiquette training for the monsters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Manners for monsters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What is this guy talking about? It&#39;s no wonder I thought that, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I asked Hist Majesty Rimuru what his purpose was, to which he replied with a smile,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I want to interact with humans in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought it sounded crazy, but I didn&rsquo;t have the right to refuse. So I nodded right then and there to say yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the job turned out to be more interesting than I thought.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The goblinas, led by Shuna-sama, were eager to learn the etiquette. The men were also not to be outdone, and were learning to be polite and courteous in order to lessen their vicious appearances.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The monsters were more inquisitive and motivated than expected, and I enjoyed teaching them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I enjoy teaching them even now.Eeven though we had agreed to continute untilthe research facility was set up, I still hold regular seminars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the meantime, a research facility was built in the place called the Sealed Cave.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had only the bare minimum of equipment, but I was still excited to know that I could work on my research again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was there that I met Gabil-dono the dragonewt, and became a good friend of like-minded people. His unconventional ideas were a great stimulus to my forgotten spirit of inquiry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was not sure what to expect when I was brought here, but now I have nothing but gratitude for King Gazel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can now say that I am happy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;That doesn&rsquo;t mean there are no problems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I came to Kaijin today to talk about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that I&rsquo;ve conveyed my apology I had been thinking about, I could get down to business.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, thank you for saying that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Now I think it&rsquo;s more important to get to the main point, don&rsquo;t you?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, was I that obvious to you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Attaboy. You&rsquo;ve always had a tendency to put off the awkward stuff and start talking about the most random of topics.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Come to think of it, that&rsquo;s true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I think about it, I&rsquo;ve known Kaijin for a long time now and we know each other well. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any reason to be shy about anything now, so I decided to get to the point.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To tell you the truth, I had some business to discuss with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A consultation? If the budget passed, isn&rsquo;t it an important case?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The budget is certainly important, but that&rsquo;s not this case.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is important. Much more important than the budget.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I never thought I&rsquo;d have to worry about something more important than the budget, but&hellip;okay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m sure Kaijin will have an answer for this challenge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;To tell you the truth, I was in His Majesty Rimuru&rsquo;s lab</span><span class="c9">&mdash;</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, wait a minute!

Isn&rsquo;t that something you shouldn&rsquo;t talk about lightly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not good.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I fully understand that without being told.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I can&rsquo;t just keep my mouth shut!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, hundreds of demons have been incarnated there!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of them were archdemons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were of the ruling class.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such a fearsome existance was incarnating right before my eyes.

Was it too wrapped up in an affectionate manner?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Asshole! It&rsquo;s not. Besides, you didn&rsquo;t wrap up any of your remarks!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s impossible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was still hiding important details.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha. That&rsquo;s okay, if you ask for specifics, even Kaijin-dono&rsquo;s will get a headache. So, please just tell me your honest opinion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kaijin has been rude, saying that I have a habit of escaping reality when I have a problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I&rsquo;ve got bigger things to worry about now, so I can&rsquo;t listen to such complaints.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, what do you think I should do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Should I keep it to myself or should I tell King Gazel as well?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meeting my question squarely, Kaijin scratches his head and gives his answer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Vesta, you&rsquo;re tired. Why don&rsquo;t you go home and have a drink and relax?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kaijin said and smiled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, this guy. He ran away&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not an answer to my question!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You idiot! Don&rsquo;t involve me in such a serious matter!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s a fair point, but I can&rsquo;t just retreat here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, I thought you&rsquo;d help me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, no, I&rsquo;m out of the country, you know? I&rsquo;m not in a position of responsibility like Vesta-san, the marquis of Dwargon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What rubbish. To me, Kaijin-dono is still a respected boss! More than a title, a position. I&#39;ve been saying that for a long time and obeyed your subordinates!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, you bastard! Is that why you apologized just now? You&rsquo;ve got a lot of nerve&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is how the battle between Kaijin and I continued for a while.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I want to get involved and Kaijin wants to get away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the victory or defeat is already visible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kaijin has a strong sense of responsibility&hellip;he would never run away irresponsibly after hearing all this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay. Tell me the details.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was hoping you&rsquo;d say that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as I had expected, Kaijin finally agreed to consult with me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was satisfied with that and smiled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We moved to a high-class tavern in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking for a dwarf, I&rsquo;m a drinker.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though I look more like an elf than a dwarf, I still love to drink.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we have a great selection of booze in this country. Moreover, the employees are under a strict obligation of confidentiality and will not give out any secret information if they overhear you talking about something secret.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a place where such security is guaranteed. It was the perfect place to talk about secrets.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, what do you want to do about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kaijin asks, so I&rsquo;m going to speak my mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If I keep silent, we&rsquo;ll have problems if something goes wrong. As long as I&rsquo;m not being kept quiet, I think I have an obligation to report it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing my response, Kaijin nodded with a huff.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, yeah. As we agreed from the beginning, that wouldn&rsquo;t be considered an announcement. Besides, you&rsquo;re still officially the marquis of Dwargon, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;d almost forgotten the fact that my title has not been erased from my country, nor has it been returned by me. In fact, I was stunned at my family home when before I knew it, King Gazel had kidnapped me and delivered me to His Majesty Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that time, I had no time to worry about my position in my homeland.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dwargon&rsquo;s nobles owned no lands of their own. All the land belonged to the Dwarf King and was administered by the nobility in the form of leases.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, compared to other nations, the concept of territory is different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are only three major cities in Dwargon: the center, east and west. The rest is made up of manor houses at the foot of the mountains and tunnel dwellings in natural caves.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The manor houses were divided into sections and administered by the nobility.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s what Rimuru calls housekeeping. A nobleman was expected to take care of the inhabitants of his territory and collect taxes from them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Depending on the rank, the number of family registers was different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m a marquis, so I actually have a good income.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I disappointed King Gazel after all my blunders, so I thought the title would be taken away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even to this day, I have been treated as a marquis.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, there&rsquo;s a normal amount of tax revenue each year. The good family orders that have supported me since the last generation have taken care of all the troublesome things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The salaries are paid normally, and since I was not expelled from my home country, I am able to return to my home and live normally.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I don&rsquo;t want to do that, and I have no plans to do so.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, this life is more interesting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there are servants who came after me, living in greater luxury than when I was at Dwargon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The food is delicious and the drinks are excellent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can research as much as I want, and this life is like a paradise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Myourmiles-dono&rsquo;s purse is a bit tight-lipped, but I digress.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. Well, I suppose, from the standpoint of a Marquis, I can&rsquo;t just betray King Gazel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think keeping quiet is a betrayal, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s your duty to report it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s right&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I understand that even if he doesn&rsquo;t tell me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the question is how to report it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So then, how to say it straight? We&rsquo;re growing a force that can take down the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, hey, I&rsquo;ve had too much to drink, but are you sure it&rsquo;s really that big of a deal?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mmm, this sake tastes great.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no stopping it, it&rsquo;s mellow on the palate. It&rsquo;s crisp and fragrant, with a rich flavor that seems to lift me out of my funk.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it does.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know Miss Ultima and Carrera-chan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, oh? I don&rsquo;t mean to be blunt, but are you drunk? Don&rsquo;t change the subject so fast.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t changed the subject, and I can&rsquo;t say this stuff unless I get drunk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, come on, then maybe&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. In fact, those girls are part of that force, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. Now that you mention it, it&rsquo;s no wonder the police are so strong in cracking down on the adventurers. I didn&rsquo;t see the faces of the security force, so I figured they must have been a secret unit that was trained somewhere&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that Kaijin has realized the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here in Tempest, no one goes wild against the police. Also, no one has appealed the ruling in court.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s because they were cracking down on criminals with an unparalleled force.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By all accounts, their fighting ability was so great that it was clear to everyone. By an adventurer&rsquo;s standards, even a lowly police officer could be considered over rank A.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? Ehhh? A police force that has the strength to fight the world?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mm. It&rsquo;s the perfect camouflage, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, even if you ask me that, what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A confused look appears on Kaijin&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can understand why he&rsquo;s puzzled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A demon that could destroy the world is now a police officer (hero) protecting its citizens.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And if I report it to King Gazel&hellip;How do you think he&rsquo;d react?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, yeah. Well&hellip; that&rsquo;s&hellip;that&rsquo;s a tough one to report.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right? I&rsquo;m absolutely not going to be believed. On the contrary, he&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m mad and disgraceful. King Gazel would believe me, but I&rsquo;m sure the stone-heads in charge would doubt my words.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kaijin muttered and gulped down the cup of sake.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You got me into this,&rdquo; he said, his eyes complaining to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I grinned and asked,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you think I should do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&hellip;I guess&hellip;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea to report it honestly. This one bothers me too&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then there was silence for a while.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The cup is empty and new wine is poured into it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kaijin and I wracked our brains, wondering what the right thing to do was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Dino-sama, who came to get me, who saved us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, hey, Vesta-san! We&rsquo;re the only ones cheating. Call me over. And buy me a drink. And then I&rsquo;ll give you a drink, all right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dino-sama said with a very nice smile.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing that smile, I asked him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, what do you think I should do, Dino-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was drunk.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I had forgotten.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This man is one of the demon lords.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just throw it. Let&rsquo;s throw the blame on somebody else!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dino-sama gave me a thumbs-up and assured me that if that was going to make me upset, it was just bad luck.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, that&rsquo;s not&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kaijin was about to say something to him, as if he were in trouble.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s fine! To be honest, I&rsquo;ve been asked to report everything, but I just skipped it all. And then he got really pissed off, so I thought I&rsquo;d do it right the next time. But who I report to is up to me, right? I just make sure to report it to the right person, and that is the right call. He&rsquo;s the one who gets pissed off, and I can be proud of the work I&rsquo;m doing. It&rsquo;ll give me a clean slate to go about my day, I recommend it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After saying that, Dino-sama ordered a drink of his own accord and began to drink it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apparently, that&rsquo;s the end of the consultation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it goes without saying that I would be the one to pay for that expensive drink.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Huh, I feel like an idiot for worrying about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;m going to adopt that strategy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, Vesta!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s what Vesta-san is all about. You&rsquo;re my boss after all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s strange to hear that from Dino-sama, a Demon Lord, and it makes me feel a little proud.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re definitely drunk. He&rsquo;s the wrong person to be taking such advice from. Think again!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kaijin&rsquo;s ranting and raving sounds comforting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drink! Today it&rsquo;s my treat. We&rsquo;ll drink as much as we want!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, come on, you don&rsquo;t want to be doing this, do you? You know how much they pay for this place, even the executivese.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s not nitpick the details, okay? Let&rsquo;s shut up, old man, and be goofy here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You just want to drink!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, but, I mean, what&rsquo;s the problem?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, no problem! Kaijin-dono, let&rsquo;s celebrate.
