The lizardmen who were members of the Blue Numbers also seemed to be receiving gifts. All three thousand of them had evolved into dragonewts. The ‘</span><span data-term="Hiryuu" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ had successfully broken through the barrier of A rank, and had gained enough fighting ability to be called mid-level </span><span data-term="majin" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.

It covered the body with self-repairing armor, taking in the surrounding magicules. In principle, it was the same as ‘body armor’, but its defense was incomparably higher.

Those of this group were humanoid dragonewts. Since they were still in human form, their defense was inferior. However, their speed and attack power had been greatly increased.

I was surprised too.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_672"><span class="indent"><span>In effect, Kumara had received an equivalent of nine names from me. As a result, the bond between the eight and Kumara had been strengthened. And even the power that the tailed beasts had grown by absorbing the dense magicules of the labyrinth had been returned to the main body Kumara to give her strength overall. Well, there was no point in worrying about what has already been done. Kumara might have been defeated without it, so I will say that the result was overall good.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_673"><span class="indent"><span>I awarded Kumara the souls. As soon as I did so, she succeeded in evolving into a </span><span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. The eight beasts of Kumara’s body shined and returned to her main body with a glow. Kumara then grew nine tails. One of the tails, which had originally remained, turned golden. The remaining eight tails became a shimmering silvery white. They were tails with very beautiful fur. But even more beautiful than that was Kumara herself.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_674"><span class="indent"><span>Kumara’s body turned out so voluptuous and seductive that she was completely unimaginable from her infantile appearance. She appeared to be even more attractive than before. Her long hair changed from brown to golden, like ears of rice reflecting the light, and it ran down her back, silky and shiny. Was it beauty that underwent evolution?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_675"><span class="indent"><span>No, of course, the amount of magicules had increased. At this stage, she had already surpassed the awakened </span><span data-term="Gabil" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. I never expected her to reach this level. Kumara herself had a great deal of fighting power, but it was only when all the eight beasts were combined into a composite beast form (chimera mode) that she could display her most powerful ability. Conversely, Kumara becoming more powerful meant that the Eight Beasts would follow suit and also become more powerful. What’s more, their souls were connected through my ‘Naming’, and a gift was given only to those eight…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_676"><span class="indent"><span>And the most foul point was that the power given to them would be returned to Kumara, making her even stronger. In a sense, this was a monopoly of power. From Kumara, I sensed a sly, calculating nature that I could not have imagined based on her beautiful appearance. It was no wonder that Kumara did not get along with an honest and direct person like Apito. Still, there was no reason why such a drastic evolution should have to be such a burden on Kumara. Kumara seemed to be doing her best just to stay conscious. If she kept forcing herself like this, she may lose control, so this had to be stopped.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_677"><span class="indent"><span>“Go back and get some rest.” I ordered gently.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_678"><span class="indent"><span>Kumara looked a little disappointed, but she obeyed my order honestly. Most likely, she would sleep like Ranga and get used to her increased strength. In any case, I was looking forward to seeing her growth. No, even now, she is already a great beauty at this stage of her life. Anyway, Kumara left and returned to her own guardian realm.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_679"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_680"><span class="indent"></span></p><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I thought of putting off Zegion’s reward because he was the strongest, but I felt that it would be unnecessary to worry about it. After all, just by looking at his calmness told me that he would have nothing to do, losing control. As expected, he was the most powerful being in the labyrinth. </span><span data-term="Wisdom King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span data-term="Raphael" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san also recognized his exceptional fighting sense, and his magicule count was as high as </span><span data-term="Benimaru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s. After taking Veldora as a teacher, he had even mastered the dubious fighting techniques of manga. No wonder he was so strong. In this war as well, he alone had defeated the strongest of the Imperial Army whom the other ‘</span><span data-term="Elite Ten" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ members would have had a difficult time against.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_703"><span class="indent"><span>They would be fools if they lost the battle against them at the same time. Zegion, however, was able to beat them with a crushing defeat, without letting them get away with it. He proved that he was a very powerful fighter. Although it was speculation, Zegion was probably stronger than any normal </span><span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> now. Even I, an awakened ‘True </span><span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’, might lose to him if I let my guard down. But to awaken such a Zegion…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_704"><span class="indent"><span>I had heard that even </span><span data-term="Diablo" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and his colleagues couldn’t beat him, so I was really getting worried. However, that was then and this is now. There were already several awakened </span><span data-term="demon" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> lords in the making, so it was too late to worry about this now. I had already given souls to five of them, and the evolution ritual was still underway. As proof, I had been feeling an influx of power. The Harvest Festival of those who had fallen asleep was being returned to me through the ‘Food Chain’. It was a lot of power, but my body was taking it in without any problem as if it were a tank short on fuel.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_705"><span class="indent"><span>It shouldn’t be a problem. Momentum was the key for this kind of thing, and I would just go with it. Don’t be afraid and keep moving forward! That’s basically how I felt. Thinking about things the other way around. How strong would Zegion become? Thinking of it that way, I felt excited. There was a possibility that Zegion would surpass me, but as long as the ‘Food Chain’ was there, my advantage would not be reversed. Believing this, I resumed the ritual without worrying about it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_706"><span class="indent"><span>“You’re really something. To be honest, I didn’t expect you to be this strong.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_707"><span class="indent"><span>“It is all thanks to </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-sama and his guidance!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_708"><span class="indent"><span>No, it was Veldora who taught you, wasn’t it—wait? </span><span data-term="Wisdom King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span data-term="Raphael" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san had been sneaking around behind my back, too. Then perhaps he thought that was me. It would be too much trouble to correct him, so I decided to just leave it at that.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_709"><span class="indent"><span>“No need to be modest. It’s only due to your untiring efforts. Please continue to hone your strength for me. And from this day forward, I will allow you to call yourself the ‘Mist Lord’.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_710"><span class="indent"><span>“Yes, I was moved with awe!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_711"><span class="indent"><span>Zegion was as taciturn as ever, but he was inspired and motivated by my words. What might have sounded like random words to me, must have sounded like gospel to Zegion. I guess he had more of a worship filter than I expected, but it’s not too bad to be admired at this level, is it? I originally thought that I would just be protecting a rare insect, but as it turned out, I was now the one being protected. Zegion’s growth was not something I deliberately cultivated, but was rather due to his talent. In addition to that, there was the dense magic leaking out of Veldora and the training environment in which one can come back to life even after death. Also, there was a training partner who was so much better than Zegion. One could not ask for more.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_712"><span class="indent"><span>Well, the reasons were still trivial. He got stronger as a result, that’s all that mattered. I gave Zegion the souls. Zegion trembled for a moment, but he managed to control the flood of power with his will alone. Unlike </span><span data-term="Gabil" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s case, he was enduring it with sheer perseverance. Seeing him do that made me feel a bit gutless for falling asleep so easily. I didn’t think that was something that could be done with just spirit or guts, but I couldn’t deny it now after seeing the real example in front of my eyes. Zegion evolved into an extremely terrifying being. According to his will, a part of his outer shell was transformed into hihiirokane. In addition to being coupled with various laws, Zegion’s exoskeleton was comparable to a </span><span data-term="mythical-grade" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> hardness.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_713"><span class="indent"><span>This meant that his body itself was a weapon. In terms of combat ability alone, Zegion was unquestionably the strongest. Although for spiritual life forms, strength in combat did not affect their superiority…but even so, they were sure to be a threat. Even now, while Zegion was still in the process of evolution, he seemed to be acquiring various other abilities. It would be exciting to see how he gradually evolved later on. Despite Zegion’s suppression by force of will, the Harvest Festival was definitely still taking place. And as expected, Apito appeared to be the only target of a gift.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_714"><span class="indent"><span>Zegion and Apito were the only ones I had helped by giving them my own cells. That is why Apito was the only blood relative for Zegion. Although there were other dangerous species in the hierarchy of bugs, they were nearly wiped out in this defense battle. They would not be resurrected, but would have to wait for natural emergence. The rest were Apito’s dependents, but all of them had been killed. The souls of these bugs were given to Apito just now. I wondered what she was going to do with them, but it seemed as if she was going to use them for her own enhancement. The result of her evolution would prove it. During the celebration, Apito also did not look distressed in front of me. She remained calm and endured with the dignity of a queen. Like Zegion, I was impressed by her performance. With admiration for the both of them, I told them to return to their places.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_715"><span class="indent"><span>………</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_716"><span class="indent"><span>……</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_717"><span class="indent"><span>…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_718"><span class="indent"><span>As soon as the celebration was over, Zegion and Apito returned to their home in the labyrinth and became cocoons. With that, they would smoothly complete their evolution. Apito consumed the gift from Zegion along with the souls of her dependents and subordinate bugs. Through that she received an enormous amount of energy in her body. As a result, her flesh collapsed, and she was reborn with a stronger and more battle-ready body.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_719"><span class="indent"><span>Apito was reborn, and with the Unique Skill ‘</span><span data-term="Queen Worship" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ that she had acquired, she managed to create as many as nine insect-type majins, each with the characteristics of multiple types of bugs. The Unique Skill ‘</span><span data-term="Queen Worship" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ was the ability to take in the ecology of the bugs she had eaten and produce them as </span><span data-term="majin" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. In the future, a swarming community of </span><span data-term="majin" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> would be formed on this floor. Apito would reign as the true queen. Apito was both a member of the ‘</span><span data-term="Elite Ten" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ and a follower of Zegion. Therefore, Zegion would not be shy about pouring favor upon Apito. Thus, it was understandable that Apito evolved abnormally.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_720"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_721"><span class="indent"><span>Even if Apito, the recipient of the gift, had evolved to such a great extent, Zegion was no exception. Although his physical strength had evolved, the amount of magicules in his body surpassed that of an awakened Clayman. However, there was one Skill acquired by evolution that was even more problematic. While Apito’s ‘</span><span data-term="Queen Worship" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ skill was an amazing power in its own right, and also possessed such a broken performance that it could be compared to the great sin skills, Zegion’s power was completely different. He had acquired the Ultimate Skill ‘</span><span data-term="Illusion King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> Mephisto’—a true ultimate power. As a disciple of Veldora, he had obtained a Skill that was truly worthy of him. With this power, Zegion was the undisputed king of the labyrinth. A paradise of bugs created by Apito. As king and queen, Zegion and Apito would establish their absolute position.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_722"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_723"><span class="indent"></span></p><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

That was merely a reproduction of memories, but if they developed and continued to think with their souls and astral bodies, they would be released from their lifespans and be called mental organisms. In this case, almost all physical attacks would not cause any fatal injuries, and even if they lost their bodies, they would be able to regenerate.

Naming the dragon lords was my own idea, but the soul connection would be formed with Ramiris. I was relieved to see that this was also a success.

So how was their evolution?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1091"><span class="indent"><span>As expected, the dragon lords really could change into human-like forms.

Such a form was only a type of state change. They did not become dragonoids like Milim, but remained as dragon lords like before. In the end, a dragonoid is a spiritual being with a physical body, like an irregular form of a ‘True Dragon’. Even if a dragon lord possesses strong power, as long as it is trapped in their own body, their power would be far from that of a ‘True Dragon’, which was a perfect spiritual life form. Although there was no change in the race, evolution had succeeded without any problem. Moreover, they seemed to have succeeded in acquiring a more powerful mana than expected.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1097"><span class="indent"><span>Their total magicule counts were several times larger than before the evolution, and they appeared to have reached the level of an awakened Clayman.

I shuddered to think what would have happened if I had consumed my own magicules, when ‘Naming’ alone showed such an increased rate. If I had not done what I did, I might have suffered irreparable damage. ‘Naming’ was a terrible system, after all. I had used more than 5,000 souls, and I was reminded once again that </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> were not logical beings. But, well, it’s only a loss if you care about it. Thus, the evolution of the dragon lords, which also served as a thank-you to Ramiris, was successfully completed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1098"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1099"><span class="indent"><span>By the way, ‘</span><span data-term="Dungeon’s Elite Ten" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ were almost equal in terms of the amount of magicules. However, in terms of the unquantifiable fighting power, there appeared to be a big gap between them. Zegion was the leader, that went without saying. Compared to the other ‘</span><span data-term="Elite Ten" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’, the evolved dragon lords were still weaker.

They also possessed various kinds of magic. All of these alone were undoubtedly a mighty and powerful force. However, that could not be used against those who were skilled in battle of the same rank. It is because of their lack of combat experience that they were fundamentally low in skill-level.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1100"><span class="indent"><span>The dragon lords must have been defeated many times in this defensive battle, and must have felt very frustrated. As soon as they evolved and became able to speak human language fluently, they asked for more training. By transforming into humanoid form, the dragon lords were able to learn the skills of human combat. Then they realized that a refined art was stronger than the conventional fighting style of </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. Instead of relying on physical attacks with their breath, claws, and fangs, they used magic and incorporated it into their fighting. Then, they learned how to fight as a human being and tried to incorporate it into actual combat. It was a remarkable development for them to come to this conclusion by their own thinking. The training offer was accepted.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1101"><span class="indent"><span>“Kuahahaha! Leave it to me!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1102"><span class="indent"><span>Veldora, who was in a good mood after raising Zegion, agreed to train the dragon lords.

However, we were in the middle of a very important discussion, so hopefully they would read the atmosphere. Besides, that was a war strategizing room, not a playroom.

But right now I can’t complain because I was the cause. I had said the other day that we’d have fun after the war. Since then, the two of them had been discussing where to go.

Perhaps it was because they had a longing to travel, but they were even more enthusiastic about this than I was. And so, using my physical magic ‘</span><span data-term="Argus" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’, the two of them had made it a daily routine to enjoy the scenery of the world in their spare time.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1882"><span class="indent"><span>The low-cost surveillance magic could be kept active all the time.

She was prepared to completely ignore the part where Veldora said he had some work to do. Veldora looked at me as if asking for help.

I will not forget your bravery! Veldora looked sad, knowing that he could no longer count on my help. But his hands moved quickly, grabbing Ramiris swiftly with a firm grip.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1901"><span class="indent"><span>“H-Hey, wait, Master! I have nothing to do with this!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1902"><span class="indent"><span>“Please! Don’t leave me alone!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1903"><span class="indent"><span>The sight of his pitiful appearance convinced me—Veldora and his sister must not get along well. Rather than not getting along, it seemed more like fear…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1904"><span class="indent"><span>Speaking of having trouble getting along with sisters, the same was true of my friend from my previous life.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1905"><span class="italic indent"><span>‘She’s a tyrant…’ </span></span><span class="indent"><span>He used to complain like that with an enlightened look in his eyes.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1906"><span class="indent"><span>I guess even a ‘True Dragon’ could have similarities to a human. Incidentally, he had been engaged in a fierce match over who was more unfortunate compared to those who were not fond of their younger siblings, but that’s none of my business as I only had an older brother. I guess they were both on the same side. Veldora gave off the same feeling as them. This suddenly reminded me of something. I had been having a casual conversation with Veldora at that time. We were arguing about where to travel, and Veldora was stubbornly against the idea of going to the north.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1907"><span class="indent"><span>He had made some excuse about how it was cold there, but I knew that was unnatural for someone who did not even feel the cold. Now I wondered if that was because he knew Velzard-san was there. As I looked at Veldora, who was gripping the door with a deathly look on his face and desperately begging not to go, I began to feel more and more sorry for him. Although I was planning to abandon him because I didn’t want to get caught in the crossfire, I decided to help him a little. But if that didn’t work, I would just give up and leave things be.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1908"><span class="indent"><span>“</span><span data-term="Guy" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, you guys live further north than the Kingdom of </span><span data-term="Ingracia" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, don’t you?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1909"><span class="indent"><span>“Hmm?

It is surprising that Veldora, who is confident and fearless of the world, would have something he cannot cope with.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1916"><span class="indent"><span>“Veldora is not very good at dealing with Velzard-san, is he?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1917"><span class="indent"><span>“D-don’t be silly!

After all, I’ve been taking good care of him.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1920"><span class="indent"><span>Velzard spoke with an impeccable smile.

When he was reborn and was still rampaging, I stopped his movements and made him quiet, then gave him a gentle sermon. He was a troubled child who couldn’t be humanized, so the damage he caused was too much. If I had not cleaned up the mess, things would have gotten even more out of control.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1922"><span class="indent"><span>Velzard spoke of many past deeds as if to say she had done a very good job. It was hard to listen to the story without tears. No doubt, this was because of that.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1923"><span class="indent"><span>“Veldora, you’ve been through a lot…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1924"><span class="indent"><span>“Do you understand, </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>? Do you finally understand me?!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1925"><span class="indent"><span>That’s right, no wonder he developed a sense of bitterness. It was just too bad that she didn’t intend to be malicious. If this misunderstanding, or rather Velzard’s assumption, was not cleared up, Veldora would be frightened for a very long time.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1926"><span class="indent"><span>Also, Veldora was Veldora. It would be impossible for him to resist Velzard with his overweening bravado. If this pretense of strength did not stop, the relationship would not develop well.

Well, that doesn’t matter.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1927"><span class="indent"><span>“Velzard-san, at the risk of sounding like an interloper, I have to say that Veldora is not very fond of you.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1928"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh, why?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1929"><span class="indent"><span>“In a phrase, it is because you’re overdoing it.

So, please, can we stop using violence and just say what we mean?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1930"><span class="indent"><span>I offered Velzard-san to stay the night if she wanted.

On the other hand, the other side of our relationship (the ‘back’) had to do with our darker deeds, in which we, the conspiracy trio, were in our element. It may sound less than savory, but the contents were indeed true. Just what were our darker deeds? It was our plan to take control of the newly born giant economic circle.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2034"><span class="indent"><span>………</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2035"><span class="indent"><span>……</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2036"><span class="indent"><span>…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2037"><span class="indent"><span>At first, the three of us had just been drinking buddies.

The reason why the military of each country could not handle them was because of the retaliation from the criminal organizations. In some cases, the local lords were even the head of the criminal organizations, and they were hesitant to reveal their crimes to the public. Of course, the crimes could not be allowed to go unchecked, but if they were pursued, civil war might break out. For fear of such a situation, the state could not interfere. There were many situations in which the state had no choice but to tolerate the crimes. I was troubled by this situation and complained to Elmesia-san, who frequently stayed at the hotel.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2043"><span class="indent"><span>“I wish you would consult me on something more pleasant.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2044"><span class="indent"><span>At first, Elmesia-san was reluctant to give me a detailed explanation, but as she listened to my words, her eyes gradually changed and she leaned forward to give me a detailed explanation. What I had stated, in other words, was beneficial not only to me but also to Elmesia-san. Or rather, I had been telling her such dream-like things, trying to get her interested in it. Economy and crime were inextricably linked. The gap between the rich and the poor, the widening of the gap would cause envy, and it may even affect the reign of the government. Criminal organizations would be fattened up as a receptacle for the poor, and this may be a cause of disturbance of the nation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2045"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Myourmiles-kun" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> used to be a don of such an underworld. He understood what I was explaining to him. The important thing was to prepare a place for the poor. It was important to provide a job that anyone could do, so that no matter how many people dropped out, they would not have to commit crimes. That was usually the military. There were a wide range of jobs in the military, and they were always looking for people to do them, but if the nation was poor, they were not able to do them. And so, we were going to support them from the shadows.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2046"><span class="indent"><span>“First, we create a criminal organization.

Since Elmesia-san was the largest shareholder, the moment Figaro betrayed me, it would mean the collapse of the entire trading company.

It was a bit much to be so business-minded, but the profits would be returned to me, so I should consider it as a necessary evil. I didn’t think it was right to say that everything should be regulated. Well, in this case, I had my own interests, so I thought so even more.

They were like natural enemies, and it would be difficult to win in a head-to-head match.

Velgrynd’s attribute was heat. In contrast, Velzard’s attribute was ice. In other words, they represented the opposing factors of ‘acceleration’ and ‘deceleration’. If the two were to fight seriously, the result would be disastrous. Neither side would survive and both sides would fall. In other words, there was a strong possibility that both of them would be wiped out. In that case, both would be reincarnated, but their current selves would be lost. While they would inherit memories, they would become different people.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2185"><span class="indent"><span>Velgrynd was afraid of this.

Velgrynd couldn’t help but laugh at herself for clinging obsessively to such a trivial emotion as love. A complete victory was the prerequisite for the safety of herself and </span><span data-term="Rudra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.

If this was the Veldora that Velgrynd knew, he would have already begun rampaging all around the world. However, he seemed to have become very close with the new </span><span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. When she heard that he had even joined the Walpurgis, she suspected that he had gone crazy after being sealed for so long. Still, she did not think that Veldora, who loved chaos, would remain silent before an army of a million. That is why she was sure he would come out, but the result was surprising. Even then, he had remained hidden in the depths of the labyrinth and did not show himself. This was unexpected for Velgrynd.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2188"><span class="italic indent"><span>That kid really does whatever he wants—but why didn’t he come out this time?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2189"><span class="indent"><span>As was the case on the last expedition, Veldora did not like to have his territory invaded.

Last time, the few who survived had succeeded in evolving.

The reason why he did not disclose the detailed information from the intelligence was to motivate the corps commanders by misleading them. From Velgrynd’s point of view, the confidence of the corps commanders was even comical. The chances of the plan working were slim. Or rather, it could even be said there wasn’t a chance at all. It was impossible to defeat Veldora with an army that had been reinforced by science. Therefore, there would be many deaths this time as well.

Everything had gone as the Empire wanted it to go. The secret society Cerberus was an organization led by the people Damrada had gathered.

A divine </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> spirit was a subordinate existence of the ‘True Dragon’ race. Like the ‘True Dragons’, they had various attributes, and fire was considered to be a major attribute. Attributes were the laws that governed the principles of this world, and there were eight kinds in total.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3008"><span class="indent"><span>There were the natural attributes of ‘earth’, ‘water’, ‘fire’, and ‘wind’ and the attribute of ‘space’. These were known as the five major attributes. It was said that fire was strong against earth, water was strong against fire, wind was strong against water, space was strong against wind, and earth was strong against space. The earth was consumed by fire, fire was extinguished by water, water was dissipated by wind, wind was isolated by space, and space was indexed only by the earth. In such a way, the five major attributes were in a conflicting relationship.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3009"><span class="indent"><span>In addition to these five attributes, there were two opposing attributes, ‘light’ and ‘darkness’, along with the attribute of ‘time’, which was not bound by anything and reigned over all attributes.

The important thing was that there were eight kinds of divine spirits, and they were higher than normal spirits.

I had been keeping my composure because I had thought I could call Veldora to even the game. Now, however, I realized that I could no longer say such a thing.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3534"><span class="indent"><span>According to </span><span data-term="Wisdom King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span data-term="Raphael" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san, ‘Parallel Existence’ was a very dangerous power. Thinking about it simply, it did not seem to be much different from the ‘Clone’ which </span><span data-term="Souei" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> was good at. In </span><span data-term="Souei" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s case, he could control multiple ‘Clones’ at the same time. The ‘Clones’ were indistinguishable from the main body, and it did not matter how many ‘Clones’ were destroyed, as long as the main body was safe.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3535"><span class="indent"><span>Another foul feature was that the ‘Clone’ could be split again and again as long as the ‘mana’ was not exhausted. After all, there was no difference in the physical ability between the main body and the ‘Clones’, so it was as if there were multiple </span><span data-term="Souei" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s. However, I would reveal something here.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3536"><span class="indent"><span>This ‘Clone’ was a tricky thing to control at the same time. It was not a splitting of the consciousness, but rather a ‘Telepathy Net’ that eliminated the time difference between the two. By adjusting the reaction through ‘</span><span data-term="Thought Acceleration" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’, it only looks like they are moving at the same time without any discomfort. The reason why I didn’t use ‘Clone’ so often was that it was a rather difficult trick. In other words, </span><span data-term="Souei" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> was a master of the art and had extraordinary senses. I, an amateur, could handle it so well.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3537"><span class="indent"><span>And there was one more thing. Although ‘Clones’ were equal in physical ability, mana was ontological. Therefore, there was a disadvantage in that they could not use all the skills one possessed. This was the reason why </span><span data-term="Souei" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s ‘Clones’ only used the skills with less mana. Therefore, by mastering this condition well, one can discern which one is the main body of the clone. The characteristic of this Skill was that it was not invincible, since the ‘Clone’ would disappear when the main body was defeated.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3538"><span class="indent"><span>However, the following was a very important point. Velgrynd’s use of ‘Parallel Existence’ allowed one to completely split one’s consciousness. It could be thought of as the simultaneous existence of multiple entities. In other words, this was a ‘Split Body’, and even if it was defeated, if any one of the ‘Split Bodies’ remained, they could then become the main body.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3539"><span class="indent"><span>Moreover, there was no need to split the mana. It was as if all ‘Split Bodies’ were connected to the main body, so they could replenish each other’s mana as much as they wanted. That said, since there was a limit to the maximum amount of mana, the total mana of the other ‘Split Bodies’ including the main body was also reduced by the mana divided. This may be the key to a strategy, but the opponent was a ‘True Dragon’, which was a race famous for their huge magicule counts. I should have realized that it would be meaningless to use up magicules halfheartedly, since the recovery rate was faster than the consumption rate. To be honest, I didn’t know how to beat them. Although I was not </span><span data-term="Testarossa" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, I was now being tempted to assert that ‘it’s impossible to win’. I looked back at Velgrynd and dared to smile arrogantly.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3540"><span class="indent"><span>“Well, thank you. I have a great partner. And when it comes to strategy, I won’t lose. So, it seems that you think you’re leading us into a trap, but can you tell us what you’re after?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3541"><span class="indent"><span>In times like these, bluffing was the only way to go. I would show them that I saw through their attempts, and proceed as usual. If I could make them upset and put them on their guard, it would be a win-win situation. However, it did not work out that way.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3542"><span class="indent"><span>“How arrogant.

I had been listening to it because I thought it was impossible, but if there was ‘Parallel Existence’, wouldn’t Velgrynd be heading for the labyrinth right now?

But more importantly…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3570"><span class="indent"><span>I took this opportunity to express my request. As far as I was concerned, no damage had been done, so I wasn’t going to ask for an apology. I was willing to let this invasion go as long as they promised not to bother us anymore. I know some people would complain about it, but I thought it would be best if this could be settled without any more bloodshed. I know I am naive, and I understand that promises are unreliable.

Veldora was on my mind. I didn’t think the invincible ‘</span><span data-term="Storm Dragon" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ could be defeated, but his opponent was also an unimaginable </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.

If that’s the case, I won’t have to torment my cute little brother.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3621"><span class="indent"><span>Velgrynd brought up another image. It showed a wounded Veldora fighting against her in dragon form</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3622"><span class="indent"><span>“I’ve been meaning to ask you, how did you manage to tame that one?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3623"><span class="indent"><span>“Huh?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3624"><span class="indent"><span>“I’m asking how you got Veldora to obey you.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3625"><span class="indent"><span>No, he doesn’t obey me.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3626"><span class="indent"><span>“Veldora and I are friends. That’s all.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3627"><span class="indent"><span>“So then you’re not going to tell me. That’s too bad.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3628"><span class="indent"><span>Velgrynd exhaled, looking genuinely disappointed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3629"><span class="indent"><span>“In that case, I’ll show no mercy. That boy, the only thing he has above me is the amount of magicules.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3630"><span class="indent"><span>As soon as she said that, Velgrynd disappeared. I was surprised and upset. I knew that </span><span data-term="Rudra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and the others were trying to buy time to defeat and tame Veldora. I understood that, and we were just going along with them because we were also trying to buy time. Velgrynd’s ‘Parallel Existence’ was nearly invincible, but it had its drawbacks. That was the depletion of energy. By eliminating them one by one, you could deplete the divided magicules. Since magicules do not recover immediately, it was possible to weaken the opponent in general.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3631"><span class="indent"><span>If the number of divided magicules was small, the user could not perform big moves. Therefore, I thought that Veldora would have an advantage. Judging from the video, Veldora did not seem to be able to defeat Velgrynd’s ‘Parallel Existence’ alone. On the contrary, through ‘Soul Corridor’, Veldora’s impatience could be felt. On the screen floating in the air, Velgrynd, who had been fighting against </span><span data-term="Testarossa" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and the others, disappeared.

I knew that this was a bad thing. Velgrynd’s power was beyond my expectation. She had seen through our intentions and used them in a mocking way…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3632"><span class="indent"><span>“Do you mind? Well, I’ll give you one more chance after this battle is over.

I felt sorry, but there was nothing I could do about it now. Now that Velgrynd was gone, perhaps it was time to take </span><span data-term="Rudra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> down, but for some reason I have a bad feeling about that.

No, that was no joke. Because it could only be described that way. Two dragons were fighting in a fierce battle.

It was more agile than Veldora, and its silhouette seemed to be suitable for flying in the sky. I wondered what kind of battle would be fought…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3643"><span class="indent"><span>Even though it was late at night, the sky was unusually bright. The Great Jura Forest was all ablaze, the curtain of night reflecting a hazy red. The capital ‘</span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ had been evacuated inside the labyrinth, so it was not damaged, but if it had been left outside, it would have been obliterated without a trace. As proof of this, the great gate connecting the labyrinth to the outside world was also destroyed. Most likely, the upper floors of the labyrinth were devastated. The battle had reached a stalemate.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3644"><span class="indent"><span>Velgrynd had to cancel the ‘Parallel Existence’. It was difficult to realize based on the devastation of the forest, but the forces of the two sides were actually well-controlled. Despite the fact that this was a clash of extreme energies, it was a very sophisticated battle. In terms of speed, the two were evenly matched. Veldora had also grown remarkably well, and his highly controlled powers enabled him to fly at very high speeds. He was holding his own against Velgrynd.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3645"><span class="indent"><span>It seemed that Veldora had been training secretly, and the results were evident. From what I could see, Veldora was slightly ahead of Velgrynd. If we compared only the total amount of magicules, Veldora was superior. The amount of power had increased since his time of being sealed, and he had also acquired some Skills. This was the reason for the result. Even so, I could not shake off my anxiety. Because Velgrynd still had the advantage when it came to mana control. Now that Velgrynd was concentrating on Veldora, the battle was just beginning.

Did he think that he had an overwhelming advantage even without relying on Velgrynd? But still, there was no reason to take that risk here. What made him so confident?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3649"><span class="indent"><span>This was also of interest to me, but I was also curious about how the battle between Veldora and the others was turning out. Velgrynd launched a flame attack, which Veldora blocked with his Barrier. Then, Veldora fired a storm attack in return, but Velgrynd avoided it. It was a tremendous battle. Even I shuddered as I watched it, as if it were a mythological battle. I had never seen Veldora fight seriously before, but it was more than I expected. I never thought that Veldora could go toe-to-toe with Velgrynd, who had overwhelmed </span><span data-term="Testarossa" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and the others. But it was also not too surprising when you thought about it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3650"><span class="indent"><span>Veldora had mastered his Ultimate Skill, ‘</span><span data-term="Investigation King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> Faust’. That is why he was able to compete with Velgrynd. In terms of skill-level, Velgrynd was superior. However, Veldora’s ‘</span><span data-term="Investigation King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> Faust’ was a cheat-level ability. </span><span data-term="Wisdom King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span data-term="Raphael" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san told me that his power was ‘</span><span data-term="Probability Manipulation" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’. He also had ‘</span><span data-term="Investigation of Truth" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’, which was the highest authority of the analysis system. With this, it was possible to recognize the enemy’s power immediately and to take appropriate measures.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3651"><span class="indent"><span>It was even a little confusing. What was the point of combat-specialization in that case? Truth be told, I was wondering who could beat Veldora who could use his ‘</span><span data-term="Investigation King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> Faust’. That is why I firmly believed in Veldora’s victory. Even now, an invisible attack had been unleashed on Velgrynd. It was impossible to discern from the images, but it looked as if Velgrynd had suddenly been damaged.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3652"><span class="indent"><span>But I knew. This was one of Veldora’s special moves, called ‘Storm Blast’. He had boasted about it a lot, but now that I actually saw it, I was impressed. At a glance, Veldora released multiple types of waves that seemed meaningless, and then made them intersect at expected coordinates. This was the point where the effect finally came into play. By the time one realized it, it would already be too late. After all, if you have already been hit, there is no way to avoid or defend against it. Well, he seems to have developed a crazy technique.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3653"><span class="indent"><span>Each wave seemed to have no meaning, which was why they were subconsciously ignored. If one didn’t know it, they would definitely be hit, and it was a deadly attack. Velgrynd was also hit by a direct attack of Storm Blast. Veldora was fighting masterfully and I felt relieved. However…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3654"><span class="indent"><span>Just when I was sure that Veldora would win, things began to change rapidly. And then things took a turn for the worse…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3655"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3656"><span class="indent"><span>Suddenly, a flying ship appeared in the combat airspace. A man in a different military uniform stood at the bow of the ship. It was Lieutenant </span><span data-term="Kondou" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.

The ritual had ended when Velgrynd had released ‘Parallel Existence’. I had lost my composure to the extent that I did not notice it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3657"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3658"><span class="indent"><span>«Re</span></span><span class="indent"><span>port.

I had a bad feeling about this. Not knowing what they were up to made my heart beat faster than it should. At that moment, another figure appeared on the bow of the airship. He looked exactly the same as the man who was sitting in front of me right now. </span><span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>…?

There was no way that a bullet would work against Veldora, a ‘True Dragon’ which was the strongest race in the world. Yet before such a thought could even flash through my mind, the bullet pierced Veldora at an unbelievable speed. It exceeded the speed of sound and reached sub-light speed. The bullet pierced Veldora’s body, but did not penetrate. And then, it released the evil power. Veldora began to suffer pain. Normally, his wounds would recover immediately, but this moment was fatal. </span><span data-term="Rudra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, in the image screen, held out his hand towards Veldora.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3663"><span class="indent"><span>“Let me tell you something.
