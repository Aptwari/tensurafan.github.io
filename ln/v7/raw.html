He is also highly capable. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why no one is doubting him, and all have accepted Laplace&rsquo;s report of his vanquishing a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No one realizes the lies in his report, so the meeting continues.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">With that being said, things are getting more difficult.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I suppose. The base, army and treasure that we gave to Clayman are all gone. We&rsquo;ve suffered a heavy loss.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The black-haired youth nods in response to Kazaream&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The content of the conversation is concerning, and Tear throws out a question.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh, what does that mean?

Their base still has that crazy saint Adalman. That Undead King is quite strong, even rivaling us. And while that Undead Dragon wasn&rsquo;t at the same level as the Charybdis, it still would pose a significant threat. Are the curse spells cast by president still in effect?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">First Tear, then Footman inquires in surprise. Upon hearing so, the young man and Kazaream look at each other awkwardly and make their bitter response.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what we want to discuss with you today.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I handed over the base to Clayman, and it was taken last night. The unbelievable thing is, that slime only sent a few subordinates to do so.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What did you say?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No way!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">How is it possible?!

Footman raises his face, seeming to have recalled something.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Seeing his reaction, the young man nods and responds.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed. Didn&rsquo;t the footage recorded by Laplace include those Majins? It&rsquo;ll be best if we face facts and recognize that every one of them has the combat ability of Special Rank A.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hearing this, even Footman became speechless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;Seriously?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Tear mumbles. But no one responds.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">At least that slime named Rimuru did not take part in that battle. If I have to deduce, he may have used the battle as a bait for him to take down Clayman&rsquo;s base in person. If it&rsquo;s that slime, it won&rsquo;t be strange for him to have broken through my proud defense system.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With Kazaream&rsquo;s explanation, everyone finally realizes the severity of the situation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then the young man opens up:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why we have to redraft our plans for the future.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He declares that, having lost most of their combat forces, they should halt all on-going operations. Moreover, the death of Clayman has left them all with keenly-felt anguish&hellip;&hellip; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Fortunately, they haven&rsquo;t lost everything. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve kept part of their assets as insurance, as well as their organization based in the Western Nations&mdash;&mdash;With these two resources to back them up, they still have some level of political influence over the nations. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They also sent out fine subordinates, not skilled in direct combat, but excellent in intelligence gathering, to ascertain the movement of all nations. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The youth started this organization from nothing, so there is always room to come back, even from such dire straits.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is for this reason&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">We will need to lay low for a while. It&rsquo;s truly a shame what happened to Clayman, but we will have to stand against the Demon Lords in order to avenge him. Yet our power is still too weak for that as of this moment. In order to realize our ambition of world domination, we will have to bear this burden for now.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This sentiment is unanimous.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes. Our organization has grown a lot in the past ten years.

That&rsquo;s also why Clayman got cocky.&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hmm, although I don&rsquo;t intend to give up (on revenge), it seems like we&rsquo;d lose everything if I act too hastily now.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t want to admit it either, but patience is the right course now&hellip;&hellip;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Not everyone agrees, but the Majins eventually accept the his suggestion as the most reasonable course of action.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hahaha, you should try to accept it, Footman. I still have all of you as my trump cards.

These are truthful words from the young man and the reason behind his decision. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After all, if he hadn&rsquo;t given them this talk here and now, some of them may be have thrown their life away in rage and grief .</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Footman then decides to endure after learning where the young man is coming from.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I understand, boss.

While we may not be able to work with our hands, can&rsquo;t we at least use our words? That slime has taken everything from Clayman, so we should give him a taste of the same medicine.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The young man says with a twisted grin.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What are you planning?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Kazaream asks, but the young man does not give a direct response. He answers with a smile:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That is no simple slime. He was able to accumulate a great amount of power in only a few years. Honestly, it is astonishing, and normally we shouldn&rsquo;t antagonize him. Instead, we should determine how strong they really are. To do so, I have arranged a trap.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The young man pauses after saying so delightfully.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Seriously, are you being devious again?

But I am worried about whether the monsters who we&rsquo;ve now staved off will go on to cause harm in other regions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Perhaps I should run an investigation regarding the issue&mdash;&mdash;I think as I travel alongside Veldora and Shion, entering the city upon Ranga&rsquo;s back.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As soon as I enter the town, the residents and the patrolling soldiers begin to kneel down on the side of &nbsp;the streets gradually opening up a path. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Their movements are all well coordinated, most likely from training that I was not aware of.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What are they doing? As I observe skeptically, Diablo saunters towards us from the end of the road. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His expression is overflowing with joy as he flashes a bright smile. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo then exchanges looks with Rigurd&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Welcome back, Rimuru-sama!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Congratulations on becoming an Eight-Star Demon Lord! We are most thankful for your safe return!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rigurd, acting as the representative, greets me respectfully, followed by Diablo&rsquo;s congratulatory words.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Wait a minute, what is going on here?! How do you know about me officially becoming a Demon Lord!? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And about that title, it should only have been revealed at that meeting with its debut. Because it was me who came up with the&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I wondered while my head filled with doubts. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shouldn&rsquo;t Diablo be taking down Farmus Kingdom right now? How would he have the time to plan out such a specific activity?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I feel quite embarrassed, so I decide to ask him directly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Very simple, Rimuru-sama. I asked a favour of Veldora-sama.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo replies cheerfully.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I glance towards Veldora only to realize he was desperately averting my gaze. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oi, excuse me! Mister?!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">From his reaction alone, I could tell he did something against his conscience. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I got Veldora to confess after some interrogation. He seems to have made a deal with Diablo. Diablo, in return, offered meals and three servings of dessert. If he did, Veldora promised to tell him what happened during the Banquet in detail&hellip;.. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So that&rsquo;s how it was. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s how he got wind of how I&rsquo;ve been approved to become a Demon Lord in the meeting and also passed on the new title of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eight-Star Demon Lord</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Should I praise Diablo for his skillfulness in intelligence gathering? &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Normally, one wouldn&rsquo;t even dare to come up with the idea, let alone put it into practice. One must then have sufficient mobility and capacity to bribe someone as strong as Veldora. Although Veldora, who agreed to the deal, is pretty dumb, Diablo&rsquo;s resolve in carrying it out shows he is no ordinary man. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And since the two are willing to give the bait and take the bait respectively, I&rsquo;ll cut myself short on the subject.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With that being said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Veldora, do you even need to eat?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">W-What nonsense is that, Rimuru!? Eating or not is not the point, the point is that I want to eat things. And if that&rsquo;s really the case, you don&rsquo;t need to eat either!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ouch! I got retorted.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But he does have a point.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t exactly criticize without being called hypocritical on the matter. Lately, Shuna&rsquo;s culinary skill has grown a lot, and she has also produced a large variety of desserts. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now she can even recreate pastry puffs that have just been introduced at the cafe in Ingracia Kingdom. Not even pudding poses a challenge to her. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover, with the addition of a variety of alcoholic beverages, we can now develop even more new desserts. The cafe manager Mister Yoshida would also aid us in the process of developing new dishes. To gain his assistance, I prepared a variety of wines to send regularly, as that was his demand.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Mister Yoshida also said </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Now I can recreate previously impossible cuisines!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with a delightful expression. With all these efforts, we were able to develop several new dishes and incorporate them into daily meals. Veldora is probably also shocked having tasted the food after his resurrection at the festival.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Veldora, you were tempted by the food, weren&rsquo;t you? &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With that being said, Milim was also tempted by honey&hellip;...</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">An idea suddenly crosses my mind&mdash;&mdash;we may be able to take over the world with culinary supremacy. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My musings were suddenly interrupted by the sounds of Shion and Diablo quarrelling.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Have you fulfilled your duty as Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s bodyguard?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Most certainly! It has been proven that as long as I&rsquo;m around, you are simply unnecessary. I should be the one to question you about the progress of the mission assigned to you by Rimuru-sama.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Kufufufufufu, it has proceeded without a flaw. In fact, I was just about to report back to Rimuru-sama myself.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The two flashed each other bright smiles that did not quite seem to reach the eyes. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They simply wouldn&rsquo;t let up on each other and continue to bicker.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You two, behave yourselves!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right. Rimuru-sama is tired as well. Haruna and the rest have been preparing food. Let&rsquo;s relax for now and come back to this conversation later. </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rigurdo agrees to my view and scolds the two on my behalf. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As expected of Rigurdo. Lately, he&rsquo;s been acting more and more prestigious. Now he seems very dependable. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We were moved to another spot at Rigurdo&rsquo;s urging.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The town folk all have joyful expressions. I was hoping to start a feast as soon as possible to have some fun with everyone, but Benimaru and the rest have yet to return from their expedition. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve decided to delay our celebration feast. Right now, we&rsquo;ll wind things down and have just a bit of fun for resolving our trouble.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We went to take a bath in the hot spring and enjoyed the food Haruna prepared.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We listened to Diablo&rsquo;s report after everyone settled down and got in the proper frame of mind. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With our victory against Clayman, our only issues left to tackle were building a new kingdom on Youmu&rsquo;s side and what to do with the Western Saints Church. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Apart from that, there&rsquo;s also the issue of our future relations with Beast Kingdom Yuurazania, Harpy Kingdom</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Fulbrosia and the Worshipers of Dragon who worships Milim&hellip;&hellip; we could resolve these diplomatic issues peacefully, so there isn&rsquo;t too much to worry about there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I ask Diablo in a rather casual mood while sipping my postprandial red tea: </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">So what is it that you are doing now? Eliminating Farmus Kingdom and crowning Youmu as the new king&mdash;&mdash;You dropped the mission and returned, do you need any reinforcement?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I casually turn back to my slime form, which I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to doing. Relaxed, I am hugged by Shion on her lap. I probed Diablo with a question as I felt two soft mounds pressed against the back of my head. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If Diablo is in need of back-up, I plan to send Souei&rsquo;s party to aid him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Right now they are very much available for order, so there is no need to force Diablo to fend for himself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, Shion suddenly interjects and says rather disdainfully: </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">A Cheap-shot nobody like him only deserves to make tea for Rimuru-sama. I should have been the one to attend to such matter! </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;But I ignore her since that type of job is clearly not suitable for Shion.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I spoke with the intention of aiding Diablo&mdash;&mdash;But as it turns out, I was worried over nothing </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No no no, Rimuru-sama. There is no such need. Everything has been going well according to plan.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo refills my second cup of red tea and begins his report.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Drinking tea in slime form is a pain, so I decide to just appreciate the fragrance of it while listening to his report.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But the previously relaxed atmosphere quickly vanished the moment Diablo began to speak. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">First of all, I had to restore the captives into their original states. After all, it is quite the inconvenience to keep them as meatloaf&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">MEATLOAF!??</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Eh? Does he mean what I think it is?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion&rsquo;s body suddenly shivers as she seems to have sensed the source of my disbelief </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s right&hellip;&hellip;. It was indeed the case. Things really won&rsquo;t work out if my people keep acting like this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I visited the interrogation room once, once! I was just planning to have a peek. But now I regret it greatly. It would probably have been best if I had avoided visiting at all. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I left the captives to Shion&rsquo;s care after seeing them and reminded her to </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t overdo things</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">........</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My logic then was&mdash;&mdash;there was nothing to worry about as long as Shion doesn&rsquo;t kill them. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now it is too late for me to regret my actions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">While I feel unease inside, but expressing my regret now would not solve anything. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Displaying no traces of my inner turmoil, I ask for Diablo to continue his report. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Regarding Diablo&rsquo;s first step, it was just as what he has described to Rimuru: to restore Archbishop Rayheim and Head of Court Mage Larzen to their original form.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There were in total two carriages travelling alongside several cavalries as they set out for Farmus Kingdom. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One of the carriages carried Diablo and the three captives.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Well, since Diablo is the only person visible in the six-seated carriage, it would be rather inaccurate to call the other occupants as &lsquo;passengers&rsquo;. That is because the other three people have been squeezed into the luggage on the floor of the carriage.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Indeed, they were squeezed in the form of living meatloaf.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion has turned them into inhuman abominations. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She skinned them one thin layer of skin at a time, but not so much as to kill them; their peeled away layers of flesh exposed the muscle underneath she then decided to slice off their meat piece by piece&hellip;&hellip; Shion has been practicing fish skinning with living people, and she even ensured that the ones getting skinned won&rsquo;t feel any physical pain during the process&hellip;&hellip;. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Using her unique skill </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Cook</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, she was able to push the captives to the point of &nbsp;psychological breakdown. Once they reached their (physical) limits, she would treat them with healing potion and reverse the process to start over.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">To witness their own bodies having been dismembered by another while feeling no pain at all&mdash;&mdash;having suffered such repeated torments, the sanity of the three have been completely obliterated. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Their expressions are devoid of life as they lay submerged in the pool of their own exposed intestines. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is no way they could return to their country in this state. Bearing such thoughts, Diablo, although unwillingly, decided to work on reversing their curse. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">How troublesome&hellip;&hellip; Their senses</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;have been completely twisted, so healing magic won&rsquo;t work directly &hellip;&hellip;. </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Despite his complaints, Diablo was amazed with how useful non-magical skills could be. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He has mastered the art of magic and learnt all about the laws of this world, yet even so, there still exist so many fascinating things out there (that he has yet to know). &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This does cheer Diablo up substantially.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With his mood lifted, he expelled the remaining magic housed within the three left behind by Shion. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">First one is Rayheim;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then Larzen. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This was not done in any specific order. Diablo dispelled the magic with ease. But he stopped at Edmalis, the King of Farmus.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Blessings, thank you!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rayheim rejoiced as he expresses his gratitude towards Diablo.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I am not important here, please, the king&hellip;... restore the king&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen begs Diablo out of loyalty for his King.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo slants his eyes coldly at Larzen.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Kufufufufu, are you begging me? Then you should understand that such a request does not come cheap.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Diablo grins disdainfully. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A delightfully devilish smile emerges on Diablo&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, there is not the slightest passion</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">....Ah&hellip;..No&hellip;...I&hellip;...</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen goes pale with fear surged from his heart. He is regretting&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen recalls now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This Diablo, who has been sitting casually in front of him, is a terrifying demon. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">An Archdemon</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;No, he said he isn&rsquo;t kind (cheap) like that</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">On top of that, even an Archdemon alone would be quite a threat. If he was to appear in some smaller country, he would have caused a crisis that could bring the whole nation to its demise.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why they are categorized as Calamity&mdash;&mdash;Threat level up to Special Rank A.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Basic magic barriers would not stand effective. He could easily destroy a nation&rsquo;s defense by unleashing a bit more of his Youki (demonic aura). He may even be capable of crushing his enemies one-sidedly using magic alone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Adventurers below Rank A wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance against him. His presence alone would be the declaration of a death penalty. That is how terrifying the existence of an Archdemon. It is a type of demon that even Larzen wouldn&rsquo;t want to antagonize or deal with alone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, Diablo&rsquo;s presence is rather different.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He seems all too human in appearance without a trace of his demonic aura. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Except his eyes are arresting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They are akin to a golden moon hanging in the darkness of midnight with a dash of ominous red in the middle. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The most appropriate term to describe them would be &ldquo;Unforgettable&rdquo; to whoever looks upon them. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Their appearances are especially unsettling.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Apart from his eyes, the rest of his body all looks very similar to that of a human&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;In other words, even though most nations would install defense mechanisms to block out monsters up to certain level (magicule storage), he could easily infiltrate these cities without batting an eye. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The only difference, and perhaps the only advantage humans have over monsters is their intelligence. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some monsters are intelligent, but these monsters would often want to show off their strength one way or another. For instance, generously having their aura on display to demonstrate how large their magicule storage is.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That is why magic barriers which react to high magicule presence would work against them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But, what would happen if these types of monster decide to conceal their aura? &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A Calamity Rank monster suddenly shows up and strolls around on the streets of human cities&mdash;&mdash;Larzen shuddered at the thought.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words, things would go like this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A nation couldn&rsquo;t help it if its barrier is being destroyed via brute force, but as the enemies tear down the barrier, the nation could reorganize its defensive force. It can then send out this defensive force to face the enemies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However... if the enemies can completely ignore the barrier&mdash;&mdash;The result is probably anyone&rsquo;s guess.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These types of monsters would already be at a higher level than Arc Demons, &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo is one of them.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover, his real identity is one of the Primordial Demons&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although in comparison&hellip;...</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is something even more terrifying that he hasn&rsquo;t considered.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This demon called Diablo is already serving a master.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That person is the master of all these monsters, the fearsome yet beautiful man with golden eyes</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and silver-blue hair.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Its hair gives off a feeling of transparency and it glitters like shining glass. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His presence might have been be momentary, yet his power was beyond one&rsquo;s imagination. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is a being truly worthy of the title. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The scene of him massacring the army of twenty-thousand men still sends shivers down Larzen&rsquo;s spine. But Larzen was occupied by another sensation after meeting him in person. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When he was taken captive by others to that place&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The way he looked at Larzen was as if he was a stone by the road.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When those golden eyes met his, so mesmerized was he, to the point of not only forgetting the excruciating pain of his torture, but for him to abandon all fear of death... &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There are beings in this world that you simply should not antagonize.</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t overdo things.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash; these were the words Larzen heard uttered by an angelic voice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It must have been a warning to Larzen.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Telling him to not get ahead of himself. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is no wonder that his country had been destroyed when they are up against such an opponent, who even a Primordial Demon would pledge loyalty to.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">&mdash;&mdash;if it&rsquo;s that Demon Lord, he could single-handedly destroy the entire Farmus Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Such thoughts keeps crossing Larzen&rsquo;s mind. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He ignores the bumping of the carriage and stands up from his seat to supplicate (kneel) before Diablo.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Of course I understand.

How could this happen with Larzen-sama&rsquo;s company! </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The ministers shrieked, barely able to contain the fear and panic in their voices. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You can&rsquo;t exactly blame them for being this way. Larzen, who is now playing the role of Shougo (Shougo Taguchi), thinks to himself&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">During the days after the regular magic communication was cut, the people remaining in the kingdom have been on their feet the whole time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although they believe their army of twenty-thousand men wouldn&rsquo;t be defeated due to its overwhelming numbers, everything may have an exception. Right now there is more than enough ground to plant the seed of doubt when they couldn&rsquo;t even confirm the life or death of the king.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then Larzen returned to the nation alongside Archbishop Rayheim. They showed up in the teleportation room within the castle through the Elemental-based Magic </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Waypoint Transportation</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The patrolling soldiers were alerted to the situation as they discovered the two lying unconscious at the location, which led to the event that took place this morning.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The two soldiers hurried to confirm their identities. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">One of whom is the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Otherworlder</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Shougo Taguchi.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The other one is the king&rsquo;s close acquaintance, Archbishop Rayheim.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The soldiers, while shocked, went on to take Rayheim into care, as he has collapsed due to fatigue. They then discover that the young man has been hugging onto a box as if it&rsquo;s a priceless treasure. Without much mental preparation, one of the soldiers peeked in to examine the content of the box.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This soldier belongs to the high ranking Imperial Guards that serve within the palace, and normally he would never make such a horrified scream. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But he did just that, and the reason being the content within the box&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There were slimey gravy leaking out the box accompanied by a disgusting odor&mdash;&mdash;The box contained distorted meatloaf made up of chopped up intestines. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is the abominable sight of what was previously the ruler of this kingdom. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Seeing this, the guard began to scream out of fear, which is considered great disrespect, but no one is condemning him. The people who joined after hearing his scream were also scared to death seeing the same sight. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The servants, the ministers were all in panic upon seeing what their master had become. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some were screaming, crying, and shouting. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some began to vomit. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And some even fainted out of fear. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No one wanted to believe this is the king. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But, this was the reality.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At first, some tried to confirm whether it is the real king or not. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And, as it turned out, it was indeed the real king.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What are you all doing! Go and save the king!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some minister calls out in panic, finally spurring the crowd into mobilization.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All the mages remaining in the palace have been gathered to try out every available spell. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They even summoned high priests from the Western Saints Church to see if they can heal the king.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The sight alone was enough to invoke the deepest primal fear in people&rsquo;s heart. Confronted with such horrific sight, people still made up their mind to try to restore their king to normal. Even though everyone&rsquo;s face has been distorted due to fear, they still kept on working steadfastly. Yet none of them have been effective.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is no way they could save the king.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;The time fast forwards to the present.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Having been informed that Shougo has awakened, the crowds bring their questions to him.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen is rather sympathetic seeing his former colleagues.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But nowadays Larzen is Diablo&rsquo;s subordinate, so he needs to betray his companions without hesitation. Their own choices will decide their fates. But just for a bit, for a tiny bit, Larzen feels sorry for them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everything has been according to Diablo&rsquo;s plan. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Faking his coma was also part of the plan. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As Diablo&rsquo;s servant, Larzen was told what would happen to this nation and what they should do accordingly. Larzen has already come to a realization. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This nation is about to become a toy of the Demon Lord. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If Farmus Kingdom becomes a stage for them to toy around with human puppets, it would be the end of this kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But this doesn&rsquo;t seem to be such an unfortunate fate for the citizens. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As Diablo explains the Demon Lord&rsquo;s plan to Larzen, a sense of hope sparked within his heart. &nbsp;An image of the land of Farmus stepping towards a future of prosperity began to emerge in his head. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The ancient institution must be dismantled in order for that future to come true, Larzen couldn&rsquo;t help but to think so. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why he is acting according to the plan.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Calm down. I am Larzen. I have been protecting the king and was able to escape back to our kingdom with the help of Hero-sama.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What?

But then they start to question Larzen.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You mentioned that you managed to escape, does that mean the Farmus army&hellip;&hellip;.. that our nation&rsquo;s great army has lost to those monsters?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What really happened?

To these people, they didn&rsquo;t even consider the possibility of sustaining financial loss as a result of defeat.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Everyone, please calm down.

Last night Diablo had taken action to establish contact with him through Fuse, the branch head of the Freedom Association in Brumund Kingdom. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everything has been going according to Diablo&rsquo;s plan&hellip;...</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">First, to have Larzen explain that </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The Hero Youmu has gone to negotiate the exchange of a cure (healing potion) with the leader of the monsters.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. This will cause an order to be passed on to the gatekeeper to make preparations to welcome Youmu&rsquo;s party back into the city without the need of identification. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Next, he will explain the situation with the Farmus Army&hellip;&hellip; The crowds are shocked as soon as he begins to explain.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Indeed&mdash;&mdash;because of the line </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon Veldora has been revived</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">H-how could this be&hellip;....</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Why was that evil dragon revived at that place?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I-impossible&hellip;&hellip;. Hasn&rsquo;t Veldora been defeated already!?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Then we must hurry and report to the Western Saints Church to request the aid of the Holy Knight Order (Crusader)!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">We are done for now! If what Larzen-sama just said is true, we won&rsquo;t be able to do anything about it. All our reserve combat forces in the nation wouldn&rsquo;t at all be sufficient to face such enemy.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right! We have to get the (Farmus) Knight Order back as soon as possible!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed. If </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Magic Communication</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;won&rsquo;t work, we will have General Folgen to relay the message.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">There is no time for that! We should all bail now before the people catch wind of this, or else we won&rsquo;t even have time to escape!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some have been struck in panic by fear. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some are pressing to strike first. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some even suggest to evacuate without the citizens. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone has a different reaction. Then, Marquis M&uuml;ller gave the crowd a shout to shut everyone up.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Silence! Even if the Knight Order is fine, the result would be the same. By the way, Sita-sama, would it really help if we panic like you? Where would we escape to? That </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is a real Rank-Catastrophe monster.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The ministers begin to regain their composure. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen continues his explanation after this momentary silence. He then begins to explain what happened on the battlefield. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He retells the complete defeat of the Farmus Army&mdash;&mdash;The tragedy (made-up lie) that led to the disappearance of the entire army as a result of the resurrection of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Veldora.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The crowds fall into silence after Larzen&rsquo;s explanation. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone is speechless. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The entire thing seems too ridiculous to be true. Everyone thinks that it would be obvious. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is under such circumstances that some begin to raise doubts about the situation while Larzen answers them one by one.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">L-Larzen-sama, is this all true? Is it true that our army has disappeared without a trace?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes. Our army was fighting those monsters when the dragon of that land was awakened.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What nonsense is this, how strange would that be! Even the Western Saints Church has told us that they&rsquo;ve eliminated all the dragons, are you suggesting that they&rsquo;ve been lying to us?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No, that&rsquo;s not the case. Veldora would disappear for a period of time. However, a </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">True Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;cannot be eliminated. It will eventually be reborn in some corner of the world. But we simply couldn&rsquo;t have anticipated that the interval was so short, and that it was revived so nearby&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Larzen-sama, what happened to the other survivors?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Y-yeah, what about General Folgen? You mentioned that all of the army has gone missing, but shouldn&rsquo;t there at least be a few persons left?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Upon being asked so, Larzen responds with his head shaked.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In reality, they&rsquo;ve all been killed by the fury of Rimuru. But Diablo has discussed this with Larzen and ordered him to cover up the matter with the lie that the army has gone missing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What do you mean by that?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve already told you, they&rsquo;ve gone missing. With Veldora&rsquo;s revival, both the knights and monsters at the scene vanished. We were the only ones who remained&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No way&mdash;&mdash;!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll ask this one more time, there is no survivor who escaped at all&hellip;&hellip;. and have they really all gone missing?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">There were supply corps behind the frontline&hellip;.. Are they okay?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen falls silent. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His eyes fell to the ground quietly. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Seeing this, everyone has to take his words for it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;The Knight Order has truly been annihilated.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A minister suddenly breaks into tears.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He was the one that asked about the well-being of the supply corps. Because he had sent his son to fight his first war. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He even pulled some strings to move his son to the rear to distance him from the dangerous frontline. Yet all of his efforts were for nothing. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At the end of the day, he only allowed his son to join this war because he believed there was a fortune to rob from the monsters, and that victory was ensured. In the face of this twisted turn of fate, he broke down in tears.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But in overview of this tragic event, he is just one of the victims. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The total number of people missing in action amount to an astounding twenty thousand. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That is an unprecedented loss of life. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even though they are labeled as &ldquo;missing in action,&rdquo; the hope of them returning is zero. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They are as good as dead.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone now can&rsquo;t help but think that this has to do with Veldora&rsquo;s revival. To be more specific, they think the vanished army was used as a live sacrifice. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Veldora is thus under this false accusation, which works in Rimuru&rsquo;s favour. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo&rsquo;s wise plan has successfully manipulated the beliefs of the top ministers of Farmus Kingdom through Larzen. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is during this time, almost as if it is perfectly timed, sounds of footstep begin to echo in the throne room.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is Youmu&rsquo;s party. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The ones accompanying him are his advisor Myuran, bodyguard Grucius, and secretary Rommel the mage. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo, dressed in a neat butler outfit, is the last one to enter. However, his attitude is quite arrogant in juxtaposition of his role as a butler. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The throne room of this castle is normally not accessible to people low in the social hierarchy, such as adventurers. However, with Larzen&rsquo;s intervention, their guides were ordered beforehand to lead Youmu to this location.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Sorry to keep you guys waiting. I&rsquo;ve finally managed to convince that guy.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Youmu speaks to Larzen while representing his party. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He still couldn&rsquo;t quite change his rude tone and straight-forward attitude. After all, the noble style isn&rsquo;t bred in one day, so you can&rsquo;t really blame him. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But in the eyes of the nobles, his attitude can only be described as brusque. This led to some vocal discontent.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Who on earth are you! How rude of you to speak in such plebeian tone!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although Youmu has arrived with the medicine to cure the king&mdash;&mdash;a matter that was brought up before, one of the ministers still reprimanded him. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Of course, he has heard the name of Hero Youmu. He has also seen Youmu&rsquo;s portraits everywhere he goes. He knows too that it is Youmu who is coming. Moreover, given how special Youmu&rsquo;s full-body armor is, he won&rsquo;t mistaken him for another even if he had only heard of him.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet to this minister, none of these matter. This is the royal palace, and how things work here is different from that of the public sphere&mdash;&mdash;To him it is common sense.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why he couldn&rsquo;t stand how rude Youmu&rsquo;s tone was.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, this caused Larzen to panic. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He looks towards Diablo to see whether the minister&rsquo;s words have provoked him. After all, he never revealed his plans to the ministers, so the outcome, whatever it may be, will fall on Larzen&rsquo;s shoulders. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He understands why the minister shouted out those words. There is nothing wrong with such action if it&rsquo;s any other day. But right now, it is simply inappropriate given the gravity of the situation. Larzen regrets having not explained the details of some matters and decides to steps in as the mediator. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Please hold on a second, Carlos-dono. These people are our saviours. We are relying on them to save our King!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What? These are the people who saved you?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t believe Larzen, guardian of this kingdom, would say something like this. What really happened out there?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even though some of them are still not convinced, Larzen remains, after all, the best mage in Farmus Kingdom. His power as a magic caster is unquestionable, in addition to his hundreds of years&rsquo; feat of guarding the kingdom. Larzen&rsquo;s words are no comments to pass by their head, the nobles then decide to take it down a notch for the time being.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With that being said, they are only reacting so violently due to the imminent destruction of their nation and the revival of Veldora. That&rsquo;s why they were bluffing. Because of that, they were able to get the details of how Larzen was saved. They&rsquo;ve now learnt whether their personal safety can be ensured or not.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Just as Larzen is about to answer their doubts, someone interjects from the side.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Allow me to answer that question for you.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s Archbishop Rayheim.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He is pretending that his body has just recovered, and he came to fill in the gaps of Larzen&rsquo;s story.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen celebrates internally and exchanges a look with Rayheim, then surreptitiously glances at Diablo to see him smiling at how things are progressing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reassured, Larzen allows Rayheim to do the explanation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Then, could you enlighten us about how Larzen-sama&rsquo;s party has been saved?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">With regards to the revival of </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">, Larzen-sama has informed you of the matter. The two armies clashed on the warfield and engaged in an intense fight. We were advantageous in terms of number, but those monsters had a better fortified position. The battle was harder fought than we imagined. </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The hall falls silent with only Rayheim&rsquo;s voice.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He eyes Diablo as he continues his explanation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">According to him, the chaotic aura of the warfield was key to Veldora&rsquo;s revival. And as Veldora suddenly emerges on the battlefield, he attacked indiscriminately and both sides suffered the consequences.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen nods in agreement and adds.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I was there alongside Rayheim-sama. We really went all out trying to protect our king. </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He emphasizes on his inability. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rayheim continues on top of that: </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed, it was just like that. I was staying in the base behind the frontline alongside Larzen-sama. We were truly desperate at the sights before us as the tragedy unfolds. We witnessed Death himself before our eyes as the majestic </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;devastated everything. We were both prepared to die before someone showed up between us and the </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen peeks at Diablo.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He nods in satisfaction. Seeing this, Larzen and Rayheim nods to each other.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;He was the leader of the Monsters, Rimuru-sama.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed. Both Rayheim-sama and I thought our death was at our doorstep. But, Rimuru-sama, ruler of the Monsters showed up to persuade Veldora-sama.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen&rsquo;s words bewildered and shocked the crowds.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Persuaded? Could they communicate with each other?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Speaking of that, it is no different from suicide to get in the way of that evil dragon Veldora like that. Most creatures would be killed instantly if bathed in that concentrated amount of magicule.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">About that, how did he&mdash;&mdash;?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A commotion breaks out among the nobles.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If they could communicate perhaps he could truly calm Veldora down. The nobles thought so with much hope and expectation as they looked to Larzen and Rayheim. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Veldora may not invade Farmus Kingdom after all, but it would still be a huge mistake if they just sat here without taking any precautions. But, no one present has a solution to what they need to do next.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now that they got wind of the disappearance of the twenty-thousand elite soldiers, including that of King&rsquo;s Knight Order, no one dares to come out with a half-baked plan to battle Veldora. The best solution they have at the moment is to eliminate the threat of Veldora through negotiation, or so does everyone thinks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">As you all know, this Rimuru-sama is the ruler of Monsters and the leader of the Jura Great Forest.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Didn&rsquo;t he give himself that title?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As one of the minister speaks, Diablo frowns in displeasure.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen quickly interrupts the minister upon seeing this by replying:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s not the case at all. I&rsquo;ve seen the Monster Town with my own eyes, it is more than qualified to be called a capital of a kingdom. Moreover, even the Dryads who oversee the Jura Great Forest follows this Rimuru-sama.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen explains that Rimuru was able to communicate with Veldora through the aid of the Dryads.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These words added some convincing elements to his claims.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The overseers of the forest are rather famous and are known to be powerful monsters that guard the location where Veldora slumbers. According to the ranking of Freedom Association, they are creatures above Rank A, presumed to be Special Rank A, a dangerous species indeed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If even the Dryads decided to follow him, the power of this monster known as Rimuru is clearly not be underestimated. Since every noble here is of a high echelon, they all have hired people to gather valuable information; hence, they all started to realize this fact.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I see&hellip;...</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It would seem we have made a mistake in making him our enemy&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Upon recalling the fact that they were the ones who initiated the attack on the monster Kingdom, the ministers are all troubled by this, although none of them wants to admit.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">This is bad, even if we can negotiate with the evil dragon, we are still enemy with that Rimuru, not good at all&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One of the minister mentions this only to resonate the same sentiments across the board. But they aren&rsquo;t considering the option of asking help from Rimuru to negotiate, instead they are worrying about whether angering Rimuru would further instigate Veldora&rsquo;s tantrum. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is at this moment Youmu, who has previously been completely ignored, steps to the center of the hall., he spoke in a calm voice that garnered the attention of everyone present:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I see how it is then, everyone. You need not worry about that part. When I marched against the Orc Lord, I once worked alongside Rimuru-san. He is a surprisingly good natured person, and wishes to coexist peacefully with humans&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, Youmu was cut short as he was half way through his speech.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oh oh! If that&rsquo;s the case, we shall have Youmu-sama as our mediator to pass on our demands. We shall discuss that matter later. You may await orders in another room.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The noble Carlos, who has just scolded Youmu, interrupts his explanation and gives him the order arrogantly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The difference in social status is truly troubling. Even as a warrior, Youmu is still a civilian in his blood without even a knighthood. Most of noble descent still look down on him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Carlos is a highly-ranked Count and is perhaps the best example of nobles who are too conscious of differences in status. It may be tolerated if he displays this attitude on any other day, but at this instant, given several examples of this poor behavior already, it is most inappropriate to act in this manner. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A few nobles begin to stare at Carlos with discontent, incredulous at his lack of self-awareness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">(Youmu)</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oi oi oi, don&rsquo;t get ahead of yourself now. About that, the man is normally quite nice, but right now the circumstance is different. Surely you all understand the reason behind it.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What do you mean?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Aren&rsquo;t you guys the ones responsible for attacking Rimuru</span><span class="c1 c14">-</span><span class="c1">san</span><span class="c1 c14">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s</span><span class="c1 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">country right? Bad idea. Some of Rimuru-san&rsquo;s companions ended up dead. He was livid with indignation.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">How dare a mere plebeian spit out such nonsense! Who gave you permission to meddle in state affairs! It is simply convenient that you happen to be on good terms with that Rimuru something, and as a hero, you should also do your duty to act as a mediator, so figure something out already!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ignoring Youmu&rsquo;s words, the arrogant Carlos says so without feeling a shred of shame.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Youmu resents being talked down to..</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Tsk, that&rsquo;s why I hate nobles&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Youmu complains to himself internally, while still maintaining a calm facade, and continues his explanation:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Now listen here, y&rsquo;all need to first listen to what I have to say. You didn&rsquo;t seem to have sent any envoy or declaration of war prior to the invasion. Instead, didn&rsquo;t you send the </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Otherworlders</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to cause a riot there? I had indeed gone to negotiate a peace and &nbsp;was dumbfounded to learn of this this. But still, the Farmus Kingdom is nonetheless my home. I don&rsquo;t intend to see my homeland destroyed either, so I somehow managed to calm him down and beg him to negotiate for peace. Besides, Larzen-san there has also asked me of the same favour.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Youmu suppresses his anger and finishes his explanation. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If the arrogant nobles decided to cause a scene just now during his explanation, the fall of Farmus Kingdom would have been assured, Youmu thinks to himself having sensed the aura emitted by Diablo behind his back.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Youmu only truly realized the meaning of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Evil</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;after meeting Diablo. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He knows this crowd in front of him are merely petty scoundrels. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">True evil would not play along the score of any authority. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They are true egoists who only act out of their own will. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Right now the only thing keeping Diablo from lashing out is his loyalty towards Rimuru&rsquo;s command. But if he is to lose his temper at this point, it would be bad for Youmu&rsquo;s coming kingship. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If he handles the nobles too kindly, it would lead to future nuisances. But if he is to kill them off, it will most certainly lead to a bad name among the pubic. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The most ideal situation is to have the opposing nobles start a conflict by themselves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Diablo has kept silent and has only been observing quietly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But there are still rooms for doubts. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If the nobles are to seriously piss off Diablo, the situation may escalate very quickly. If he thinks </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">There is no need to keep these lots alive</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, then the nobles would probably be killed on the spot. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Youmu has discussed about this scenario with Myuran and Grucius, they also agree about the possibility.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">People who can manipulate someone as strong as Larzen in their palms are powerful minorities even among Greater Majins. And if such person as Diablo decides to get serious, the Farmus Kingdom, which has now lost all of its military force, couldn&rsquo;t at all set up a resistance. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Therefore, Youmu&rsquo;s party feels much more nervous as compared to the nobles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen shares the same sentiment as Youmu.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo clearly doesn&rsquo;t care about human lives, whether those of nobles or civilians.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They are of no value to him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is obvious from how he treated King Edmalis. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is hard to imagine what Diablo would do if someone dares insult the Monster Ruler Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It will be fine if the noble Carlos is the only one he inflicts his rage on. But if they don&rsquo;t handle this well, every single citizen may be wiped out.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Knowing this very clearly, Larzen tries his hardest to hide how daunted he felt and agrees with Youmu&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Carlos-sama, please behave yourself now!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What! Larzen-sama, are you siding with this damn peasant!?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I told you to shut up! Don&rsquo;t butt in when you aren&rsquo;t aware of the circumstances!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen rebukes Carlos harshly.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Surprised to see someone as composed and calculated as Larzen break down like this, even the other nobles decided to remain quiet and observe the situation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Listen up, everyone. What Youmu-sama just spoke of is all true. We were doomed to defeat once Shougo and the other two were killed by the Monster lieutenants (top brass) and the </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;killed off our frontal assault. The only survivors were me, Rayheim-sama, and King Edmalis. We were captured and were only released thanks to Youmu-sama&rsquo;s kind intervention.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen begins to recite the prepared materials.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No one is doubting him and things moves on smoothly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Larzen, Rayheim and Youmu take turns speaking while Marquis M&uuml;ller and Earl Hermann frequently intervene to keep things well in hand. Their play to cover each other up is able to convince the ministers gathered at the location.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;if that&rsquo;s the case, the king was cursed on the battlefield and ended up like this, right?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The Monster king only agreed to assist us after the King&rsquo;s promise of peaceful co-existence&hellip;&hellip;..</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">How could the great kingdom of Farmus submit to the rules of monsters?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But, this can&rsquo;t be helped. Or else do you wish to wage war against them? If we are to fight against them, </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;would become our enemy!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No, about that&hellip;...</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even the trump cards </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Otherworlders</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;couldn&rsquo;t win against the Monster Generals. On top of that, they would also need to deal with a revived Veldora. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They look down on the Monster Kingdom of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Jura Tempest Federation</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, but right now their military might alone has outmatched the Farmus Kingdom. It would be absolutely foolish trying to confront them head-on now. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The king must have been forced to admit defeat too&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s what the crowds believe.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And then, a conclusion is reached.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s accept this proposal for now. Does anyone object?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Most people begin to nod in agreement after hearing Marquis M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s words. Although Some may be unpleasant about the decision, none of them dared to raise their opinion. There is a consensus among the ministers to halt the war. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Just like that, Farmus Kingdom decided to enter negotiation with Tempest Federation. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With the dust settled on that matter, Diablo decides that it is time for him to take action.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Kufufufufu, wise choice. Then I shall release the king as promised.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With that being said, he casually steps forward.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Who are you&mdash;&mdash;!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">My apologies. My </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">name</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is Diablo; Subject to my majestic ruler, Rimuru-sama and his loyal butler.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo announces proudly.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Most ministers look confused upon hearing his name, not knowing how to respond. Diablo&rsquo;s attitude seems all too natural for them to interject at all. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His self-introduction however has rendered someone in fear, that being Larzen.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Only Larzen realizes the implication of his words.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He understands what it means for a demon to have a &ldquo;name&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are many things in this world that proves the idiom &ldquo;Ignorance is bliss&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;Larzen secretly envies the ignorant ones and sighs behind everyone&rsquo;s back.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some people remained vigilant towards Diablo and plan to strike when the opportunity reveals. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These are the imperial knights, who have been observing everyone&rsquo;s action in the dark. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo walks straight towards the king&rsquo;s throne. The knights move to block him.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo doesn&rsquo;t even care one bit as he approaches the box on the throne. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some of the imperial knights were shocked as their bodies becomes numb, rendering them unable to move. They couldn&rsquo;t even make a sound.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The royal guards are considered Rank A by the standard of the Freedom Association. Even the ones not up to Rank A are considered elites of elites among Rank Bs. They remained in the royal palace to guard the members of the royal family as well as the head ministers. They can be considered as the strongest combat force in Farmus Kingdom. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are around a hundred knights in the room, yet all are unable to move an inch before Diablo. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But Diablo hasn&rsquo;t done anything yet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is out of fear. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is out of their sharp survival instincts that they&rsquo;ve realized how dangerous Diablo is.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Be a doll, will you?

He then continues to move forward in front of the box where King Edmalis, who has been turned into meatloaf, resides. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo takes out the full recovery potion from his pocket and pours on the meatloaf that is King Edmalis. And without anyone&rsquo;s notice, he removes the spell on the king casted by Shion.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A dramatic change takes place.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With the potion poured onto him, the king&rsquo;s body is instantly restored to its healthy form.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And so does Diablo&rsquo;s plan come to fruition. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The doctors and mages are all amazed and begin to cheer after witnessing the king being transformed back to human form after they&rsquo;ve exhausted all available options.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">W-What is this medicine&hellip;&hellip;?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">This is the Full Recovery Potion </span><span class="c1 c11">TM</span><span class="c1">.

After all, this potion will become the main commodity of the Tempest Federation. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Full Recovery Potion&mdash;&mdash;An item that could allegedly to be dug up from ruins of ancient magic kingdoms. It is a legendary healing potion that would even heal amputated limbs after consumption, whose fame is only rivaled by that of the resurrection potion. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The recipe for the potion has been long lost, but it is rumored that the dwarves have been trying to recreate it&hellip;&hellip;. If it can be mass-produced, there would be countless people coming after the potion.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gabil has revealed the specifics of it to Diablo prior, and he caught wind of Rimuru&rsquo;s intent of promoting the potion. Unlike Shion, he was able to complete the intelligence collection within a very short period of time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is because of Diablo&rsquo;s wit that he was able to put on this dramatic and effective play under such circumstances by exploiting the King of Farmus.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His dedication can only be described as perfect.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One can see how Diablo never compromises in terms of his personality.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why it is terrifying to make an enemy like him&hellip;...</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As for Larzen and Rayheim, who both feared that Diablo would massacre everyone in the castle, Diablo has long sensed their thoughts, but he wasn&rsquo;t planning to do such thing at all.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If he did such things, Rimuru would no longer trust him. And since the plan of crowning Youmu as the new king has fallen on his shoulders, Diablo would not make such a simple blunder. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He calculates with cunningness and uses both fear and compassion as his tools.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The two tactics cycled in practice, he is able to puppeteer the beliefs of these highly ranked nobles&mdash;&mdash;the heads of this nation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He believes it would be wiser to make them obedient rather than pitting them against us. Next, he would single out fools who picked the wrong side and eliminate them. That is the general direction of Diablo&rsquo;s plan.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The crowds hold their breath as the king was restored back to his human form under everyone&rsquo;s eyes. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The onlookers must have thought it was entirely the effect of the Full Recovery Potion.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Are you alright?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo asks, while King Edmalis nods with a nervous expression.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Y-yes&hellip;&hellip;..thank you&hellip;&hellip;.for saving me.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The king replies in a weakened tone, partly out of genuine exhaustion.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He is dancing to Diablo&rsquo;s score. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Diablo&rsquo;s unique skill </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Tempter</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is under the same system of law as Rimuru&rsquo;s unique skill </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Heartless One</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. He is able to use his skill to achieve complete dominance over whomever pledges loyalty to Diablo.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Now that King Edmalis has already been affected by </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Tempter</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, if he is to have any thought of betrayal, Diablo would immediately be aware of it. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Seeing that the king has been restored, the servants quickly fetch his clothes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The king got a moment to rest with his clothes on as Diablo signals him with his eyes.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The king nods in response.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Well then, King of Farmus. My liege Rimuru-sama has a message for you.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Speak then, honorable envoy of Tempest Federation.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At this instant, the King of Farmus has acknowledged the Tempest Federation to be a nation. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is undoubtedly a gesture to everyone at the scene.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is King Edmalis&rsquo; proclamation to them that any future affair with Tempest Federation would be that between nations and acknowledging Tempest Federation to be a negotiable subject with a functioning society.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As such, Diablo has been officially received as the messenger sent by a hostile nation Farmus is at war with.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis has welcomed him with the highest honor, but personally he did so to avoid provoking Diablo. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thanks to the King&rsquo;s announcement, the opposing nobles are no longer voicing their opinions. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Regardless, they don&rsquo;t intend to continue the conflict further. So perhaps the king&rsquo;s announcement was more to protect his own subjects rather than announcing for the sake of Diablo.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Very well, allow me to deliver the message. A week from now, his grace hopes both kingdoms would send out representatives to sign a peace treaty here. But before we reach a peaceful agreement, here are the demands we propose to your nation&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo takes out a piece of parchment from his pocket.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;I shall grant you the chance to choose&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With this being the header, the parchment contains the written conditions for a truce demanded by yours truly Rimuru&mdash;&mdash;But only in name, the actual content of the conditions are in reality, Diablo&rsquo;s demands.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The content is quite excessive.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Option one, the king is to abdicate and compensate for the war. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Option two, Farmus is to surrender and be vassalized by Tempest Federation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Option three, which is barely an option at all, both option one and two are rejected and the war would continue to burn Farmus to the ground.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What would appear to be the maintenance of their current status quo is, in fact, an illusion. Now that they&rsquo;ve acknowledged the Tempest Federation as a legitimate nation, their action of waging war against Tempest Federation without a declaration of war wouldn&rsquo;t stand justified. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At least not by the surrounding nations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Western Saints Church would probably be busy fighting Veldora, that&rsquo;s why the crowd think they won&rsquo;t bother to save the Farmus Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The demands are more like threats.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is telling them to either agree or die. They have to make room for agreement to prevent the destruction of their nation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo intentionally raises the parchment high and recites its content dramatically. With a delighted expression, he joyfully awaits the nobles&rsquo; reactions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As soon as he finishes reading the treaty, some minister begins to mumble to themself </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">This is just coercion&hellip;...</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;However, that doesn&rsquo;t much concern Diablo as he bows towards King Edmalis.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;These are our demands. You have one week from today. Do give us your response by that time.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">W-wait! That&rsquo;s quite rush with the timing! We&rsquo;ll need at least a month&mdash;&mdash; </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hush. I don&rsquo;t have such patience.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No, you can&rsquo;t leave it like this! This is no small feat that we can decide with a palace meeting alone. We will have to gather nobles from around the region and decide through the national council of Farmus Kingdom&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Did I not tell you to hush? I care not in the slightest of any difficulty you may have in doing so. But heed this well: don&rsquo;t try anything funny. I&rsquo;ll not accept any excuse to delay the matter. If we don&rsquo;t hear from you in seven days, we will consider that your nation has chosen option three: </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">War</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">. Consider this before giving your answer.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo finishes what he has to say and leaves the Farmus King and the nobles without even turning his head.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How stubborn! Someone shouts, but Diablo won&rsquo;t change his mind for such a petty thing. He leaves Youmu&rsquo;s party as soon as he finishes his business here.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After Diablo&rsquo;s departure, King Edmalis issues orders to summon all of the nobles to an Imperial Conference</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The meeting was planned to be three days later.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; Even with the use of magic, the available time is still quite limited for all of the nobles to be gathered.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; But that really can&rsquo;t be helped since Diablo has only given them a week. A solution must be drafted before that time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The timing is indeed pressing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why the king has put out the order in such a rush to summon all the nobles within three days.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The king&rsquo;s servants begin to hasten their movements. The scene becomes rather busy as everyone prepares for the meeting.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis looks exhausted as he glances around the crowd.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I believe my fellow ministers have realized the magnitude of the issue too. We shall draft a plan for the future before all the nobles are gathered. Tomorrow, we will alter the location, so I may share my thoughts with you all. I shall listen to your opinions then.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He says so rather powerlessly while looking at his trusted subordinates.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What he is certain of at the moment is that the Farmus Kingdom is stepping towards its demise. Because of the high stakes, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any bickering among his inner circle. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But there would undoubtedly be endless conflicts when the conference is held.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why the king is trying to get everyone on the same page before the Imperial Conference is held.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;in addition, he needs to prevent unnecessary sacrifices. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis has secretly made up his mind as he plans these things out.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The next day, </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The location is switched to the conference room where the crowd convenes once more.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The ones being summoned are all the most trusted subordinates of the king. Apart from them, for unknown reasons Marquis M&uuml;ller, the leading figure of the centrists, and his follower, Earl Hermann, are also present.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In order to clear up the situation, King Edmalis begins to explain the ins and outs of the whole event.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone listens to the king in silence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even though both Larzen and Rayheim have spoken on the issue, the ministers are now finally plunged into silence having recognized the frightening reality.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Marquis M&uuml;ller suddenly opens up to ask the king:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Your Majesty&hellip;&hellip; Is it true? Did you say that Veldora has been revived?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Just as Larzen and Rayheim have said. In my opinion, the only issue is which one of the three options are appropriate for us. Moreover, we need to discuss our future plans past this event.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis gives his confirmation and urges the crowd to give their opinions on the matter.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve been waiting for the king&rsquo;s permission, so the crowd begin to express their views.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Jura Great Forest is a forbidden land guarded by Veldora. Even the Eastern Empire doesn&rsquo;t dare to march on it unprepared. It would be utmost foolishness for us to challenge it alone.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">T-that&rsquo;s most true!

With that being said, it leaves us with option one and two&hellip;...</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No way can we be vassalized! We may change our stance on the matter, but we can not become servants to monsters&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t hammer it down so quickly. We don&rsquo;t want any more conflicts.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">How could this be! No landed nobility would agree to such madness.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">There will be civil unrest!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Could this be the true intent of those monsters!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Perhaps we should have Your Majesty step down first and pay the reparation. But are you all aware of the details of the reparation? The nation would collapse.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ten thousand Star Gold Coins</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c1">. That exchanges to around a million gold coins. That would be twenty percent of our total national tax.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Impossible&hellip;...</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But consider our options. Isn&rsquo;t it at least better than having our kingdom destroyed?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed. At least they aren&rsquo;t trying to drain our wallet. That means they still have some decency.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">In the end, we still have to accept those conditions&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hmm, I think so too.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis remained silent throughout the period and listened carefully to what the ministers and nobles have to say. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He thinks to himself as he listens. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">How beautiful</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;That person possesses both a petit appearance of a young girl and a menacing aura that affirms his presence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He is the Monster ruler called Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The fearsome Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Simply recalling those experiences renews the fear deep down in his heart. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Dignity and what-not are all overruled by fear. The king doesn&rsquo;t even dare to raise an opposition to his enemy again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Because it reminds him of the days he was turned into meatloaf and force-fed his own hands and feet. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The king does not want to experience that suffering again at any cost, that&rsquo;s why he has made up his mind to convince the ministers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After the defeat, there are still countless things under question.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; The monsters, surprisingly, have principles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;With the birth of a new Demon Lord, the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was also revived.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis realizes his utter defeat as he begins to accept these realities.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He was blinded by his desire and made the wrong judgement. Had he begun their relationship peacefully, there may be a different future they could paint.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But it is all too late at this point.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">&mdash;&mdash;There can&rsquo;t be any missteps from now on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; Diablo mentioned that they can choose whichever out of the three if they so desire. In other words, whichever option selected would all help Diablo to reach his goal. With that being the case, it would be the right call to choose the option with the least potential harm.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis begins to ponder on it by himself, which option would cause the least damage.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Option three is obviously a no go.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Not only the citizens, everyone would be killed. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Option two should be further evaluated. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is an option that can ensure both the well-beings and prosperity of the citizens.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He has had a glance of the beautiful streets of Tempest Federation. In that kingdom, some adventurers are even having a good time hanging out with monsters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Perhaps they are not bad in nature after all&hellip;...</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a beautiful thought that&rsquo;s crossed Edmalis&rsquo; head, but he still decides to not settle on that option.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">It probably won&rsquo;t work. Without witnessing those sights by themselves, people won&rsquo;t place their trust in monsters. Even I would consider these to be tales of a madman had I only heard them in words&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Besides, the nobles have a duty to protect their subjects. Even if the nobles surrender unconditionally, it would be impossible to have them all willingly vassalized. You simply can&rsquo;t force them into obeying, even with hell breaking loose.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It would most likely invoke protests from the neighbouring nations as well, nor would the Monster Kingdom be recognized by the Western State Council. He would most likely ended up being assassinated if he is to ignore these hindrances by using his authority as a king.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As for option one, it seems to be their safest choice. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Abdication of king means exactly what it says, King Edmalis must step down. A new heir would swear not to wage war again and would be given the throne. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is rather coercive considering the amount of reparation they are demanding, but it can&rsquo;t be helped. The cost of peace is much lower than resuming this war.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But that would only be the case if the monsters cease to demand more from his kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is also a hidden agenda behind the two demands. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo has also discussed in length with King Edmalis about it. He wants to crown Youmu as the new king, and on this basis, he will build a new kingdom. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Edmalis has three children, his eldest daughter, youngest daughter, and eldest son. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Both daughters of his have been married to other kingdoms leaving the crown available only to his eldest son, the prince.

Even though this is how one would generally feel, such beliefs would only hold true in urban areas.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The reality is far different. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">To be more specific, the average income of an urban labourer is around six silver coins a day. In terms of monthly income, it is around one-hundred-fifty silver coins, roughly fifteen hundred thousand yens.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Whereas in comparison, a countryfolk may make less than a hundred silver coins in a year. The wage gap between the rich and the poor is quite significant with the latter earning less than a hundred thousand yen a year.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, there aren&rsquo;t that many diversions in this world, so there are fewer places to spend the money, which renders currency to be less necessary. That&rsquo;s why there is no fundamental difference in lifestyle between the two classes even with such a huge wage gap.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words, right now this world&rsquo;s economy is still somewhat healthy without the impact of globalization and inflow of financial capital. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now is the time to build a greater economic body.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo&rsquo;s intelligence is really something else.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When I revealed my plan of coexistence and growth, he seemed to have understood thoroughly the structure of economic dominance. In order make commodities with different value flow in the market, currency is definitely warranted.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If one can control the flow of currency, one would hold the world economy in his grip. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are many nations in this world that use national currency produced by the state, but right now only the general currency produced by Dwargon are mainstream in all markets.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words, it isn&rsquo;t that difficult to build a global economic network by introducing a special currency to this world.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo would probably do so and may have already planned this out.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But we are getting off track. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s talk about the exchange rate of currency that has been settled in this country (Farmus).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A copper coin exchanges to around one hundred yens, a silver coin to ten thousand and a gold coin to approximately one million.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A reparation of ten thousand Star Gold Coins would be demanding around one trillion yens of war compensation. This world is not as materially abundant as Japan from my last life, so there is no need for any nation to ever prepare such an enormous national budget. It is then only natural that such reparation would be considered a ridiculous price.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Aren&rsquo;t you demanding a bit too much?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Kufufufufu, no need to worry. I&rsquo;ve already given them three choices, but in the end they can only choose one. Option three is naturally outside of their consideration while option two is impossible to choose. At the end of the day they will only choose the first and negotiate with us.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But it would save some time for us if they choose option three, Diablo says so laughing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Of course they have to choose the first option. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They may try to negotiate a discount&mdash;&mdash;no, they aren&rsquo;t that stupid. They are probably unable to pay up in one go, so they may negotiate an installment.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo seems to have seen through me and says:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">A discount is not gonna happen, Farmus Kingdom will have to pay in full. But it is hard to achieve in practice. Their economy would probably stagger with all those coins withdrawn from the market.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s true as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s clear that Diablo has some other intent.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">All they can do in response is to&mdash;&mdash;find a scapegoat.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So that&rsquo;s the why.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo&rsquo;s rationale is as follows:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They will first vouch for a down payment and then pay up the remaining debt with other things than coins. Whoever pays up the remaining debt does not matter, they can go on to cut ties with such individuals from Farmus Kingdom. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In this way, they can argue that the Farmus Kingdom has paid up their reparations. They then get to claim they&rsquo;ve done their part even at the cost of provoking us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although this strategy would only work if the people they deal with remain reasonable afterward, but it would be truly problematic if they use it against us.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What would we do if this becomes true?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">We will proceed as planned. We can at least collect a thousand Star Gold Coin, and it would conclude the first phase of our plan.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Eh, hold on a second?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">On what ground do you conclude we would be able to collect at least a thousand Star Gold Coins by then?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oh, so that&rsquo;s what you are asking.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Diablo says, as if implying </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s easy,</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and goes on to explain regarding my question.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In simpler terms, the reason seems to be that the Star Gold Coins cannot be directly used in transactions. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So that&rsquo;s how it is, I finally understood. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I quickly come to realize with his explanation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The value of one Star Gold Coin would be around ten million to a hundred million yens, so exchanging it to gold coins would be quite troublesome. That&rsquo;s why normally no one would think handing out these coins would cause much of any impact since they have no use unless in large scale transactions. Has Diablo noticed this point? &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Gold coins are the primary currency stored for national budget expenditures whereas the Star Gold Coins are stored like securities</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and cannot be casually exchanged. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is no bank in this world, so saving them wouldn&rsquo;t generate any interest. That&rsquo;s why they would probably be more willing to compromise.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo is one hell of a character. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I was just wondering whether we could at least get a hundred to three hundred Star Gold Coins through negotiation. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The reparations for each casualty would be one hundred million yens.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">On top of that, there are also expenses of destroyed buildings and other things. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I thought this is the bottom line that we won&rsquo;t compromise on. But if we can really get one thousand Star Gold Coins like what Diablo said, we won&rsquo;t mind going into a negotiation with them afterward. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One hundred billion yens, that&rsquo;s an amount far beyond my expectation. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But this seems hardly enough for Diablo as he also plans to invoke a civil war.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What a horrifying fella.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What do you intend to do other than having them compensate our loss?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Kufufufufu, King Edmalis may have been released, but he has already become my pawn. To be more specific, under the influence of my unique skill </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Tempter</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">, he would in a sense, act entirely according to my will. </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">King Edmalis is now under the domination of unique skill </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Tempter</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. Diablo thus has control over his life and death. Although he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to force his own will onto the king, Diablo can still take his life if he so wishes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As long as he remains loyal to Diablo, there naturally wouldn&rsquo;t be any issue. But the moment he bears the thought of betrayal, Diablo would be instantly notified. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words, he may be killed at this very moment by Diablo&hellip;&hellip;. Having learned of this relationship, he would probably refrain from betraying.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What a terrifying skill that utilizes fear to manipulate others! Be a good dog and live life safe and sound, that&rsquo;s what the skill is all about.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Later, Diablo mentions that he has been observing King Edmalis&rsquo; actions. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He seems to have satisfied all the conditions prepared by Diablo for him to step down. Right now there isn&rsquo;t even a need for Marquis M&uuml;ller and Earl Hermann to step in and hold people accountable as originally planned.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words, these people are all now royalists in aid of King Edmalis&hellip;&hellip; This initially seems to be deviating from our original plan, but as soon as one gets to the detail, one would realize that the situation now is far more ideal for the plan to proceed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis would step down and lead to the collapse of his authority. For this reason, the criticism would no doubt be directed to him and he will eventually be held accountable by the others. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The Royal Knight Order was massacred by Rimuru-sama, leaving the royal family unguarded. Right now, it is suicide for King Edmalis to stand against the nobles. He is left to his own devices. That is what seems to be happening, but in reality&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The Knight Order that protects the royal family is gone. The nobles wouldn&rsquo;t let go such a chance to make the King the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">scapegoat</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as Diablo describes, that seems to be the case.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A conflict is inevitable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The optimates may be planning to sacrifice King Edmais, but it seems that the King has realized this and has been fighting hard to avoid such fate.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">About this, what could happen next?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How would the royalists without any military to back themselves up avoid their defeat against the optimates?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Answer.

But if they could build him into a figure of their saviour, they could perform the fall of royal family, and their will to be carried forward by Youmu.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">King Edmalis is planning to get Youmu on their side, that means we would be on the same boat then.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m afraid it is just as you predict.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo delightfully smiles upon hearing my answer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Did I guess it right?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With us as their reinforcement, they would gain the military might greater than that of the Royal Knight Order. The nobles may boss around believing the king to be powerless, but they wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance against the hero Youmu.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, all we need to do is to send reinforcement for Youmu.

Very well then. By the way, are you back in Tempest because you finished your work in Farmus while I was at the Walpurgis Banquet?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I mention this to Diablo casually.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When I left at midnight, he was not present.

After issuing my threat to the King and the ministers, I went to different locations within Farmus to examine their financial status. I was trying to investigate whether there was any flaw in my plan. That is when Veldora-sama contacted me and summoned me back.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He just nonchalantly spilt out Veldora&rsquo;s secret.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With a &ldquo;Ga~Dong&rdquo; sound, Veldora rises up nervously from his seat.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I-I&rsquo;ve suddenly recalled something to attend to.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He is clearly trying to play dumb here, but you aren&rsquo;t getting away now.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ara ara, don&rsquo;t act so hastily now, Veldora-kun.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I lock my hand tightly on his shoulder with incredible speed.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 631.50px; height: 896.91px;"><img alt="" src="images/image19.png" style="width: 631.50px; height: 896.91px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">W-wait!

If I forgive him today, he may end up causing some other trouble in the future.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thankfully it was Diablo who responded to him, I can&rsquo;t even imagine how the other lieutenants would&rsquo;ve handled it. They would probably panic with Veldora&rsquo;s casual order to switch duty. That&rsquo;s exactly why I told Veldora to ask for my permission first before doing something like this again.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At the same time, there is only one more thing left for Diablo to attend to in person, that being the peace conference held in five days. He would be handling most of the details regarding the meeting, but he personally plans to continue the role as my butler.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is what Diablo has to say&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I am Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s butler after all, so I must accompany you at all times.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion is very sour over the fact, proving this to be Diablo&rsquo;s victory.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And about the peace conference.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh, should I attend as well?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No, I alone will be sufficient.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He rejected my proposal.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It would probably be more reassuring to have your boss with you when dealing with such important business. But perhaps such worry is unnecessary for someone as capable as Diablo.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Or rather, my presence would probably reduce the war-mongering sentiments among the nobles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although I&rsquo;m somewhat confused about this implication, things will be fine as long as Diablo is handling it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Upon thinking so, I can now safely take the great conquest of Farmus Kingdom off my mind.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Sometime later, things have gone just according to Diablo&rsquo;s prediction.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The nobles have gathered for the imperial conference.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Unlike the last meeting, the king and the ministers all look very serious as the tension overflows from their expression.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The nobles also sense the difference in atmosphere. Their expression also gradually becomes more tense without them noticing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The king starts the discussion:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Our troops marched on to destroy the Tempest Federation, yet they were decimated by the revived </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Veldora.

We&rsquo;ve been defeated.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is an impactful line that incited commotion throughout the room.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis begins to recount the horrific fate of the Farmus Army. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The content sounded unbelievable to the crowds, yet what the king said immediately after the account diverted their disbelief to criticism of the king.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is hardly unexpected.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Because the king announces that he has accepted the terms of the monsters to pay reparations for the war.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The amount of reparation is&mdash;&mdash;Ten thousand Star Gold Coins.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Impossible! A Star Gold Coin exchanges to a hundred gold coins.

Its existence is similar to a form of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Certificates for preservation</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">(D: or just another way of saying securities). A normal nation would probably own less than a hundred of them. No matter how strong Farmus Kingdom is, they could only collect around a thousand coins maximum, in addition to the more commonly used general coins (dwarven coins). Just as the nobles complained, it is an incredibly large amount for them to collect. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If the victors were their trade partners, Farmus could probably replace currency with commodities, but as a new kingdom run by monsters, they didn&rsquo;t have this option with tempest. Their economy would inevitably be affected.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo&rsquo;s intent was to make life difficult for them by demanding ten thousand coins, so it is no wonder that the nobles would complain about it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Besides, these nobles have not personally been on the battlefield themselves, so they lack a sense of urgency. They are not sharp enough to realize the crisis their nation is facing right now.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why many nobles begin to step out in opposition and argue for the continuation of the war against their enemy. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right.

Let&rsquo;s go fend off those monsters!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some even begin to spill such ridiculous claims shamelessly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The royalists feel somewhat shameful seeing how the nobles are acting. They begin to recall how themselves were acting when the king first informed them of the matter. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some start to fluster while sighing while others even begin their self-reflection upon imagining how the king must have felt at the time. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis is also well aware of what is really on the minds of the nobles gathered here. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Right now, all the nobles advocating for war are simply trying to protect their fortune. It is neither for the protection of Farmus Kingdom nor for the life and properties of the citizens. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They are simply putting out the words as if they are justified, while not harboring a real determination to fight the enemy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis has suspected this is how things will turn out. These are all landed nobles who have yet to recognize the reality of the situation.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These people have never experienced the taste of fear and don&rsquo;t have any intention of joining the frontline.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They just want to remain in safety while others fight their war. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They probably won&rsquo;t take responsibility either when they are defeated. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It may have worked in the past. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Because the Farmus Kingdom is a powerful nation that has oppressed surrounding nations in the past. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But that is not viable anymore. Such an old trick of issuing threats to neighbouring nations would no longer work. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Besides, their opponent is the Catastrophe-Ranked monster who is capable of decimating an entire army on its own&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Furious, the nobles start to loudly accuse the king for being responsible. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And claim that the reparations should be paid by the royal family.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And that the monsters&rsquo; demands must be rejected. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And that they should unite the Farmus military to take a last stand.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The nobles&rsquo; view, in a sense, is correct.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But they are forgetting an important factor.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That is the military force within Farmus Kingdom has been significantly reduced. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Or perhaps, they are simply unwilling to accept this reality&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With this reminded to them, some begin to quiet down with a tense look while some continue their unreasonable protest. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis&rsquo; worries have come true, the nobles can&rsquo;t reach an agreement and the meeting has been plunged into chaos.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At this moment, the head of the optimates&mdash;&mdash;the King&rsquo;s brother Edward speaks up with much preparation:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Brother, no, Your Highness! Even with you stepping down, you can&rsquo;t evade responsibility!

My dignity and glory are like trash to that tyrant! I don&rsquo;t want to be tormented by that horror anymore. Or perhaps, you wish to fight for this glory! I won&rsquo;t stop you! But, you would be sending the soldiers to die for a lost cause. </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No, about that&hellip;&hellip; But sire, if what you said is true, are you planning to run away on your own?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You fool, where could I run to!? That&rsquo;s why I want to step down and pay the reparations.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Edward believed that this is his best move to hold the king responsible, but he was confronted by King Edmalis&rsquo; rare display of verve and fell silent.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Seeing this, King Edmalis lowers his volume and continues:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">If I do not step down, we can only choose to be vassalized or continue the war. Is this really what we want? Our kingdom would be destroyed&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ehh&hellip;&hellip; but, you are asking us to surrender to the monsters without a fight&hellip;...</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Still unconvinced, Edward mumbles so rather unwillingly.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At this point, the meeting is quiet once more. Earl Hermann carefully opens up:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Could you hear me out? This morning, I received a letter containing very important information. I would like to deliver the message to you all.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Earl Hermann finishes and begins to announce the open letter sent by the Brumund Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The content of the letter is as follows, Brumund Kingdom officially supports Tempest Federation and would be sending military force to hold Farmus Kingdom accountable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is a real open letter in condemnation of Farmus Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">How dare a small nation like that be so arrogant!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">They must have been so arrogant because of our defeat, surely they would have remained silent if we had achieved victory.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet the anger of these nobles are quickly extinguished as they learn that Dwargon has made the same statement&mdash;&mdash;The Foreign Trade Minister adds on Hermann&rsquo; report. Now the nobles started to panic, their arrogant tones are also now toned down. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Brumund alone is enough, but if the Armed Nation Dwargon moves out, things will get difficult. Will the Dwarven King Gazel still remain neutral?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No, the problem is his influence and authority. Dwargon is also an important trade partner of ours, so nothing will end well with us angering King Gazel.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The report of Earl Hermann started the turn of atmosphere in the meeting room for the worse. But at that moment, someone dropped a bigger bomb.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">M-message for his majesty! Urgent news just arrived from the Freedom Association!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A soldier looking rather pale intruded into the room without the care of the important meeting ongoing. But the guards don&rsquo;t seem to be stopping him. The reason being the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Highest Urgency Report</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;on his hand.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The nobles would want to complain, but the word </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Highest</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have forced their words back to their mouth. This report is only issued for events with the threat level of Special Rank S, whoever impedes its delivery would be given the penalty of treason as by the combined law issued by Farmus Kingdom and Freedom Association.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Speak.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With King Edmalis&rsquo; permission, the soldier raises the report with his hands nervously shaking and begins to announce its content:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Monster Rimuru has proclaimed himself the ruler of Jura Great Forest.

Those Demon Lords won&rsquo;t sit this one out. That arrogant Rimuru would soon learn the horror of the real Demon Lords.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">If things go well, the Demon Lords may even take out the revived Veldora along the way too!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The nobles follow up the report as the herald is halfway through, but what he is about to say would vanquish their hopes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;Demon Lord Clayman was discontented and challenged Rimuru&mdash;&mdash;Demon Lord Rimuru, has allegedly eliminated him instead.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With the herald&rsquo;s words out, the shock experienced by everyone in the meeting room is unanimous. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;What!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">How can this be&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What about </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Lion King</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Karion? And </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Sky Queen</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Frey? What the hell are they up to? Are they seriously going to give away the rights to Jura Great Forest to a new-comer?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is only natural for them to be surprised learning their enemy has become a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One of the nobles followed up with a question about the responses of the other Demon Lords around Jura Great Forest. In response, the soldier finishes the last sentence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The Karion and Frey you mentioned, they&rsquo;ve given up their seat as Demon Lord to join the reign of Demon Lord Milim. The constituent of Demon Lords is thus altered as well, the now eight Demon Lords in total are called </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Eight-Star Demon Lords</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">! </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This line completely silenced all of the optimates.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve probably learnt that their arch nemesis Rimuru is also one of the Eight-Star Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The royalists have already caught wind of the news prior to the meeting, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;ve accepted it willingly simply for knowing earlier. They again fell silent given how unbelievable it sounds no matter how many times they hear the news.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This information was sent out by the Demon Lords&rsquo; side alone. Since there is no point in doubting the authenticity. Each Demon Lord possesses enormous strength to exempt them from the need to deceive the humans with such matters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The meeting room is clouded by silence before King Edmalis decides to open up after hardened consideration:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">As you&rsquo;ve heard, everyone. Veldora may be a great threat, but this monster called Rimuru is equally a dangerous character. He is a monster</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;beyond our imagination to have beaten Demon Lord Clayman so easily. Is there still a need to continue this meeting? My will to step down has been determined. It is simply too foolish to talk all high and mighty of how we are for the nation without even considering the capabilities of our enemy. I&rsquo;ve been blinded by profits; it was my mistake. Had we chosen another approach to interact with them, they might have been a good neighbour of ours.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis implies that his abdication would likely lead to a new relationship between the two nations. The nobles realize there isn&rsquo;t a point opposing the proposal at this point as they carefully follow the king&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone finally decides to accept reality and follows through with King Edmalis&rsquo; proposal, the only viable way.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m stepping down. In addition, I&rsquo;m recommending Edward to inherit the throne.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Brother&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What did you say!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Aren&rsquo;t you passing the throne to Prince Edgar?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The king&rsquo;s unexpected words have caused a commotion in the room again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone thinks that as soon as King Edmalis steps down, the throne would be naturally passed onto the prince. That&rsquo;s why Edward has been trying hard in highlighting himself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His brother Edmalis would have to step down. Facing such rare opportunity, Edward dreams to take the throne for his own. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even if Prince Edgar inherits the crown this time, there is still a chance as long as he affirms his authority. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The prince is only ten years old. But with his father still alive and well, Edward wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take control behind the scenes yet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If that is the case, he plans to spark discontent among the nobles so they think in the direction of&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Lord Edward is the proper candidate for the throne.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But now, the throne is Edward&rsquo;s to take.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">There are still many challenges ahead of us. Edgar is still too young to conquer them properly.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis says so rather bitterly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The ministers all hold different views, whereas some nods in agreement with this decision.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">My liege, I think this is a great idea.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is Marquis M&uuml;ller.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hearing this, Edward laughs internally. Now this decision is likely hammered down since he has even got the approval from Marquis M&uuml;ller, who is the head of the centrists. He is confident in his ability to overcome the challenges as soon as he has the throne. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They would make excuses to delay the reparation payment while roping the neighbouring countries into battle against the monster kingdom. Just as the nobles from his faction claimed, the human alliance with Chosen Hero and Holy Knights as back-up would nonetheless be an effective deterrence. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Besides, they may even be unnecessary&hellip;&hellip;.. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With the exchange of kingship, it would also mean the exchange of political power.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The demands accepted by the previous government is not required to be fulfilled up by the new government. This would mean there is no need to pay for the ridiculously high reparation. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If anyone is getting punished for it, he would push all the blames to the previous king&mdash;&mdash;his own brother Edmalis.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Edward&rsquo;s thoughts are rather shallow.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Hehehe, I will definitely make the nation more prosperous as soon as I become the king.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Unaware of the his orchestrated role in this grander play, Edward is overjoyed by the prospect of inheriting the throne.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The meeting proceeded smoothly afterwards. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Many questions were addressed with detailed solutions. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They were able to outline a general plan and come to a unanimous agreement on engaging in peace conference with the monsters.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;The scene moves on to the location of the peace conference. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The great and ancient kingdom of Farmus agrees and signs the treaty of truce with Jura Tempest Federation. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The two reach a common ground. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In effect, The Kingdom of Farmus is recognizing the legitimacy of the Tempest Federation as a country, even though they can&rsquo;t bypass international law nor having not established diplomatic tie.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But with that being said, the Tempest Federation has yet to join the council formed by the Western Nations&mdash;&mdash;the Western State Council. So even if Farmus were to commence another invasive attack, there will be no judicial intervention. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is only from a humanitarian point of view that Farmus has recognized the status of Tempest Federation among different nations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But, it has been proven that Tempest Federation possesses military strength.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The ruler of that nation is the new Demon Lord Rimuru. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">An ally of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Veldora, and a monster beyond their comprehension to have dominated the Jura Great Forest in less than two years&rsquo; time. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The facts are all listed right in front of them, so no nation would dare to start a war against Tempest Federation. Rather than profits, they think the losses alone would be too much. Moreover, acting too rashly may even lead to the destruction of their nations.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">From that day onward&mdash;&mdash;Rimuru has become an existence that no one dares to obstruct. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He has become a Demon Lord of this world, a Catastrophe-Ranked threat. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And phase one concludes without any major issue. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everything is unfolding according to Diablo&rsquo;s plan&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 630.11px; height: 874.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image23.png" style="width: 630.11px; height: 874.50px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.3rdcrjn"></a><h2 class="c47" id="h.26in1rg"><span class="c16 c1">Chapter 2</span></h2><p class="c22"><span class="c23 c1">Each&#39;s Duty</span></p><hr><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The day after Diablo&rsquo;s report, Shuna and Souei returned early in the morning.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">We&rsquo;ve made it back safely!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Shuna said so while rubbing me against her cheek.

However, Hakurou treats Shuna as preciously as he would to a granddaughter, so he probably wouldn&rsquo;t mind if she&rsquo;s the one asking for a favor.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It seems that he&rsquo;s been assisting Geld in coordinating the investigation of Clayman&rsquo;s castle, the recovery of trophies, and the management of captives. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s a lot on Hakurou&rsquo;s shoulders&mdash;&mdash;I feel deeply grateful to him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His work is piling up, but a layman like myself would just get in the way. I should stay quiet until he makes a request (for assistance).</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The following night, Benimaru&rsquo;s party also returned. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh?

That guy got along quite well with Milim-sama&rsquo;s subordinate Midley, so he decided to help with the wrap-up.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I see. So Geld is at Clayman&rsquo;s base, while Gabil remains on the battlefield.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I see that Gabil has also stayed to deal with the aftermath. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Whether it is Geld or Gabil, both seem very reliable when tackling real situations.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The war is not over although the battle is won.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The aftermath is more problematic to deal with. Especially since we&rsquo;ve wiped out all of Clayman&rsquo;s underlings&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We have profited from the hard labor of the many captives taken from the battlefield and his base. Since we&rsquo;ve promised to spare their lives, we need to take responsibility in taking care of them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They are all Majins, so unlike humans, they could probably put up with harsher treatment. But they would still hold a grudge if they aren&rsquo;t provided basic welfare. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Resentment due to their defeat in war on the other hand, couldn&rsquo;t be helped. But the aftermath would have to be handled by the victorious side&hellip;... </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It would be quite tiresome to teleport all of the captives on the battlefield at once, so we have to be careful not to let any of them start an insurgency when we are not looking. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These Majins are concerning even when disarmed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When one considers the magic and skills in this world, it&rsquo;s no wonder no one dares to take captives.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ve got to come up with a way to prevent insurgency&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oh, don&rsquo;t worry about that. I&#39;ve gathered all the captives and explained the matter with all of them.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">O-okay.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I found myself subconsciously lowering my head upon seeing Benimaru&rsquo;s delightful smile </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I intentionally avoided asking what he said to them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some captives have probably already seen how Benimaru incinerated Charybdis. No one would dare to rebel so long as the message is spread.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Besides, there are the Beastketeers. So I&rsquo;ll leave the matter of managing captives to the Beastmen.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I presume then Gabil won&rsquo;t be back for now?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Unlikely. He can&rsquo;t use </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Dimensional Transportation</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">, so he would probably return with the Beastketeers.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I was just thinking that Gabil&rsquo;s party would fly back promptly after everything was settled. Putting that aside for now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh? Are the Beastketeers coming as well?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why would the Beastketeers come? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Are they returning with the rescued civilians, disarmed captives, and everyone else altogether?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Please consider this, hasn&rsquo;t the capital of Yuurazania been wiped out by Milim-sama? So they decided in the end to join our reign for the time being.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Benimaru told me that the Beastmen are an energetic species, so it won&rsquo;t be a problem for them to travel long distances by marching.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But that is not what I intended to ask&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But can we even accommodate all those people?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Last time we took in twenty-thousand people it took quite a while to clear out an area for camping alone. Moreover, both Geld (who is a highly reliable man) and the orc tribe construction team are on a business trip. Even if there is additional space in the area we have explored, it will still be challenging to provide everyone with a place to reside.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">About that, I&rsquo;ve discussed with Geld and Alvis. We&rsquo;ve organized the captives into several major brigades to seek residence in different locations.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Benimaru explains, telling me to not worry.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They seem to have filtered the members to shelter. (beastmen)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Those who have a village to return to will take care of themselves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As for those coming to Tempest Federation, they all seem to be Beastmen wishing to learn about our technologies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Beastmen who have stamina remaining will stay at the battlefield, along with the Majins, to follow the orders of Geld&rsquo;s troops. Under their command, they will construct on the ruins of the now wiped out Yuurazania. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Karion has renounced his title of Demon Lord and become Milim&rsquo;s subordinate, meaning Yuurazania has also become Milim&rsquo;s territory. There is a field of fertile land south of the Jura Great Forest, in the middle of Yuurazania. It is likely going to be the construction ground for Milim&rsquo;s new city.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shouldn&rsquo;t you just move your city altogether if you will have to rebuild it? I suggested to Milim after the idea sparked in my mind, and she agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And I thought we needed more time to discuss&hellip;&hellip;. Well, it&rsquo;s Milim we are talking about after all. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s very quick to make such decisions. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Come to think about it, Milim doesn&rsquo;t have any actual subordinates. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Worshipers of Dragons may seem to be her subordinates, but in reality, they only worship Milim; they are not under her command. Considering that, moving the capital would be needless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Still, there&rsquo;s no problem with it&mdash;&mdash;Karion and Frey don&rsquo;t seem to object either, so we can build up new cities without any hindrance, financed by Clayman&rsquo;s treasure troves we collected. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In addition, we have the captives (who are getting split into groups at the moment) to supply the labor force. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is no need for me to worry since Benimaru and Geld seem to have personally visited the sites to oversee the operation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Their growth has been astonishing. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I recall my junior Tamura who never seemed to be able to follow my guidance despite repeated instruction&mdash;&mdash;now even monsters are doing a better job than you!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">According to Benimaru, Tempest Federation will be receiving less people this time around. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, does it mean we don&rsquo;t need to provide new temporary residences for them?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes, there shouldn&#39;t be a need. But there are more than just Beastmen due to the Majin captives. We&rsquo;d better clarify this to everyone else, and just in case I&rsquo;ll inform everyone to tighten up security.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Alright. I understand, I&rsquo;ll explain it to everyone.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rigurdo nods in response to Benimaru&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These two have become really capable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They are able to carry out their own decisions even without my guidance. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Eh? Does that mean they would be fine even without me? That makes me feel somewhat lonely. :(</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s been several days since Benimaru&rsquo;s party returned.

After some inquiry, I also learnt that it is still a mystery whether the total Star Gold Coins in circulation in this world even adds up to ten thousands. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Here&rsquo;s what their producer, King Gazel has to say: </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The Star Gold Coin can only be produced once a month. I&rsquo;ve heard that since the creation of our nation, there has been some periods when no Star Gold Coin at all is produced. That&rsquo;s why its rarity makes for its value.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It is rumored that the amount of gold coins circulating is hundreds of times more than the Star Gold Coins, so it is undoubtedly rare indeed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And here before my eyes are fifteen hundred pieces of said rare Star Gold Coins. I can only be amazed at the thought that more than ten percent of all the Star Gold Coins in circulation are all gathered here.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">As expected from a powerful nation such as Farmus, they were actually able to gather so many of them.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You can have a peek into their national reserve from the enormous amount of coins they are able to prepare.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It is certainly impressive, however most of them came from King Edmalis. He has made up this amount from his own treasury.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">According to Diablo, most of these Star Gold Coins belong to the royal treasury and have lost their luster without much use. They have the Dwarven Kingdom to back them up economically by providing a means to convert the royal treasures with much artistic values to monetary funds.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Now that the Knight Order who is supposed to protect the royal family is gone, it would undoubtedly be robbed clean by the nobles&mdash;&mdash; King Edmalis naturally understood as much.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Is that why he decided to hand over all his assets to clear the national reserves?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I see&hellip;... Eh, won&rsquo;t they be fighting each other then as planned?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes, that would definitely be the case. I doubt the new king would accept having the rest of the debts be kept in forms of ledger.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo-kun laughs in response.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He has set his eyes on the long run by considering the mind of the new king. That&rsquo;s probably why he chose the King&rsquo;s brother Edward to inherit the throne instead of prince Edgar.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis has also accepted that this is the only solution available to them now. Normally, Edmalis would receive the treatment of a Duke, but he has refused it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He gave away his crown and became a viscount. He has now moved to the small rural land near the territory of Earl Nedler McMunn.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">From everyone else&rsquo;s viewpoint, Edmalis has completely given up his ambition for power.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With that being the case&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Answer. The other factions who don&rsquo;t wish to take on the responsibility of repaying the remaining reparations would likely try to pin the rest of the responsibility on Edmalis.</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Of course. It seems that everything is going according to Diablo&rsquo;s plan.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Youmu must have used Nedler&rsquo;s territory as his base so you can travel there with ease as soon as anything occurs.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed, just as you have deduced.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo nods with a smile on his face.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion looked pissed listening to our conversation. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No, it&rsquo;s probably going in one ear and out the other. She must have given up thinking halfway through our conversation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Eh, I&rsquo;ll worry about Shion later.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hmm hmm. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nedler&#39;s territory directly borders the Jura Great Forest. It is a middle-scale land near the border with a branch of the Freedom Association. Riots often break out, owing to the sheer number of people residing there. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s where Youmu is staying. His heroic deeds are known by many, and as such, he is very popular among the people. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Would Youmu stop the him even if the new king tries to sacrifice Edmalis?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes. We will have Youmu-san accuse the new king for being dishonest in the deal. There would definitely be a riot by that time.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Is he trying to create a spontaneous confrontation by having Youmu protect Edmalis and his acquaintances?</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What a perfect plan.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If the new king is willing to pay the rest of the reparations, we won&rsquo;t hold them further accountable, but we&rsquo;d better have our eyes set on the long run and plan out the slow disintegration of the Farmus Kingdom. However, even I can&rsquo;t fully fathom Diablo&rsquo;s strategy. His skillful manipulation will lead to ideal results.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Change is coming, and soon. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The new king would most likely take actions to eliminate Edmalis. Our plan would fall apart if the new king managed to take control of Edmalis. But of course, we can always ignore whatever they bring up, even if it would be at the cost of our international reputation </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Whatever you do needs to be justified&mdash;&mdash; That&rsquo;s the rule of human society.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You must remain vigilant! Could the people manipulating the new king minimize the damage to the people?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">If you wish so, I, Diablo, shall deliver to your expectations.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You are truly talented. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He is a bit too smart, so much so that it is almost intimidating. But it seems Diablo can accomplish anything handed to him. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll leave the rest to you. If the military funds ever run low, you can always use these Star Gold Coins.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I store a thousand of the Star Gold Coins in my </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Stomach</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and hand over the remaining five hundred to Diablo.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Luckily, everyone was revived, so we only need to compensate them individually. Considering all the reparations, we have to use them to the fullest even with only a thousand coins claimed. We&rsquo;ve gained plenty of treasure from Clayman&rsquo;s base to fill in a wealthy treasury. Although city development may cost a lot of money in the future, we still have enough of a budget to support Youmu.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Based on all this, I gave Diablo the suggestion of supporting him. However, he turned me down with a smile. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Rimuru-sama, knowing your heart is there alone is delightful to me. But there is no such need. Our forces will be sufficient with how everything is set up. Or perhaps you would grant me the honor of joining the battle&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ah, no can do. I&rsquo;ll prepare some extra forces, but you have to lay low yourself.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I said, cutting Diablo off midway.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I know best how strong Diablo truly is so I won&rsquo;t be stupid enough to misuse such power. Unless they encounter enemies at the level of Holy Knights, his power is simply too excessive (wasteful) to be used on an average human nation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Doing so will only alienate the humans due to fear, and thus achieving mutual understanding will more difficult. We are walking on thin ice towards my goal of peaceful coexistence with the human societies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Other than that, there is no issue with troop deployment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Right now, no one would dare to go toe-to-toe against us publicly. Geld&rsquo;s troops may have been sent to deal with construction work, but the military might of Benimaru&rsquo;s troops alone would be more than enough. Besides, Farmus these days has lost more than half of its military reserves and would not pose any threat against us. Knowing that, I just need to prepare some reinforcement troops first. The money can be invested in building Youmu&rsquo;s new kingdom in the future.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Understood. I shall stay low and completely veil myself behind the scene.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo immediately responds upon hearing my explanation</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Shion, you should learn more from Diablo.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But why! I&rsquo;ve always stayed calm and followed through with your orders!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">While I often remind her of her shortcomings, Shion seems to lack self-awareness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Seriously.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I could only hope that she begins to realize things for herself and be more composed.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sigh. There&rsquo;s still a long way to go before I can send Shion off on a solo mission. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After the report, Diablo suddenly recalled something and decided to ask me a question.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Rimuru-sama, the Western Saints Church is trying to establish contact with my subordinate Rayheim. They seem to be summoning him in hope of uncovering the details of our battle against the Farmus Kingdom&hellip;&hellip;. What&rsquo;s your view on the matter?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This Mister Rayheim is the archbishop of Farmus Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Right now he seems to have become Diablo&rsquo;s loyal lackey, but it would also pose an issue if he ignores his summoning. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hmm&mdash;&mdash;It would also be problematic if we just leave things as is.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed, I suggest we send him to do some explaining, just to investigate what the Church is planning.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right&hellip;&hellip; There were only three survivors, it is natural that the church would want to hear his story.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Of the survivors: previous King of Farmus Edmalis, Head of Court Mages Larzen, and Archbishop Rayheim, it is obvious they would pick their own Archbishop for questioning. Or perhaps, Rayheim is their only candidate.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It may be a fact that Veldora has indeed been revived, but the timing does not align with our narrative. The Western Saints Church seem to be surveilling Veldora all these times, our story may be exposed if that&rsquo;s the case&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is that so&hellip;. Then, should we let him tell the truth?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I begin to ponder. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It may pose a hindrance to our plan depending on how the Western Saints Church acts. It would be best if we could steer clear from them, but their hostile doctrine in regard to &nbsp;monsters is truly troublesome.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I want our relationship to be like that between the Church and the Kingdom of Dwargon. The two are not on good terms since the dwarves treat monsters equally, which conflicts with the doctrine of the church. But they didn&rsquo;t become become hostile, instead both simply ignore each other. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We must aim for this relationship as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I have no intention to deny such religious doctrines that have existed over thousands of years, but with that being said, we can&rsquo;t simply just accept their demands. Surely when they proclaim </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">All monsters deserve to die</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, you can&rsquo;t just simply comply by saying </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re right</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. We must respect and understand each other. War would be inevitable if one side could not accept the other&rsquo;s views. For this reason, it is essential that we compromise and try to stay away from potential sources of conflict.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although even with that being said, it will still require their cooperation. If they don&rsquo;t have the same idea in mind, it would be just us trying this out alone. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If the Western Saints Church consider us as the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Nemesis of God</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, then unfortunately we will have to put up a fight. If things turn out that way, then it leaves us no choice but the destroy them without mercy. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But right now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Alright, then we&rsquo;ll try to send out a message first. Didn&rsquo;t we acquire some video recording magic items from Clayman? Let&rsquo;s put some of my messages in and see how they would react when Rayheim brings it to probe the reaction of the Saints Church.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Understood.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes sir! I&rsquo;ll go prepare now.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo nods as he receives my order while Shion runs off to find the crystal ball. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo reported to me later that he had sent Rayheim out. A few more days have passed since then. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although the man has been sent, there hasn&rsquo;t been any response from the Western Saints Church. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There seems to be a commotion on their end.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But it can&rsquo;t really be helped.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After all, both Veldora was revived and a new Demon Lord was born&mdash;&mdash;AKA me. They probably won&rsquo;t be able to decide how to deal with us so fast. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It won&rsquo;t matter either if they continue to ignore us. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll put it on hold and observe for now before they reply.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Beastketeers arrived. Including the captives, the group consisting of tens of thousands of people arrived earlier than I expected.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Beastmen and Majins are indeed impressive. Going by stamina alone, they are already far superior to humans. Moreover, since magic is real in this world, they can rely on magic when they run out of stamina and get back on their feet when their mana is depleted. Due to this, they are able to march much more efficiently and quickly. What impressed me more is that even the civilians are able to apply such a method. As expected from the defiant Beastmen. But I haven&rsquo;t yet seen Gabil; he must be somewhere at the rear of all those troops </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My thoughts were interrupted by the greetings of the Beastketeers Alvis and Suphia. I greet them back only to realize that one of them is missing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh? Didn&rsquo;t Phobio come as well?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">About that, Phobio stayed back to keep an eye on the Majin captives.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Suphia answers. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">While Geld was staying at Clayman&rsquo;s base, he asked Phobio to keep an eye on the Majins in case of an insurgency. In other words, he&rsquo;s been stuck with the chore work. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Phobio-kun, RIP. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But in all honesty, surveillance is still necessary even with Benimaru&rsquo;s warning. I appreciate Phobio&rsquo;s self-sacrifice in taking on the tasks from the bottom of my heart &nbsp;On another note, the arrangements for their residence are complete due to Rigurdo&rsquo;s leadership.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Additionally, the allocation of work has been prepared as well. Rigurdo has been talking to the managers of the production department, namely Kaijin and Kurobei to see how many spots are available for each department. Those who came here are people with a passion to learn technology, but sadly we can only accept limited members. That&rsquo;s why we would be rotating the position within these departments for the people joining. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, we should try open up classrooms for cultivating professional personnel. Perhaps it would be a good idea to build a school to pass on these techniques.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Our shelter operation slowly unfolds as these ideas cross my mind.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As Alvis&rsquo; party enters the town, I see Gabil at the rear of the troops.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Rimuru-sama, I&rsquo;m back!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He exclaims without a hint of fatigue as he descends from the sky. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oh, good job out there! I heard you were quite active on the battlefield.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s not the case, I was far from being good. Milim-sama&rsquo;s subordinate Midley-san blasted me hard with lightning.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oh, Benimaru did mention to me that those people are extremely powerful dragonoids. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right, since they worship Milim, it is no wonder that they are war-mongers as well. Is your recent evolution the reason why you haven&rsquo;t been able to achieve your full potential? You still have a long way to go.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m not sure whether my words are comforting him or not, but I said them nonetheless. He doesn&rsquo;t seem quite upset by it. I&rsquo;m sure Gabil must also be thinking the same thing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes!

Suddenly, &nbsp;Gabil takes out a letter and presents it to me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What is this?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a letter from Milim-sama. She told me to deliver it to Rimuru-sama&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What is this? There seems to be an ominous aura around it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She did mention she will drop by to play with me after I parted ways with her at the Walpurgis Banquet&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As I open the letter, I lay my eyes on the exotic and charming writings (horribly written non-sensible symbols)&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">This is Milim! Next time I visit to play with you, I&rsquo;ll bring a couple of guys who like taking care of me along! I hope you teach them the true meaning of gourmet food. This is my request of a lifetime for my bestie. Please help me, pleeeeease!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 856.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image21.png" style="width: 602.00px; height: 856.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Those are the words written on the letter, though one can tell the effort she put into it due to the sincerity of her writing. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If anyone likes taking care of Milim, it would be the Worshippers of Dragon, right?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s this is supposed to mean, have you heard anything about it?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes, a little bit. I became quite the close acquaintance with Hermann-san from the Worshippers of Dragon and was able to get some inside news from him&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">According to Gabil, this Hermann seems to be a rather reasonable man unlike the warmongering Midley. He is a free-spirited fellow who has even travelled to Dwargon and the Western Nations. Hermann told Gabil that the Worshippers of Dragons have a very simple lifestyle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why they believe that there is no need to pay too much attention in moderating Milim-sama&rsquo;s diet. Perhaps they are like our tribe who consider food such as raw fish as the best type of cuisine&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gabil claims so, but I think the two may be different.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Lizardmen tribe are more suited to consuming raw fish due to their taste buds. They also utilize methods such as smoking to flavor the food, so they are not completely ignorant of culinary techniques. They are also capable of other basic culinary skills and can produce some simple, non-fish foods. In contrast, the Worshippers of Dragon seem to lack the common sense of diet moderation. Although they wouldn&rsquo;t go as far as eating raw meat, I feel that they only refrain from it in order to avoid food poisoning. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">........ I see. Are the taste buds of dragonewts the same as humans&rsquo;?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes. Thanks to my evolution, I&rsquo;ve gained a variety of new taste sensations. Now dining has become a great joy for me considering how tasteless most food was in the past!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right? That&rsquo;s how one gets addicted to good food. Tasty food gives you the urge to eat more.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gabil nods dramatically upon hearing and agreeing with my views.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I see, so that&rsquo;s how it is! Perhaps Hermann-san meant that he wishes that such customs would enter their life as well!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gabil may have a point.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Whether what we do can be considered as custom is to be determined, but I have an idea about what Milim&rsquo;s request is. It is rather contradictory to worship Milim as a god while ignoring said god&rsquo;s will. Why Milim did not complain about these things is beyond me&hellip;&hellip; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Perhaps Milim is pretty conscientious after all. Maybe she knew that they are doing everything for her sake out of good will. That&rsquo;s why she didn&rsquo;t complain and kept playing along.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, we shall treat her to a feast during her next visit.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes! What a great idea!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We must get the point across with subtlety without outright rejecting the worshippers&rsquo; way of life by creating a scenario for them to realize by themselves how to make Milim happier. This task seems to be harder than I imagined. Perhaps I should seek others&rsquo; opinions on the matter during a meeting on another day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I tell Gabil to return to the cave and continue his research. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nowadays even with Vesta&rsquo;s aid, there are still too few researchers. Their work would be even harder without Gabil&rsquo;s party.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Then, I shall depart first.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right.

Good job out there.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">(D: Rimuru seems to be surprised at his return)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I greet him out of reflex. Geld glances at me and opens up after taking a deep breath:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve once again experienced the greatness of Rimuru-sama.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What do you mean by that all of a sudden?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I couldn&rsquo;t help but ask after he blurted out those words with a serious expression. Those tired eyes of his seemed to gleam with a genuine sense of respect.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I haven&rsquo;t been doing anything lately, so I don&rsquo;t quite recall doing anything worthy of someone else&rsquo;s respect. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I wonder what he has gone through the past few weeks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ah, it&rsquo;s really nothing, but here&rsquo;s the story&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Geld begins to vividly recount the past events, although most of them were just filled with complaints about the new recruits. He allocated the captives into different groups and arranged them into different regiments. So far, nothing seemed off yet. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But when Geld commanded them to conduct site measurements and preparations&hellip;&hellip;. That&rsquo;s when the questions started popping up. Since the orcs are able to communicate through </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Telepathy Net</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with their tribesman, they can carry out work easily without verbal communication. However, this method is not applicable to the groups of Majins newly mixed into the regiments. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even with verbal explanations, the Majins don&rsquo;t seem to understand. But it is fundamentally due to the fact that most of Geld&rsquo;s subordinates, including himself as the worst offender, are horrible at communication. These orcs are more like craftsmen who don&rsquo;t know how to explain things in a clear and orderly manner. Having the Orcs give instructions resulted in a nightmare of low efficiency when the construction actually started. Everyone was overworked and filled with anger and resentment at the situation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Those Majins also seem to be rather uncooperative in regards to taking orders. Even when Geld&rsquo;s men gave physical demonstrations of how to do the work, many of the Majins still refused to comply. &nbsp;Besides, even those who are willing to work have yet to master the techniques, leading to disappointing results... </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I suppose that&rsquo;s true. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Things are hardly easier with more people. &nbsp;The surplus of workers would mean nothing if none of them knew what they were doing. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why professional training is really important.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;Let me demonstrate it for you, let me teach it to you; I will let you try it and I will compliment you for your effort.

I believe every leader should keep this quote dear to heart. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The hardship of the education and upbringing of subordinates are all in this quote. Moreover, one would only feel proud for their work if they realize the purpose of their work. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hearing Geld&rsquo;s complaints brings back memories of my salaryman days. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Operators</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;who ignored my instructions;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Juniors who tried to hide their failure; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Bosses who tried to push their responsibilities to other people. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My last life was not easy either. Although there were indeed happy memories, it would take until the end of the time for me to finish spitting out all my complaints. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Whenever I feel this way, I always&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right, let&rsquo;s go grab a drink! Let&rsquo;s not leave before getting drunk today, Geld!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I said so while patting Geld on the shoulder, inviting him out for a drink. Drinking and having someone to chat with is the best solution to this type of situation. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Helping subordinates destress is also part of my duty as a leader, and improving their mood after they complain is another part of it. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I should definitely spend more time on people like Geld who have a great sense of responsibility.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We drank for the whole night while Geld showered me with his complaints. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Early on next morning, I gathered all the lieutenants to have a meeting. But before that, I went to visit Hakurou. Since I only reached Hakurou through </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Telepathy Net</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;last night, I decided to give him a personal welcome back first thing in the morning.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t believe Rimuru-sama would come receive me in person&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He seems very grateful having received such a privilege </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hakurou doesn&rsquo;t seem as tired as Geld.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Good job out there.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You are too kind, I have hardly done anything worthy of such praise.. There wasn&rsquo;t really much I could do since all the captives have already been accounted for. Compared to me, Geld is the one that truly worked hard. There is no longer a need for me to return since I&rsquo;ve transferred all my work to the others last night &hellip;&hellip;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Geld&hellip;&hellip; He really did work hard. I&rsquo;ve been drinking with him ever since I contacted you last night. He seems really troubled. In the past, he could always put his heart to work without being distracted, but it seems that commanding the captives has really taken a toll on him.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed.

The easiest way to discipline the Majins, who all have different interpretation of the situation, is through violent oppression. Granted, violent oppression would probably not bring about the best results since the end result is likely the product of some form of forced compromise. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Geld, as a professional craftsman, probably would not tolerate such unimpressive results. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Speaking of which, Rimuru-sama, there is something I wish to report.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">I&rsquo;ll leave Geld&rsquo;s problem to his own concerns</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash; Perhaps that was the conclusion Hakurous reached as he opened up to me with something unrelated.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What is it?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Well, regarding Clayman&rsquo;s territory of the Puppet State Jistav, most of the denizens there seem to be slaves. There are no other races besides Dark Elves residing there. Most of them have roles related to the management of the castle, with a total of more than one thousand of them expressing a desire to serve us. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hmm, and?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">About that&hellip;....

It&rsquo;s no good to rush things in one go.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For that reason, I decided it was best to approach the matter of the ancient ruins cautiously. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone has now gathered at the large meeting room. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Taking the initiative, I open up to speak to commence the meeting. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ahem&mdash;&mdash; Everyone. Some of you may already be aware, but I am now officially a Demon Lord!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I announce so while sitting in my special slime chair and taking a glance around. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Congratulations!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone floods me with their best wishes with smiles on their faces, even the ones who already knew. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hmm, hmm, the sensation of overcoming a huge challenge truly is delightful.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You&rsquo;ve finally gained your rightful position after so long!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Amazing. I&rsquo;m so moved that you&rsquo;ve really become a real Demon Lord.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Would this be the start of Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s reign!?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rigurdo&hellip;. You say you&rsquo;ve been waiting for so long, yet you and I haven&rsquo;t even known each other for more than two years.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How much has this guy overestimated my abilities&hellip;&hellip;..?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rigurdo seems to be moved to tears unlike Shion who looks very proud instead. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even I feel quite moved by it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And if there is any problem remaining, it would be the reaction from the Western Saints Church. It would create the most ideal environment for our nation if this problem could be resolved. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Jovially, I continue with the agenda of the meeting. I have to inform everyone of the decisions made during the Walpurgis Banquet as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right, I haven&rsquo;t brought this up before, but it&rsquo;s been decided that my territory would include the entirety of the Jura Great Forest. Right now, I&rsquo;ve been officially titled as the ruler. Any objections? But anyhow, I don&rsquo;t think there would be a problem anyways. But we need to defend ourselves should anyone invade. Moreover, how should we inform the outside world which territories are my domain? Is it okay for us to just leave it like this?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My lieutenants seemed to become increasingly nervous the more I spoke. Some of their faces even sprouting looks of tension. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Eh? Is something amiss?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">About that&hellip;&hellip; do you mean the entire forest? Is it true?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rigurdo ventures.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Y-yeah.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I give the confirmation. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oi oi, is this for real. Does this include the entire forest including the banks across the river?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Benimaru asks, to which my response was </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Probably.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With regards to the aforementioned river, he must be referring to the Great River of Amedo. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The other side of the river bank is territory under the control of the Eastern Empire, so unfortunately we are not very familiar with it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is there a problem?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It won&rsquo;t be a huge problem for us, but I recall that the opposite bank of the river is not under the administration of the Dryads. And since only the residents within the Dryads&rsquo; territory consider Rimuru-sama as their leader, the residents opposite to the bank must be having headaches over the emergence of the new Demon Lord.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Benimaru answers thoughtfully.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It doesn&rsquo;t sound that bad. He seems to be implying (with a smirk) that </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">If they dare to protest, we will just annihilate them.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hold on a sec this is actually a </span><span class="c21">HUGE</span><span class="c1 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">problem! </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ehh, that&rsquo;s really something. Does this mean that all the Demon Lords recognize that all of the resources in this forest now belong to Rimuru-sama? In other words, the collection of resources would all be under Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s control. That&rsquo;s an impressive scale of operation!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Kaijin exclaims excitingly, seeming to speak what was on my mind.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s exactly the case. Although, I seem to have the nagging suspicion that things may get out of hand big time. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">According to Kaijin, all of our mining operations have been underground (illegal) and everyone is in on it. The Dryad Overseers of the forest for the most part kept their eyes closed, rendering the entire area essentially lawless. It&rsquo;s a common sight to see people in and out of Dwargon collect and exploit the forest resources for profit. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This has been the norm since there wasn&rsquo;t a need to ask for permission from anyone. But from now on, they would need my permission for entering and residing within the forest&hellip;&hellip; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Right now all the denizens of the forest would need to be granted my permission to reside.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh? If that&rsquo;s the case, would there be more people coming as time moves on?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes. Since Rimuru-sama has officially become a Demon Lord, those who aren&rsquo;t coming to greet you would practically be sending an open declaration of war.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shuna explains with a gentle smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It can&rsquo;t be wrong if even Shuna says so. But upon considering so, those residents who were previously living a carefree life in the forest suddenly need to get my permission. It is troublesome no matter how you put it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But, isn&rsquo;t it too late to bring it up now? They&rsquo;ve already been living in&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rigurdo and Gabil respond upon hearing my mutterings.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You shouldn&rsquo;t put it that way. The Demon Lords possess immense power. As for Goblins, even the power of a Greater Majin is already beyond our imagination.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed, that&rsquo;s exactly the case. Although the choice to decide whether to submit to Demon Lords and live under their protection or live a carefree life denying their authority is up to each individual, even us Lizard-men have to choose the former. No one would stand opposing Demon Lords. Only fools would ignore their presence. That&rsquo;s why we normally send our greetings first in order to prevent antagonizing them.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As Shuna mentioned before, those who aren&rsquo;t willing to greet the Demon Lords would likely be labeled as rebels. It is said that Demon Lords will send their subordinates to annihilate said rebels if they deem their actions severe enough. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Eh, I&rsquo;m not the type to rain destruction on others over such trivial matters. But the monsters who haven&rsquo;t personally met me would probably not get the same impression&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But hey, at least the Lizard-men would be present to send their regards. I&rsquo;ve already informed my father of Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s great deeds in becoming a Demon Lord!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gabil confidently announces. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Eh, when did you decide on that?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is Abil-san visiting?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes! I&rsquo;ve told Shion-san as well, my dad said he would definitely come greet Rimuru-sama in person.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Things seem to be getting wilder.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Lizardmen are considered a major tribe within the Jura Great Forest. &nbsp;Such a major tribe&rsquo;s decision to greet me would inevitably pressure the weaker ones to greet me as well. Those who know me would probably be delighted to visit, while those who don&rsquo;t know me would most likely shit their pants at the notion alone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They would probably only be thinking about how screwed they would be if they offended their new overlord. Perhaps, I should come up with a way for everyone to conduct the greeting ceremony in a more relaxed manner to avoid scaring them too much. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But those are just my thoughts &hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I turn to Shion, who for some reason looks quite proud. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why didn&rsquo;t she report to me that Gabil&rsquo;s father is coming? Stop acting all smug over there.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion completely fails to notice my reaction. She is the opposite of her diligent secretary appearance. This girl is the picture opposite of reliable.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What a shame.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Huh huh! It is only natural when the one you are greeting is Rimuru-sama himself!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion spills such nonsense all delighted by herself. I guess I&rsquo;ll just ignore her for now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is quite comforting however that she seems to be happier when I&rsquo;m the one being praised over herself. But telling her so would only fuel her arrogance, so it would be better to just keep my mouth shut. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">To summarize, the news of my ascension to Demon Lord has spread across the lands and I&rsquo;ll be having a lot of visitors from all over the forest soon. Perhaps they all think it is better to be protected under the Demon Lords than to stand against them.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, a lot of monsters are going to visit this town. We would be busy attending to them all. And next, we will need to investigate the Jura Great Forest and reach out to sentient species</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c0">. While it won&rsquo;t be a problem for them if they acknowledge my authority as the ruler of the region, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t have other things to worry about as well. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But regardless, we would be busy no matter what, so we should&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m thinking, aren&rsquo;t we going to inform the outside world about the news of my ascension to Demon Lord anyways?? If that&rsquo;s the case, how about we take advantage of it and use the news to advertise our town? Rather than having everyone visiting one at a time, it would be much more convenient to invite them here altogether at once.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">.......What do you mean?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rigurdo looks at me with doubts. So I decide to explain the idea that I just decided on in layman&rsquo;s terms.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We don&rsquo;t have to make the matter too complicated.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This town is the capital of the Tempest Federation, and more and more monsters in the Jura Great Forest are becoming aware of this place. For instance, the Kobold</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Merchants led by Kobe. I think it&rsquo;s about time to expand our population given how some have expressed their interest in joining. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Beastmen currently studying technology in the town would eventually leave our country one day, so we have to find new members to fill in the void. Furthermore, we have to improve the efficiency of skill training to make individual training sessions more worthwhile. We&rsquo;ve also improved the efficiency of our food production, so welcoming new citizens shouldn&rsquo;t pose an issue. However, the main issue here is that our labor force is lacking. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My head floods with countless potential ideas. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But there just aren&rsquo;t &nbsp;enough people at hand; that&rsquo;s an issue. We must seize this opportunity to promote the town and encourage people to come and live here. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When people come to visit me, we should also use that moment to show them around town. Some monsters may even consider migrating.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Killing two birds with one stone, actually, not only two&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Besides, we&rsquo;ve been very stressed as of late, so shouldn&rsquo;t we take a break once in a while? That&rsquo;s why I propose we should hold a festival as well!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We can decide on the date of the festival later.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We will welcome the visitors during the time when the whole town is celebrating. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And since Milim has already requested me to do so, we will have to pull off a huge festival.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">By restricting the festival to a certain time frame, we can limit the visitors to one specific time period and avoid having them sporadically visit us. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We can use our vacation time to simultaneously advertise the town. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words, taking care of everything in one go.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">A festival&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Amazing, that&rsquo;s a wonderful idea!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s do it! We will make it a grand festival!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone&rsquo;s eyes are lit up after hearing my explanation. It seems that fighting spirits are burning high in everyone&rsquo;s heart.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since we&rsquo;ve held feasts every couple of months (D: Swadian butterlord policy), we have much experience with festivals and celebrations. And as it turns out, everyone&rsquo;s getting better and better at holding festivals, with each festival grander than the one before. It would be great if for this festival we could have everyone contribute. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">We are announcing my presence to the world anyway, so we should make it worthwhile!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes sir!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No one objects.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What do you mean by budget? Pfft, why should I care about budget at this point.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rigurdo can figure that one out. Right now our treasury is loaded, so being extravagant once in a while won&rsquo;t hurt.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thanks to my words of encouragement, we got everything to progress rather quickly. We were able to quickly conclude the meeting and by the time I got back, even the plans for the invitations to national leaders were already sorted out.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Isn&rsquo;t now a bit too early to send out invitations? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I suppose it&rsquo;s fine to invite monsters, but is it really ok to invite leaders of human nations too? Though I guess we do have hot springs, as well as hotels for guest reception. There are even guesthouses to satisfy the needs of royals and nobles. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In fact, even prominent figures such as Duke Elalude and King Gazel are are extremely satisfied with the service Haruna and the others provide.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hmm, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any problem. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We could shift the dates of visits of the heads of states away from the main event and change the venues. As long as we keep the security intact, it would be a great opportunity for the leaders of the world to learn about us. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Their master&mdash;&mdash; well, that would be me&mdash;&mdash; a proper Demon Lord. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I can very well relate to everyone&rsquo;s sentiments of wanting to celebrate. I was originally a Japanese man who loved festivals as well. And if I&rsquo;m getting serious this time, I shall show them the true meaning of a festival. Moreover, I&rsquo;ll show the world that I am a not a bad Demon Lord</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And with that, the huge Tempest festival will soon be underway. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My report ends with the details of the festival pending future discussion. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Next, I listen to everyone&rsquo;s report of their recent activities.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I have a rough idea of what they&rsquo;ve been up to, but not everyone knows what the other lieutenants are working on. I might even be able to glean some new information from the discussion. Especially Diablo, I simply cannot fathom his train of thought. Should I call him lacking in common sense, or&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The things he deem trival always turn out to be important news to me. This discrepancy in judgement continues day after day. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are many times that I alone won&rsquo;t be able to make the best call. For this reason, it is important for everyone to share their thoughts with each other during regular meetings such as these.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">From Rigurdo&rsquo;s report, merchants who have traded with us once are likely to return for more.. Fuze has spread the news about the safety of our town to more people and, as a result, this town has seen more visitors than ever before.. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There hasn&rsquo;t been too much of a reaction from all the other nations. &nbsp;While they all seem cautious of the fact that I&rsquo;ve become a Demon Lord, they are mostly just observing the diplomatic relations between us and the kingdoms of Blumund and Dwargon. With how things have progressed, the Emperor (Empress)</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Elmesia Erlu Sarion has decided to reach out and form &nbsp;diplomatic relations with Tempest Federation. She seems to be implying &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Get the roads done fast</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to us. But it also carries the confirmation that they are willing to provide us their powerful backing as support.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Their declaration seems to have been broadcasted with magic to the heads of other nations as well, which apparently has given many of them headaches. I seem to have heard of something similar when I was discussing it with Fuze and King Gazel.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Haha, amazing! It seems that everyone has kept their word and is in turn pressuring the other nations around the world!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rigurdo delightfully concludes his report.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After Rigurdo, it is Souei&rsquo;s turn to speak. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Given that much of the investigation work has been handed to Souei, the content of his report must be quite enlightening. Souei even has had his hand in the preparation of the road construction to Sorcerers&rsquo; Dynasty Sarion. He didn&rsquo;t help with the construction, of course. Instead, I told him to do some reconnaissance.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll determine the specific route of the road later.So I basically had Souei &nbsp;investigate things such as whether or not there are monster tribes nearby that would interfere with the construction. We&rsquo;ve conducted similar investigations during the construction of roads between Dwargon and Brumund, which is why it is so important. We can&rsquo;t overlook such things; otherwise, there may be potential conflicts in the future. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">While most monsters in our sphere of influence so far have been cooperative, some may express opposition when they are forced to move due the construction of the road. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nowadays, since I&rsquo;ve become a Demon Lord, any monster with just half a brain wouldn&rsquo;t want to stand against me. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I can just do whatever I want, which I will keep in mind. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I do want to prevent violent suppression, but that&rsquo;s low hanging fruit. My end goal is coexistence between men and monsters and to achieve racial equality at birth. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hopefully this time we won&rsquo;t have any issues. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve already asked so much from the monsters within my domain. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We gave shelter for people who came to us in order to prevent unnecessary&mdash;&mdash; Oh yeah, we have to tell the residents who live in the path of the new road to move. I want to avoid unnecessary conflict, and it will be best for me to have them come negotiate with us nicely. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It won&rsquo;t matter even if there are tribes on the planned construction route, I&rsquo;ll just prepare some decent lodgings for them to move into. I hope to make such locations into the likes of travelling waypoints with many hotels to service both humans and monsters alike. There may be some issues along the way, but at the end of the day, life will be more prosperous. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Just like last time, and the time before that, I hope this one would go smoothly as well&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Such thoughts wandered in my head while I waited for Souei&rsquo;s report.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">There weren&rsquo;t any hostile monsters spotted on the planned construction route or the neighbouring areas. They all approved of Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s plan as soon as I explained it.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oh oh, that&rsquo;s wonderful.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Our goal isn&rsquo;t to drive them away from their homes, so we are very fortunate to have their understanding.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is that so? Great then. Since Geld is available now, I&rsquo;ll have him do the measurements as well as &nbsp;handling some other issues.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The investigative work is concluded since we finished the exploration of the construction site. After some security checks to ensure safety, we can send in the technical crew to do the work.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Another moment if you may, there is still one more issue. Since the Jura Great Forest is now under Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s control, it will include the Coscia Mountains near the border zone. It is an area with dangerous rapids and steep hills, and, in addition, the hidden village of the Tengu tribes resides at the mountain top. This is a secret gleaned from the local residents that cannot be overlooked.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">On the southwest side of the capital of Tempest Federation, Rimuru, there is a mountainous region connected to Sith Lake. The region is named the Coscia Mountains, where the orcs have also moved to.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is said that the city of Demon Lord Frey is located on land extending from the Southern Coscia Mountains. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is a beautiful mountain range filled with steep peaks overlooking the clouds. But it is an extremely mysterious land that would pose quite the ordeal to anyone wishing to visit. According to the construction plan this time, the roads we are building would extend all the way to inside the territory of Sarion. There seems to be some middlingly-sized cities in the mountains&rsquo; vale, and they would likely be the destination of our construction.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It seems that we aren&rsquo;t involved with the Coscia Mountains directly, so what is Souei worrying about?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What do you mean that we cannot overlook it?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The Tengu tribe may seem to be a peaceful bunch, but they are actually innately aggressive fighters. Even Demon Lord Frey has avoided directly confronting them, so it would be best if we inform them too before proceeding&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">According to Souei&rsquo;s report, the Coscia Mountains are strictly outside of the Jura Great Forest and hence outside my field of administration. It is an independent land that isn&rsquo;t included in Frey&rsquo;s territory either.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even though I may proceed without informing the Tengus, given my authority as a Demon Lord, it is best if we are to explain the situation and prevent potential conflicts in the future. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Otherwise, they may suspect that the road is some devious act by an ambitious Demon Lord aiming to expand.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Souei seems almost apologetic reporting this to me; however, it is a marked improvement in my book. The fact that he didn&rsquo;t act recklessly on his own &nbsp;reach out to the Tengu is commendable. How cautious indeed Souei is in his acts, his report of the situation now would contribute a lot.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Very well, then I shall&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Please hold on. If that&rsquo;s the case, I shall visit there.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I was just about to propose to talk to the Tengu tribe myself when Benimaru interrupted me. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He claims that a Demon Lord just strolling by without any proper announcements would raise some red flags. I immediately come to that same conclusion &nbsp;thanks to him pointing it out, so I decide to leave that matter in Benimaru&rsquo;s hands.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Nii sama, you&rsquo;ve been quite close to Alvis-san lately, are you trying to sneak on a date with her?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What? Benimaru&rsquo;s been hitting on Alvis?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s this all about, Benimaru-kun~?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If what she said is true, this would be quite the shocking development.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s just a misunderstanding, Rimuru-sama. Shuna, please don&rsquo;t spread such rumors.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Benimaru calmly denies Shuna&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be lying given his frank attitude&hellip;...</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But given his handsome looks, there&rsquo;s no doubt he is popular amongst the ladies. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Please be rest assured, Rimuru-sama. It won&rsquo;t matter if Benimaru is gone, Rimuru-sama still has me after all!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Huh? What nonsense are you talking about?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hehe, have you been seduced by Alvis into trying to leave this country behind? Gone with the wind have you!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I mean, Shion, seriously. What has gone through your brain to have twisted your understanding of the situation like that?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion begins to say some bizzare things only to have provoked Benimaru&rsquo;s retorts.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No way. although I&rsquo;m a bit jealous not having a girlfriend and all, I don&rsquo;t think Benimaru would run and leave us behind.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion&rsquo;s delusions are truly baffling.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oi, Shion, that&rsquo;s just impossible.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right, Shion. Rimuru-sama, you &nbsp;believe me, right!?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You are my trusted right hand man, there is no way I will doubt you.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I may have said so given how long he has followed me, but I&rsquo;ve not once doubted Benimaru or feared his betrayal. But he is probably getting a girlfriend soon like Tamura.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ll see about that then.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I get the feeling that this whole conversation is quite silly, so I should just hand the real work to Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right. If we continue discussing this Shion will get the wrong idea and act like an idiot again, so this task will be handled by Benimaru!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes sir, understood!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Benimaru nods with a tired expression and accepts the mission.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Good grief.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But honestly, Benimaru is the most suitable candidate to be sent in my place. His position is just under mine and is high enough to not invite scorn. I didn&rsquo;t expect there to be such a hidden village near our border with Sarion, so it would be best to inform them from a long-term perspective.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Benimaru would probably do a better job at it than me.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I think so while concluding the issue.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The only report I haven&rsquo;t heard is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Souei, has there been any significant change in the ecology of the neighbouring monsters?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I ask about the movement of the monsters around the town and the roads.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Magicule concentration is rather high in this area &nbsp;due to many large individual magicule counts. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Areas of high magicule concentration would result in the spontaneous genesis of Monsters</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and naturally, the birth rate of harmful monsters would also increase. Even monsters below Rank D can be harmful to humans, which is why we have to stay alert and eliminate them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If dangerous monsters above Rank B suddenly appear, then all the more reason to eliminate them faster.It is due to such circumstances that security work is necessary for everyday life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The head of the security department Rigur needs to deal with that area of things. His subordinates are all veterans, and even if they were replaced by new recruits, it would only take a few weeks for them to be trained and deliver decent results. Police patrol every street to ensure the safety of human caravans.The security has been made watertight and everything seems fine as of the moment. But they have not explored the entire forest, leaving the possibility of stronger monsters to exist somewhere in there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But Souei did tell me &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t worry about it</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">....... &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What does that mean?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Does it mean we can coexist with those monsters?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As long as those monsters don&rsquo;t harm us and the travelers, they shouldn&rsquo;t pose a problem. There is no need to eliminate them if they possess intelligence and can be negotiated with. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With that being said, just like the Armored Spider (Knight Spider) that Gobta encountered before, there is no guarantee whether such Rank A local monster lords would appear or not. This is why I&rsquo;m very concerned about the security of areas far away from towns and streets. Locations where we have limited control are the breeding grounds for dangerous monsters. But we should have information about such locations since Souei has sent out his [Clones].</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s hear about the reports then.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">There is no big trouble. If anything, there were some White Fang Bears</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;roaming in the North-west of the forest. I&rsquo;ve already dealt with them.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Souei casually adds.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hmm, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an issue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Warning. White Fang Bear is equal to a Knight Spider, with both being Rank A.</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oi, that monster you mentioned, isn&rsquo;t that a high-rank monster that any normal adventure would have difficulty fighting?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His nonchalant attitude makes me panic a little. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is no way for merchants to safely travel when such dangerous monsters are roaming the area. Moreover, it would also put the security force led by Gobta in danger as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh? Souei-san, is this true? It would be quite dangerous to send our new recruit out when those types of monsters exist.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. Aren&rsquo;t you spoiling them too much?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hold on a second! While those monsters may not be much for Souei-san, they are no easy foes for us.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Naturally, Gobta starts to complain. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet Souei still looks quite apathetic&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Then why don&rsquo;t you just go ask for Hakurou&rsquo;s help and have him train you harder?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He replies with such scary words looking all serious.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hakurou nods in agreement. Poor Gobta.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although I&rsquo;m more interested in Gobta&rsquo;s reaction as he doesn&rsquo;t seem to fear the White Fang Bear itself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gobta has indeed undergone significant magicule growth. He is now a Rank B veteran. With that being said, he still has a long way to go before reaching Rank A.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Wisdom King Raphael-san, did you misjudge Gobta&rsquo;s ability?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Answer. His power after </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Assimilation</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;with a Star Wolf would increase. However, the change in power cannot be accurately measured.</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oh oh, I see.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">His power should increase to around Rank A- after </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Assimilation</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with a Star Wolf. Gobta is the captain of the Goblin Riders after all, so it&rsquo;s no wonder he doesn&rsquo;t take monsters like the White Fang Bear seriously. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Speaking of which, I&rsquo;ve heard rumors of Gobta taking an attack head on from one of Clayman&rsquo;s generals. His experience training with Hakurou has made him stronger. I almost got deceived by his unchanged appearance; could it be that Gobta is actually very strong?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Feeling reassured by Gobta&rsquo;s growth, I decide to move on to the next order of business and mediate the discussion.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Calm down everyone. Gobta has a point too. Although you yourself may be able to handle it without a sweat, don&rsquo;t expect everyone to be like you, Souei.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I interject. It would be bad to spread the idea that everyone has to rely on their own power to resolve problems. verage people will find it difficult to keep up when comparing their strength to the more powerful individuals which in turn would lead to reduced productivity. Forcing them to shoulder all that responsibility may discourage them and in turn cause negative effects</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I raised several specific examples regarding that point to explain it to everyone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;My sincerest apologies, I was being inconsiderate.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Souei apologizes upon listening to my explanation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone is different. Although Souei&rsquo;s subordinates are strong enough to meet his high expectations, not everyone else has the ability to meet those demands.. Hopefully he will keep that in mind. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Not only Souei, it should also be the same case for Benimaru and Hakurou. I hope they will train our companions properly with an open mind. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In that regard, both Geld and Gabil are very considerate of their subordinates, so I don&rsquo;t have to worry too much about them. I hope Souei can improve his relationship with his subordinates by learning from those two.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But I have something more to say.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">However, training for Gobta and his men is a good thing as well. They can learn to keep their cool when facing unexpected emergency!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I add. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hakurou grins at my remark while Gobta hangs his head dejectedly. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The extent of growth that everyone can achieve may all be different, so it is always good to have more training. It&rsquo;s just like reading books! You might acquire knowledge that will eventually become useful one day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I can only request Gobta to work harder in the future. Well anyways, it&rsquo;s time to cut to the chase. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The issue surrounding the birth of monsters. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My worries weren&rsquo;t unfounded as the forest really did spawn some dangerous monsters. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I shouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about the security force as they&rsquo;ve all prepared healing potions just in case, and with how fast the Star Wolves can travel, they shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem escaping from such situations. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, that same logic cannot be applied to the visitors to our nation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">With the high magicule concentration within our forest, it&rsquo;s no wonder that abnormal monsters will be born. We have to draft a plan to deal with this before we end up with any casualties.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">While strengthening our security net is one way to do it, it won&rsquo;t fix the issue in the long run,. Maintaining such a large scale operation would only increase our burden. The place where monsters gather would naturally have an increased magicule concentration, if we can&rsquo;t get rid of the root cause, we will always have to remain on guard.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then, what should we do&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As I was worrying about this, an unexpected proposal comes along to save the day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, how about we apply an anti-monster barrier to the street?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Vesta suggests.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kaijin also stands up to speak, almost as if saying </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve just been waiting for that line.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">My lord, I&rsquo;ve already built the device&mdash;&mdash;A prototype of a fully automatic magic motor that can activate the barrier.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Kaijin finishes his words with a confident smile.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I am aware that Kaijin has been developing things behind my back, but did he just mention a fully automatic magic motor? &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is said to be an epoch-making magic machine that can automatically maintain the magic detected within. It is like an advanced version of a magic item that has specific magic imbued within it, however, the capacity and efficiency of this version is completely on a different level.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They seem to be quite troubled for not being of much help during the previous incident involving a barrier (Farmus Invasion). That is why Kaijin and Vesta apparently led the initiative in researching these technologies.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Aren&rsquo;t you two too overpowered? (in brain power) To come up with a prototype in such short amount of time, could they be actual geniuses?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That was my initial impression, but it turns out that I may have been overthinking things.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gabil also participated in the development during his spare time with the help of Kurobee (who unfortunately is not present at the moment). Even Shuna contributed. It is the grand result backed by all of our magic technologies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is quite moving.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Kaijin seems to have adapted a life of grinding research 24/7 after having handed over his job in blacksmithing to Kurobee. But since he is the head of the manufacturing department in Tempest Federation, there is no way that he would be able to drown himself in research&hellip;&hellip; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Kaijin explains the mechanism to me in detail. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The automatic magic motor seems to have been set to collect spare magicules floating in the air. And to be honest, this area possesses a high concentration of magicules. He came up with such a contraption knowing that it didn&rsquo;t make sense to leave these spare magicules unused.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Barrier of Aerial Magic Silence</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;from that time also cleansed the magicules within it.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s use these surrounding monsters as an example, the Monsters will absorb (breathe in) the surrounding magicules in the atmosphere and produce </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Crystals</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. Kaijin and the rest seemed to have taken some inspiration from this and set about researching the principles behind them. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In addition, as previously emphasized, this kingdom constitutes of a very high concentration of magicules. Even though everyone believes that they are suppressing themselves, part of their Youki (demonic aura) is still leaking out into the atmosphere in large quantities. If you consider an average cave where a horde of Rank B+ monsters reside, the magicule concentration of that location would be very high indeed. By that logic,, the magicule concentration would most definitely be abnormally high in this kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So what should we do to face this challenge? It appears that Kaijin and the others have also been troubled by this problem for some time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Can we apply an anti-monster barrier with this automatic magic motor?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Of course. And there is more benefits to it than just that!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Vesta adds confidently.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He and Kaijin looks at eachother and laugh. The two seem to be getting along really well, making their quarrel in the past almost dream-like. Ah, let&rsquo;s put that aside for now and hear their explanation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But isn&rsquo;t anti-monster barrier used to prevent a monster invasion? What benefits are there besides that?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hehehe, don&rsquo;t get scared when you hear it, my lord! This automatic magic motor is equipped with a device to collect magicules. We can lower the magicule concentration in the atmosphere by effectively using this feature!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Are you serious! I almost gasped at his answer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now we have found a solution to our pressing problem!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed, Rimuru-sama. But, there is one problem with this device. If the concentration of magicules is not high enough, the low efficiency would render the device useless.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But, my lord, will this really be a problem in this town?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After hearing the end of Vesta and Kaijin&rsquo;s explanation, I nod to them in response.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Such concern is completely unnecessary since we are after all, worrying about magicule concentration being too high at the moment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Does the device activate and maintain the barrier automatically as long as it is collecting magicules in the air?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Not exactly, though it can be used like that too. The magic would disappear if the magicules that it uses as fuel run out. That&rsquo;s why we made it so that you can replenish it with fuel directly.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Here is Kaijin&rsquo;s explanation: There is no need to worry about magicule depletion for the device near the vicinity of Tempest Federation, but the closer it is to the Western Nations, the less concentrated magicule is. It will be an issue if the barrier deactivates without notice. That&rsquo;s why their design uses replenishable fuel to run the motor. Its fuel comes from the crystallization of magicule in the atmosphere&mdash;&mdash;the so called </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Crystal</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Normally, we wouldn&rsquo;t consider using </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Crystal</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as fuel directly due to its low efficiency. Unlike the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Stone</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;crafted by the Freedom Association with unique technology, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Crystal</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is very unstable. If directly converted to mana, ninety percent of its content would dissipate and be wasted.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why people would prefer </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Stone</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as fuel&hellip;&hellip;. However, we had </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Great Sage</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;who was able to find the most effective spell from </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Engraving Magic</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. As long as the energy output is greater than energy input of the fuel, it won&rsquo;t matter even if it isn&rsquo;t Magic Stone. We were able to benefit greatly before by researching such technology since we didn&rsquo;t have the fund to purchase the expansive Magic Stones. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We can still activate the magic barrier even when the energy loss is pushed to the maximum, good enough performance can be achieved with a mere ten percent of its input power. The lost magicule would not disappear completely either, but dissipate to the atmosphere. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And of course, that is also recyclable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">From this, we can see that it will be no fantasy to allow machines to function perpetually with high enough concentration of magicule. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We have even come up with another way to use it. For instance, we can produce </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Crystal</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in large quantity and deliver them to be processed into </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Stone</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at Freedom Association. In this way, we will have a much more effective use of the material.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">With that being said, the most important thing here&mdash;&mdash;is that the motor will be able to lower the concentration of magicule in the atmosphere. With the magicule concentration lowered, the rate of monster or demon</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;spawns will also decrease. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What a truly extraordinary invention.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It will become an indispensable contraption that will make up for the nature of our kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">We in fact also have discovered the method to extract Magic Stone from the energy source. But, we will still require special devices for such extraction. It is quite challenging to do so with our available devices, but we are still trying to figure out a way to directly use </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Magic Crystal</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Kaijin makes such confident claim.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He has found ways to collect magicule from the atmosphere and crystallize it into </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Crystal</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">. And so the next step of his research became finding out the principle behind the production of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Process</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The large quantity of Magic Stones I purchased from Ingracia Kingdom apparently proved to be useful, yet the conclusion of his research was that there are still difficulties in producing them by ourselves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I suppose that would be the case. I seem to recall hearing about the need of a factory installed with large-scale devices required to process and produce Magic Stones. In fact, the production of them seem to be extremely difficult. Even though we may know the method, putting it to practice is not going to be easy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Don&rsquo;t worry, we don&rsquo;t have to be worry ourselves over it.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since we can also just directly utilize </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Crystal</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, we don&rsquo;t have to address the said issue so urgently. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">On the other hand, the use of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Crystal</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as a fuel seems surprisingly simple.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The stones would use their magicule (mana) to cast the spells of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Engraving Magic</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to form magic circles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Moreover, this motor device can produce more than just a barrier!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Vesta shouts excitedly.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How surprisingly, there may be a limit to how much magic it can use, yet it can cast more than just a barrier alone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They have carved the magic spells into a discs made of magisteel. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is said that by swapping these magic discs, it will execute different kinds of magic effects. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">For example, it is like a record disc. The automatic magic motor is the equivalent of a music player. They consume </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Crystal</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;instead of batteries. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although I told them about media such as record disc and such, I didn&rsquo;t expect them to craft such magic items by stretching their creativity. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It may develop in the future to become smaller version of the device similar to the size of a CD player and may even be carried around as an equipment, or perhaps upsize and use it to cast tactical magic? &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ahhh, so many possibilities.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As for the current size of the automatic magic motor, it is a cuboidal device with length of one meter. It has a thickness of around fifty centimeters and can take up quite the space. Transportation of the device will not be easy due to its heavy weight. With that being said, if we can replace the loaded </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Crystal</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;directly, we will not need to move the device itself. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Vesta plans to place them alongside the stone tablets on the streets in order to activate for the anti-monster barriers. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">By documenting the expiration of the fuel, we can maintain the barrier by recharging them during the patrolling hour of the day. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They also mention that there is no need to recharge if the magicule concentration is high enough. So in reality, we only need to send patrol to examine whether there is any issue with the barrier.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve really thought about everything. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is indeed a convenient magical device with versatility. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With one device installed every ten kilometers, we can ensure the complete safety of the neighbouring area. And we will also build an outpost every twenty kilometers so that patrolling will be less troublesome.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right, about the spell engraving of that barrier&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hehehe, Dord would handle that. The mass production of the motor will be handled by Kurobee-san, we are just waiting for my lord to approve.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The people being trained by me have also grown quite a lot, and so we are not giving them lectures as frequently as before. Right now I am free of duty, so please entrust this mission to me!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Vesta must also want to confirm the initiation process of the project besides the researching. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His eyes are glowing with expectations. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Once the motors are successfully installed, the problem with magicule concentration will also be swiftly resolved.

The heavy weights of these devices to the humans only pose a minor burden to monsters. Their difference in efficiency is night and day.

That&rsquo;s easy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Me? I have stored everything in my </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Stomach</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A long time ago, after being inspired by Rigurdo, I put all my suppressed aura into my </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Stomach</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. Nowadays I have reached a state of perfection with its usage and is able to store the aura without any leakage at all.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After my evolution to a Demon Lord, my magicule storage greatly increased, while my </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Predator</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;also evolved to </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Gluttonous &nbsp;King Beelzebub</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, the capacity of my </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Stomach</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;also increased beyond measurement. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That is why I don&rsquo;t have such a need for unleashing my aura.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But Rimuru-sama, it is extremely difficult for someone like Veldora-sama to completely suppress his aura. Even Benimaru-sama and the others have some of their aura leaking out.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Said Diablo.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes! Diablo. You understand don&rsquo;t you. Tell Rimuru more about just how hard I&rsquo;ve been working!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Veldora adds on happily while nodding. And so Diablo begins to explain things to me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Apparently demon race is extremely skillful at controlling their aura and magic, that&rsquo;s why they are able to contain their aura perfectly. Assessed by the master of aura suppression Diablo, Veldora&rsquo;s act is of a perfect score.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Veldora indeed possesses extraordinary immense amount of magicule, so maintaining a state with his aura suppressed must be exhausting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is that really the case, Veldora?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hmm! I&rsquo;ve been suppressing my aura ever since you taught me how.

Wherever he finds to release his aura would probably turn its surrounding to a land of death. He may even cause a bunch of dangerous monsters to be spawned. It may even give birth to monsters at the same level as Charybdis. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If a real Calamity level threat is spawned, even if harmless, will still be treated as a dangerous creature by other nations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I understand.

I can understand that your eagerness to recruit them into your team, but I think some training for them before that is necessary.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But this is merely an excuse.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Geld can contact his tribesmen through </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Telepathy Net</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and quickly mobilize them to form a team.

It is practical and can reduce lapses. But, what about the captives if you only give preferential treatments to your own kin that you can reach out to? Did you plan to give these captives simple chores that anyone can do?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That, that is&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Geld seems to come to some revelation having been advised by me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We indeed require labour force in the future, but while we still have time and energy now, we should also train those captives. Personnel training can only be successfully carried out given sufficient time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover, if Geld only treats his own tribesmen well today, it may lead to unnecessary hierarchy of treatment in the future. I will not permit such a thing to happen when my goal is to build a paradise for different species to coexist.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That is why we are at a crucial moment now.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Besides, Geld.

Diablo seems to have gotten hold of this information as both of them frequently nod in agreement to Diablo&rsquo;s report. The movements of the nations have to do with the plan to help Youmu rise to power.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As for the status of Youmu, I was informed of it among other things from Diablo&rsquo;s report.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Putting aside becoming a king, Youmu hasn&rsquo;t even had any noble education. He probably can&rsquo;t even properly engage with any nobles or royalties. Right now, the previous King of Farmus Edmalis has been acting as Youmu&rsquo;s mentor under Diablo&rsquo;s instruction. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He probably won&rsquo;t attempt anything devious under Diablo&rsquo;s surveillance. So I can leave the teaching to him being reassured. Depending on how things progress, it may be quite interesting to recruit and use him in the future. It will definitely be of help to Youmu if that&rsquo;s the case.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo mentions about his plan again and explains it altogether to the executives.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">While listening, I make a mental note-- that I should meet this man, Edmalis. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And the new king on the other hand, of course, is plotting some schemes behind the scene.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But, it&rsquo;ll be some time before he can make his move right?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">To reorganize the army and mobilize once again will likely require several months at the least.,</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Or so I thought, but Diablo answered differently. His reply was completely different from what I imagined.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Kufufufufu. I wish to resolve the matter as soon as possible, so I&rsquo;m speeding things along.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He says so with a delightful smile.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ah? Eh... then we won&rsquo;t be able to prepare&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Not to worry. I&rsquo;ve already requested Benimaru-dono to prepare an expeditionary force accordingly.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed. I&rsquo;ve prepared fully for that part. Both the troop that will be infiltrating the public to operate under the sun and the troops carrying out covert missions in the dark have been properly arranged. I in fact spent more time selecting candidates since everyone wanted to participate.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo and Benimaru put on a smooth duet with how casually both explained the preparations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve skipped reporting these things to me in the past, almost as if the matter is only as important as telling me the time of their hiking trip.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I personally consider this whole thing to be quite significant, you know&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">However, though not posing a problem, something is indeed troubling me. I haven&rsquo;t bought this up before since it wasn&rsquo;t worthy of a report, but Rayheim has yet to return.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Erasing his smile, Diablo adds on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oh yeah.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve been wondering what I forgot and now I finally recall.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The message we sent to Hinata has not been replied.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is he the Archbishop that you sent out to respond the summoning of the Western Saints Church? Did he not bring my message? Or could it be that the message did not safely arrive?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No, I had Rayheim carry the crystal ball and sent him to the capital of Ingracia Kingdom with my men protecting him. A </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Teleportation Gate</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was set up there for his transportation, so theoretically he should have directly reached the headquarter of Western Saints Church in Holy Empire Ruberios&hellip;&hellip;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It will take two weeks of carriage ride for someone to travel from Farmus Kingdom to Ingracia Kingdom by the coast. Transporting from there to Holy Empire Ruberios would take three weeks more of time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With that being said, magic does exist in this world. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is a special hallway set in between Ingracia and Ruberios called </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Teleportation Gate</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. You can travel between the two nations instantly by passing special dimension through the gate. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Only extremely high-ranked officials are aware of this gateway, but it probably won&rsquo;t come as a surprise to Rayheim who was the Archbishop of a strong nation. He must then also possess the status to use that gateway. It is said that he went straight for the capital as soon as he had entered Ingracia Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Greater Demon servants summoned by Diablo confirmed that Rayheim had arrived at the capital. That city is however deployed with barriers which would cause commotions if Greater Demons invade. That&rsquo;s why they reported back to Diablo after Rayheim entered the city.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">After which, he has not left the capital at all?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed. I told my servants to continue their surveillance of the capital and they are supposed to report to me as soon as Rayheim exits.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet he says that his servants still have not reported back.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, has Rayheim remained at the Western Saints Church?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Could it be that someone tried to silent him by murdering him?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I couldn&rsquo;t help but comment when the worst case scenario crosses my mind.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But, Diablo rejects my theory.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No, right now I haven&rsquo;t sensed it. My Unique Skill </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Tempter</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;would deprive my dominated subjects of their souls when they die.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words, as long as his soul hasn&rsquo;t been deprived, the person is still alive. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s quite a scary skill, but I&rsquo;ll put that aside for now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There were also several Templar Knights guarding him, so he probably thinks the capital there is safe without any hazard. Yet Rayheim still hasn&rsquo;t returned. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It may be that the inquiry meeting from within the Western Saints Church has been taking too much time, so it is perhaps not the time to worry. But this is indeed worrying. But it&rsquo;s fine as long as he is still alive.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hopefully he won&rsquo;t be silenced and cause us to be labeled as the culprit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">In other words, right now we have no idea what Western Saints Church plan to do.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes. They may interfere with my plan, but under the circumstances right now, it is hard to make a judgement. We can only maximize our guards in order to take precaution against whatever is to come.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hmm. How problematic if that&rsquo;s really the case. We really can&rsquo;t get a clear read on the situation with this limited information.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If we have sufficient information, I can just leave it to be fully handled by Wisdom King Raphael-san.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I am most ashamed. The risk is simply too high to infiltrate Ruberios&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No no no, it&rsquo;s alright! No good will come out of forced actions.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Seeing Souei&rsquo;s regretful expression, I quickly comfort him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It will take Souei himself to investigate the domain of Western Saints Church, who are nemesis to us monsters. Moreover, with Hinata as their leader, I have reservations to send Souei out. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Such a task can&rsquo;t at all be dealt with by Souka and the rest. They will definitely be executed if found. That&rsquo;s why I have ordered them to act cautiously and never overplay their cards.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But, even if that&rsquo;s the case&hellip;&hellip; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Will they be hostile to us or not?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We implied in the message I sent that I can forget about the things that happened in the past.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although I also provoked them a bit in the message, I hope they can just overlook that part.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;No, this is not good at all. But since I&rsquo;ve sent out the message, there is no use crying over spilled milk. (D: Almost like a certain translator sent out a reddit teaser when he could use more time to edit. My bad guys. Cube: I&#39;m still pissed at that)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I basically expressed my willingness to engage with them peacefully, so I hope they will understand my intention.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata is smart, and I believe she will make the right call.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It will be most ideal if they choose to coexist rather than antagonizing us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now apart from the Eight-Star Demon Lords, the only faction to be alerted is the Western Saints Church.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Our relation with the Eastern Empire is tense as well, but there is no sign of them taking any action yet. So as long as the Western Saints Church does not interfere, Diablo&rsquo;s plan should not fail.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s quite a challenging issue. I personally think that we should just resolve things by fighting a war with them once and for all.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rather than leaving a potential threat, Benimaru prefers a clear result through war.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But we will be done if we are defeated, so I still hope for a peaceful resolution.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shuna suddenly opens up, looking rather intrigued:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">We were under attack when Rimuru-sama battled against Hinata the Saint. The two incidents must have some connections and someone probably orchestrated all these behind the scene.

But considering calmly from our opponents&rsquo; perspective, even Hinata would probably wish to avoid direct conflict with us right now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The message I sent to them also made clear that I don&rsquo;t wish to be hostile against them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With my good intention shown, Hinata wouldn&rsquo;t be so stupid as to still stand against Tempest Federation consisting of me, a Disaster-ranked creature and Catastrophe-ranked Veldora.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">By assessing the potential loss alone would show that she stands to gain no benefit from doing so. Even if she triumphs, all she will get is reputation, which obviously would not be enough to make up for the loss that will be sustained by the Western Saints Church. It won&rsquo;t make sense to start such a war without any profit to gain. Hinata may not listen to people&rsquo;s words, but she is not that ignorant as to not see the cost and benefit of things.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With that being said, I still have some concerns reserved.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;The God Ruminas&hellip;&hellip;Ruminas?

But he seems to be rather concerned about something.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hinata mentioned that we are obstacles. That is because of the doctrines of Western Saints Church&mdash;&mdash;The Ruminas Sect does not tolerate monsters. However, there may be more reason to it&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why would Hinata consider us as obstacles?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sure the doctrine of Ruminasism does not tolerate the existence of monsters,d &nbsp; But, if that&rsquo;s the only reason, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be particularly rational one. Meaning that, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like the sort of thing Hinata would do.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In which case, there must be some other reason behind it&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although this may contradict the theory just now, what would it make of the person manipulating behind the scene. Assuming that there is indeed someone other than Hinata trying to meddle with our business.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What would be this person&rsquo;s goal?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Report. It is most likely that several persons are involved in the matter. The series of events are all connected. But, it is speculated that these events were not all carried out by the same person.</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, would it mean&hellip;&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Answer. It involves several countries, individuals, dynamics and other factors. A number of intents have been pinpointed after analysis. The intents may seem to have common goals, there are contradictions among them. Thus attributing all occurred events to one mastermind is unreasonable.</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words, there is more than one person behind the scene. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It does make a lot of sense this way and easier to see. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It means that Clayman was but one of the people being manipulated. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oh I see, it makes a lot more sense thinking in this direction.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These may jump at each others&rsquo; aid when their goals align, but in reality they are not moving according to each others&rsquo; order. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These masterminds may also only have instigated them. It may be that Hinata has nothing to do with the people behind the scene in the first place.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Indeed, things are more clear when considering there to be multiple people involved in the grand scheme of things. Moreover, once situation changes, there may no longer be a need to be hostile against certain party. That is how international affairs work without the involvement of personal emotions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Clayman saw us as an eyesore and he also tried to manipulate us.That&rsquo;s why he was rejoiced to see that I and Hinata had our fight to the death. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Farmus Kingdom thought that me becoming the leader of the federation is an obstacle. They didn&rsquo;t wish to eliminate Tempest Federation, but to take over the kingdom. That&rsquo;s why they also wanted to see that Hinata would take care of me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So what was Hinata herself thinking? &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Of course, she couldn&rsquo;t spare a monster like me on the ground of the doctrines she upheld.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Things began to unfold when all three parties&rsquo; goal aligned. The results were my escape from Hinata&rsquo;s pursuit, defeat of Farmus in battle and the demise of Clayman.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The time forwards to the present.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The situations have changed for every one of the mastermind. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">With Clayman&rsquo;s death, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That Lord</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;behind him is likely focusing on replenishing the lost troops due to the conflict.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, will he still confront me directly?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Answer. The likelihood of which is extremely low. If the individual possess more force than Clayman, he will have intervened already. Even if he had preserved forces, his attack plan has failed miserably. It is thus meaningless for him to intervene again now.</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So basically he doesn&rsquo;t have any motive to attack me now. Is that the case?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That person has been hidden behind the scene this entire time, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be the time for him yet to come out under the sun to operate. Even if he tries to strike back, he would know that directly confronting us would be simply foolish.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Based on this deduction, what would the other factions do?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">King Edmalis&rsquo; ambition is all gone after stepping down.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The new king seems to be on the go. His faction is probably not short of people who wants to harm us. To him our nation is an obstacle, and so it&rsquo;s likely that they haven&rsquo;t given up on eliminating us with schemes. But, these people are being watched by Diablo. It is too late for them to pose a threat now even if they add in on the list of the masterminds behind the scene.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However I still can&rsquo;t overlook them that easily.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There may be people with concealed identity among them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why humans are hard to deal with.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There hasn&rsquo;t been any news from the Western Saints Church.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rayheim has yet to return, which is probably implication that the church is in a chaotic state internally as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Maybe Hinata is lost as well? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since antagonizing us requires a clear justification, and there is no necessity to strike us without a motive. But, what if Hinata continues wish to be hostile even without a motive? &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It would mean that she was forced to actions under some circumstances.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Warning. Reminder that there may be several hidden masterminds behind the scene.</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Indeed, that is the case.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If there are indeed several people behind the scene, how things develop will not be able to be controlled by Hinata. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The situation now cannot be treated with optimism, I will have to be mentally prepared.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">We should think in the direction that there are too many interests involved in the matter that Hinata&rsquo;s will alone will not be able to determine how the overall circumstance develop. Am I right?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As I came up with a conclusion, Diablo seems to arrive at the same view.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Very impressive indeed, Diablo.

The reason why Farmus Kingdom wished to attack our town was due to their belief that there is profit to gain from doing so.

They have detected an unusual aura of danger. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s been several days since the duel between Hinata Sakaguchi and Rimuru. The Church has been unable to reach Archbishop Rayheim since his march alongside the Farmus Army. It is an established rule to always send regular reports back, yet he has not responded, meaning something has gone wrong with their march on Tempest Federation. When she received the news, Hinata decided to head to Tempest Federation herself. Yet, before she could leave, she received the divine order to stand guard at the Holy Church.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The reason was: the revival of</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Veldora. She was barred from marching as she was left to wait for the gathering of the Holy Knight Order to rain destruction on the Tempest Federation in her stead. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s hard to tell who&rsquo;s luckier in this situation...... &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata most certainly would be defeated if confronting Veldora directly without preparation. But now that Hinata is aware of Veldora&rsquo;s revival, she can strategize a direct invasion of the Tempest Federation. A Tempest Federation without Rimuru would have long been annihilated. Hinata&rsquo;s goal is Tempest Federation alone, not Veldora. She could have easily achieve this using her powers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She was the one with the upper hand.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;But that is not considering Veldora&rsquo;s recent activities and the reaction of Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words, she was able to avoid the worst ending for both sides.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Protected within the gentle light of the domed holy barrier lies the Holy Capital.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This barrier is the product of countless years of research and improvement, the highest level of protective barrier. It is able to prevent all forms of enemy invasion and has defended this city for thousands of years&mdash;&mdash;The prayers of the denizens turned into reality. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The barrier even blocks out sunlight and can automatically adjust the brightness of the interior space. There will be more brightness in the morning and less at night. This created a thermostatic environment within the interior so the temperature is maintained throughout the year. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The city&rsquo;s farm lands are divided into districts where crops from whichever season can be collected at anytime. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is like an idealized arcadia where the citizens will never suffer famine. &nbsp;Every citizen has a job and all the children receive an appropriate level of education. It is an heaven in the mortal realm where everything is appropriately arranged and managed by the law.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is the capital of Holy Empire Ruberios</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;Holy Capital </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ruen</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">On the day of the Walpurgis Banquet, </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata is on her way to the holy church.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The solemn atmosphere is neutralized by the gentle warmth of the sun.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is a prosperous kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Here, no one suffers from starvation, nor are there any beggars on the street. Everyone is given an appropriate job or duty, and they fulfill their assigned purpose to the best of their abilities. They rise as the bell rings and rest as the sun falls. The more capable people would guide the less capable ones, and as such, with proper regulation, the citizens are able to enjoy a prosperous life. In the name of God, they have been granted the ideal, equitable society. This holy city is the greatest representation of that.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata observes the expression of a passersby.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone wears a gentle and kind smile.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, there is something that concerns her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She always has some doubts whenever she spends time in this city.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In Hinata&rsquo;s eyes, this holy land is no doubt the ideal heaven on earth. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Turning the Western Nations as well as the whole world into a peaceful society without conflict&mdash;&mdash;-That is Hinata&rsquo;s ambitious dream. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata hopes for a society where the strong do not prey on the weak. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, the reality of this world is simply too cruel.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Ingracia Kingdom and Holy Empire Ruberios have differences of night and day, which often troubles her. By nature, Ingracia, the kingdom of freedom, and Ruberios, who preaches no conflict, are the polar opposites from political structure to ideology; Every aspect of either society contrasts each other greatly.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The biggest difference perhaps is&mdash;&mdash;The expressions on the children. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She can hear the sound of children coming from the educational facility next to the holy church. Several children who seem to be running late for class are heading down the hallway towards the building. The faster child is holding onto the hand of the slower one. This is a common sight that she has seen in this city. Yet even now, she can tell the difference from this to that in Ingracia.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So what would happen if it was in Ingracia Kingdom? &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She recalls the scene she witnessed there.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What would it be like?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It would happen in the morning, when the faster children would sprint through the door just before the bell and have triumphant smiles on their face. The slower ones would arrive late to be scolded by the teachers by themselves. And when that happens, the children who are not late would mock at the slower children.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What if they are to run like children in Ruberios with their hands held by each others&rsquo;?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They would probably all be late and get scolded by the teacher. But of course, you can avoid being late by getting up a little earlier.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s not really enough to hold as a comparison. It&rsquo;s a rather unimportant incident.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She always ponder on that.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What is really different in that scenario? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Were the faster children not caring enough? No.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is really nothing wrong with the children to mock their peers who arrived late. They were not doing so to look down on them or ridicule them as fools. After all, the children who arrived late were laughing awkwardly as well. &nbsp;They seemed rather delightful even after being scolded.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So what is the case in Ruberios?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She looks towards the running children to see the same expressions on everyone else.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A gentle smile&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The same expressions of satisfaction that is seen on every adult; the same expression of someone who has lost their sense of competitiveness and personal identity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This society is built to create constant happiness, yet there is no sense of freedom. Everyone is equal and given their own responsibilities.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">On top of that, equity is upheld for those who are able to help those who are not. The people of this kingdom make the basis of their nation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Creating a equal society without conflict</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, that is Hinata&rsquo;s pursuit in life. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There will no longer be children abandoned by their parents. Everyone will live a happy life in this world.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is too idealistic to be practical&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s what Hinata thought as well. But when she almost gave up such dream, she saw that Ruberios was the manifestation of the ideal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Competitiveness will lead to conflict. Yet this society is so well regulated that there is no form of competition at all, the equivalent of Hinata&rsquo;s ideal. And with regards to the form of government Holy Empire Ruberios has adapted, it is strictly speaking, close to communism. It&rsquo;s the government that leaves the order of all things to &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">God</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in order to assure absolute equality.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">God&mdash;&mdash;as represented by the Pope of the Pope&rsquo;s Ministry.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But if there is any weakness to communism, it would be the existence of a ruling class. Its doctrine of equality is built on the inevitable presence of an authority. And once the people high up in the chain of command are corrupted, it becomes hard for the people under their authority to get rid of their rulers. There would be unjust in the distribution of wealth to widen the wealth gap.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In order to make up for such flaws, the government has handed their authority to God. The Pope&#39;s Ministry thus acts as the ruling figure to ensure the equality of their citizens.

More advanced vampires do not even need to ingest blood to be immortal. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whenever their human food-stock are happier, their blood tastes more delicious. And it is for that reason, the humans living in this kingdom are much more prosperous than other places. The only possible issue is when a vampire might inhale too many spirits at once, and as a result, Ruminas has such behaviour. The lesser vampires would not dare to disobey the Primogenitor Ruminas</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span class="c0">, and so they obey the rules of this kingdom wholeheartedly.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The equality in this society far outranks that of any of the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And it&rsquo;s for that reason Hinata believes in the fairness of the Ruminasism</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and first joined the Western Saints Church in pursuit of justice. She has devoted herself to spreading this religion and has since treated the doctrines as the words of God. She even became a holy knight who would give a hand to whoever is in need of help to thoroughly practice her justice.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The way of justice held by her mentor, Shizue Izawa, was too slow and gentle. Meanwhile, her fellow countryman, Yuuki Kagurazaka&rsquo;s plan seems too unrealistic to be practical in her eyes. He would only react to events after they occurred, which lacks foresight.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">People, by nature, want to overcome challenges through their own efforts, so it&rsquo;s commendable for the Freedom Association to encourage cooperation among humans. Yet their contracts rely on monetary payment to be extant, which cannot be truly fair in Hinata&#39;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why she left her teacher Shizue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;If you are ever in doubt, come see me for help.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although Shizue once said so, Hinata has no intention to do so.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shizue was just being clingy in saying that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If Hinata is to continue relying on her soft teacher, she will never achieve greatness&mdash;&mdash;She thinks so to herself, apathetically. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In this world, you can only rely on your own strength.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Hinata wants to become stronger to the point of invincibility. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She no longer wants to lose anything important to her, so she decides to stop valuing things in life. She ceased communicating with others, being solely focused on becoming stronger.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It only took her just one year to become a Holy Knight after joining the Western Saints Church.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It took less than two years for her to take the seat of the commander of the Holy Knight Order. She also started building what would be called the strongest Holy Knight Order in history.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But the higher in rank she climbed within the Church, the clearer she began to see. She was also able to see some of the hidden truths behind the veil of Ruminasism.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Pope of Ruberios&mdash;&mdash;His true identity was a vampire named Louis.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">More astoundingly, Pope Louis was the twin brother of Demon Lord Roy Valentine.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was an outrageous act of aggression for the Pope to ally himself with the Demon Lords in order to ensure his authority. It is clearly treating everyone else like fools.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Upon learning of this fact, Hinata was infuriated.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She ventured alone to the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Inner Sanctum</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to eliminate Demon Lord Roy and Pope Louis. Yet she was struck with fatal blows as well during the fight and could only lie there alone to await her death. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her sense of justice became dim. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She could no longer save anyone as her power faded.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She realised that she couldn&rsquo;t save everyone, that one must make a choice to give or take in the acts of kindness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everything seemed almost comical and pointless at that point.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Hehehehe, is this how I end? The weak are weak even at their deathbed.

How could you die with such selfish thoughts. What is justice? Is it really justice to fight evil for the rest of your life? I doubt it. Besides, what I am doing is no evil, so how could someone as insignificant as you make such judgement so hastily? There is no such justice in this world as to fulfill the free will of everyone.

In order to protect her ideal kingdom, a continuous effort and an unshakable resolve are both necessary.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata is also a double-edged sword.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If Ruminas is to become an enemy of mankind, Hinata will deliver her judgement with her own hands. Although it is mostly unlikely, she has still made such resolve.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why even to this day, she continues training to improve herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Without her noticing, Hinata has reached her destination.

She was supposed to meet someone that night, yet by divine order her previous schedule was cancelled. And so Luckily that night ended with the Holy Land undefiled. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At least, it was supposed to be.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You must be joking, right? Didn&rsquo;t Roy disguise himself as Demon Lord to attend the Walpurgis Banquet?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s true, Hinata. That invader you didn&rsquo;t kill ran into Roy when he returned before Ruminas-sama.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">How could this be.

Ruminas-sama ordered you to protect the holy land, not to exterminate the invader. That duty was supposed to be carried out by my useless Imperial Guards.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But I am supposed to be the head of knights among them&hellip;..

Upon birth as a vampire, he already had power up to Rank B. His body is highly efficient,with enhanced muscle strength, endurance, reaction speed and other, all several times stronger than an average human. In addition to this, over time he has obtained powerful skills, such as the vampire racial skills: </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Immense Strength</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Shadowstep</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Automatic Regeneration</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Paralyze</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Seduce</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Menace</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Transformation</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, etc. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The members of his race are few in number, but their combat capabilities are much higher than the average Greater Majin.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Vampires of high-ranked noble origin that are Louis and Roy have been following Ruminas since ancient times. The strength of the two are no joking matter, and Hinata fully understands this. Having once fought them herself, she knows that the strengths of the two are not to be underestimated.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words, the invader must have been very strong&mdash;&mdash;At least, that&rsquo;s Hinata&rsquo;s explanation of the incident.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;But, as long as Ruminas-sama is well, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any problem.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Said Hinata before she quietly adds: </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But there is no reason to ever be concerned for Ruminas-sama&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Demon Lord Ruminas is an entity beyond imagination- the limit of her power unfathomable, even to Hinata. Yet Hinata sees a possibility of confronting her at some point, as Ruminas is the supreme being that she ought to aim for as the ultimate target (to surpass). So it is in fact conceited of her to concern for the safety of Ruminas. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Roy on the other hand, to Hinata, is as worthless as a stone by the roadside. It may be unfortunate for Louis, but as far as she is concerned, Roy being killed is completely immaterial.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He died because he was weak.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">It was his own fault</span><span class="c0">, Hinata thinks to herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The problem may be more severe that you think. To this day we&rsquo;ve been having Roy running around to act as a threat in order to convince everyone to convert to the Ruminasism. With him dead, the humans may become less faithful to our doctrines. In addition, the Jura Great Forest has somehow become safer despite the revival of the evil dragon Veldora.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You have a point&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As she answers, Hinata thinks back to that slime she failed to kill. Her failure is likely the reason for this change .</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She has nothing to say about that. It was all due to Hinata&rsquo;s miscalculation, and she is aware of that the most. She may have intentionally spared the invader from last night, but Hinata really did plan to eliminate that slime called Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">How incredible. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that you actually escaped under those circumstances. I figured you&rsquo;d be rather cautious, but you far exceeded my expectations, &nbsp;Rimuru&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata gives her genuine praise to her enemy Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure about the evil dragon, but the forest probably &nbsp;became safer because of the slime called Rimuru. The one I failed to kill.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hmm. I did my own investigation too. The army from Farmus Kingdom was indeed eliminated. Taking into consideration the time of Veldora&rsquo;s revival, we can conclude that this was also the work of this being called Rimuru. He seems to be quite the problematic foe.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I first encountered him when he was caught within the Holy Purification Barrier (Holy Field). It was supposed to my best chance to eliminate him.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Did you go easy on him because he claimed to come from the same place as you?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No way. That slime&rsquo;s goal does not align with that of Ruminas-sama&rsquo;s. I can understand his ideology, but if we let him be, he will disrupt our plans. That&rsquo;s why I refused to hear him out and decided to destroy that town......</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The angels will probably strike them next.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yeah. Things may be fine now, but at the rate their town is being developed, the angels will definitely move out.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s troubling. We aren&rsquo;t prepared yet. I hope we will be absolutely victorious in the next </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Tenma Great War</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right. Those angels; you have to rip them apart to kill them. This advance in schedule would be most troubling to deal with alone.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Louis nods in agreement to Hinata&rsquo;s explanation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As soon as a city advances to some degree, it will be targeted by the angels for invasion. Their motives are unclear, yet their actions are always the same.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Once the great war takes place, countless innocent civilians will be sacrificed. Hinata has been strengthening the army reservation to prepare for such threat by aiming to decimate the angel army. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At the same time, she promotes the Ruminasism to unite humanity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata believes this is the way of advocating the will of the God Ruminas. And Rimuru&rsquo;s actions are hindering Hinata&rsquo;s plan.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In addition to her personal grudge against Rimuru after she caught wind of his killing of Shizu Izawa, Hinata has no reason to spare him any mercy. Hinata feels rather bad about involving conscientious, reasonable and friendly monsters into such conflict, but the holy will of Ruminas that declares monsters to be mankind&rsquo;s enemies cannot be defied.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Moreover, the most important thing now is to win the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Tenma Great War</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. Hinata would do anything so long as it minimizes human casualties. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is&mdash;&mdash;Hinata, the cruel rationalist. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But you failed your assassination. However, this may turn out to be quite useful.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What do you mean?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The Western Nations are likely to unite after hearing of a new threat emerging in the Jura Great Forest. Since Roy is dead, haven&rsquo;t they become the suitable candidate as the nemesis of humanity?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">...... Isn&rsquo;t that still up for debate? I doubt things will work out that easily.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">But</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Hinata thinks to herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It may be a good after all to switch her perspective a little. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If she is able to make peace with the Jura Great Forest and have them coexist with mankind, she&rsquo;d call that a good outcome in her book. But with that being said, if Rimuru really massacred the Farmus army, he will definitely become an unignorable threat.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I was supposed to meet that eastern merchant last night.

Those merchants have been trying to manipulate me. Now that I think about it, perhaps it was the right choice to spare Rimuru.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although it was quite upsetting to have not killed him, Hinata adds.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But, he is going to get his beating after sticking his neck out like that lately.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They made it through the Farmus invasion, but the revived </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would definitely threaten Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Moreover, it seems that Rimuru has declared himself a </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Demon Lord</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.As a result, the Ten Great Demon Lords are furious.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And because of that, he was summoned to the Walpurgis Banquet last night.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right.

You&rsquo;ve come a long way since last I fought against you. Right now, you have already surpassed the </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Seven Celestial Sages</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and are catching up to me. However&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">While you may be able to take down Demon Lord Rimuru, but you can&rsquo;t win against Veldora&mdash;&mdash;Ruminas asserts.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, Hinata. That evil dragon is truly powerful. He is the real Rank-Catastrophe threat.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With his many years of experience, Louis agrees with Ruminas.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is he really that strong?

He is the summation of natural energy. You can contain a frenzy storm using magic, but unlike natural phenomenon, that evil dragon has a will of his own. You can&rsquo;t kill him with your sword or magic. In addition, that guy would go on a rampage if you did so, sending shockwaves and highly destructive magic to shatter the earth.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As Ruminas speaks, one can easily see her hatred for him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Louis nods as she continues, his face strained; seemingly recalling some unpleasant memory.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It was a nightmare. He turned the beautiful Night Palace of Rose (Night Rose) into ruins too horrible to even look at&hellip;&hellip;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Stop thinking about it, Louis. That city was the crystallization of the wisdom and technologies of the vampiric race. Now only the memory of it lingers. There is no use in being nostalgic over something that no longer exists.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You are most right.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After seeing the two&rsquo;s reactions, Hinata finally realizes how dangerous Veldora is.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">&mdash;&mdash;But if things really do go out of control, I would still try.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata makes up her mind internally.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She also comes to a realization.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The reason why this </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Inner Sanctum</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was built on the Spirit Hill was to act as defense against Veldora. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;It&rsquo;s a precaution so that the constant surveillance can see him approaching if he does come.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And similarly, the reason why the real capital of Holy Empire Ruberios&mdash;&mdash;Night Garden&mdash;&mdash;was built underground, it is also to prevent the invasion of the evil dragon.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;It won&rsquo;t sustain much damage even if fights break out.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The enemy Ruminas holds such vigilance against is none other than the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">Veldora. (D: This is told from Hinata&rsquo;s perspective since she previously doesn&rsquo;t know)</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hinata, I don&rsquo;t want to lose you as well. You better behave yourself.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata can only agree given the extent Ruminas has gone to convince her.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The thing is however, her miscalculation during the encounter with Rimuru still troubles her like a bone in the throat even to this day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was her misstep to have ignored Rimuru&rsquo;s power just because he was a monster. She doesn&rsquo;t think her actions were wrong judging from the doctrines of the church, but it led to their current situation. Moreover, if she considers that it was all a conspiracy set up by the eastern merchants, Hinata would then have fallen right into their trap.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Annoying. It&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;ve seen through us to have released such information. Wait, could there actually be a traitor among us?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Despite her reluctance to think there&rsquo;s a traitor in their ranks, nonetheless, there may very well be traitors within the Church who have conspired with the eastern merchants. Then it is reasonable to assume that the traitors have also learnt about out preparations to strike against the angels. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve manipulated Hinata into assassinating Rimuru. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is a sensible theory and it makes it even more likely that there are traitors in their ranks. But she will investigate the matter later.

Those monsters are developing their city and constructing roads. These may lead to an earlier assault from the angels.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oh yeah, they are still out there. It would be quite annoying to be harassed by a bunch of Phthiraptera (flying lices), but, it would be even more troublesome to antagonize Demon Lord Rimuru and </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Veldora. Besides, the monsters are bigger threats to them, so the angels will probably focus on attacking them. So there&rsquo;s no use in &nbsp;worrying over it now.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Angels are nothing compared to Ruminas.

That new Demon Lord called Rimuru seems to want to build a kingdom where people can live comfortably. He mentioned that human assistance is necessary for that effort, and so he would protect them himself. He even declared that </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Whoever dares to get in my way, whether it is human or Demon lord, will all be my enemies</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">, right in front of all the Demon Lords.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ruminas sighs with melancholy after finishing.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">If only had he not reached out to the humans, we could have just adopted Louis&rsquo; proposal&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She adds on angrily. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hearing so, Hinata suddenly realizes that what Rimuru said about him being a reincarnated one was true.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But it is too late at this point. Hinata knows she has the problem of being too stubborn to listen to others&rsquo; opinions. Now her flaws have found the worst possible way to haunt her back.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">He doesn&rsquo;t seem to have realized that God Ruminas is Demon Lord Valentine. In the worse case scenario, I will just have to sacrifice myself. Hinata makes such resolves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">In other words, we can only quietly observe.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hmm, indeed. We should stay put and act natural to the public. It would only make the situation worse if we try to find excuses.

About that. Rimuru will probably respond to the so-called political consultation, so we should try have the Western Nations cover things up by giving a vague response. Would you agree to that, Hinata?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It may sound like a question, but Ruminas has already made up her mind.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, Hinata has no objection.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Alright.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You sound rather reluctant.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;A bit, because I still wish I killed him when I have the chance.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You are right to put it that way.

Nowadays, the eastern merchants who once worked as her informants are no longer reliable. Hinata believes that only intelligence collected by her own subordinates have credibility.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The time forwards to the present day.

Among the many more serious knights within the Holy Knight Order, Fritz is one of the rare informal individuals.

But Hinata calms all of them down.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">How very uninteresting, there is no time for in-fights now. Sare, if you wish to take my place, I can pass you my seat anytime. But before I hand it to you, I&rsquo;ll have to test your strength.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata&rsquo;s words silence the conference room.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is for the fact that her tone can no longer be described as annoyed, but instead expressing killing intent much more intense than annoyance. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Whoever continues to argue will be executed without question, and that is the absolute judgement from Hinata. The knights are not stupid enough to not realize the message behind her words.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata is usually very calm, and so, in moments like this when she displays her emotions, even Sare know that provoking her now would be dangerous.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Tsk! Don&rsquo;t you forget about your own words.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sare glares at Hinata annoyed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He was once defeated by Hinata.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Normally he wouldn&rsquo;t lose. To Sare at least, there was no way Hinata was better than him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet the result of their fight was a huge flop. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Having experienced his last defeat, Sare won&rsquo;t dare to make a move now. He doesn&rsquo;t have a chance in winning against her, as long as the secret to her power remains unseen by him. It would be a battle he has no chance to win&mdash;&mdash;Which is why Sare obeys Hinata&rsquo;s orders without complaint for now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After Sare settles down, the united conference can finally commence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I have something to report.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As she finishes, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Saint of Water</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Ritase stands up and begins her report. She was the one assigned to investigate the Jura Great Forest. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Jura Great Forest has been peaceful. It has not been affected by the revival of Veldora which is confirmed by the merchants going in and out of the town.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Tempest Federation is, in fact, often visited by merchants from Brumund Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The locally produced healing potions are very popular, and apart from that, people also want to purchase their silk products; not to mention their rare monster materials and equipments. That&rsquo;s why the merchants often queue up in the city to purchase the high quality goods.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">How can that be? Why would they do business with a Demon Lord?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">And Veldora, it is recorded that he&rsquo;s a warmonger who spreads chaos wherever he goes, yet right now there seems to be no sign that he&rsquo;s up to such business......</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some begin to raise doubts, only to be hushed as Hinata waves her hand dismissively.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Finish the report first.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She tells Ritase to continue the report.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Very well. I shall continue my report. I&rsquo;ve learned &nbsp;that the government of Brumund Kingdom has declared diplomatic relations with the Tempest Federation from the merchants. They&rsquo;ve also been given safe passage for the civilians to travel to Tempest with ease. In addition, the roads to the city has been dazzlingly clean, with not even a trace of horse manure. There weren&rsquo;t any sightings of monsters on the road either, so it would seem the said guarantee of personal safety wasn&rsquo;t just for show.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Have you explored the location?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes. In order to confirm things myself, I disguised myself as a merchant to visit the city. There were designated security personnel to maintain order in the streets. The level of development the monster town possesses has exceeded our expectations. And although it had a slightly concentrated magicule content, it wasn&rsquo;t enough to affect human body. It would seem they really do intend to be friendly to humans, just as Demon Lord Rimuru claims.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;Is that so? What about Veldora?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Y-yes, ma&rsquo;am. About that......</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What is it?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It is forbidden to enter</span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">The Sealed Cave</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">. I wasn&rsquo;t aware any other location for that the evil dragon may prefer to be...... So I wasn&rsquo;t able to find him.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hmm.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hinata hums thoughtfully and acknowledges the end of Ritase&rsquo;s report with a nod after she announced </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That concludes my report</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">There wasn&rsquo;t any sign of Veldora. Perhaps the rumor of his revival is fake news&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Saint of Wind</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Fritz opens his mouth to say something, he is stopped by Hinata&rsquo;s cold eyes. It shuts him up immediately.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ignoring the now panicked and apologetic Fritz, Hinata opens up:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The divine order is absolute. Anyway, we have now have information on &nbsp;Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s current movements. Next report please.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As she finishes, Hinata wants everyone to report the results of their own investigation as well. Before the conference, she had planned out the necessary information she wishes to learn in this conference.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;It would seem to be the case that the government of Ingracia Kingdom has been relatively settled. When comparing to its usual competitor, Farmus Kingdom, who has since fallen from grace, the power of Ingracia Kingdom is expected to grow.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The reports proceeds in order.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As the knights of the Pope&rsquo;s Imperial Guards, they can freely enter and exit any of the Western Nations. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They may even give orders to the Templar Knight Orders stationed in different nations. In terms of ranking, the captions of the Templar Order are still below them. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In fear of disrupting the chain of command, their home nation (Ruberios) cannot give orders to them without permission from higher authorities. But in case of emergency, the Pope&rsquo;s Imperial Guards can assume direct command the Templar Knight Order. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Given that&rsquo;s the case, their missions did not encounter any obstacles and were successful in gathering intelligence from the neighbouring nations.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is where the Imperial Guards differ from the Holy Knight Order. The Holy Knight Order is also free to visit the nations given its affiliation with the Western Saints Church. But they cannot give orders to the Templar Knight Order. There are also cases of members of the Templar Order joining the Holy Knight Order. One can only explain this as the structural difference between their organizations. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is why Hinata has decided to use the advantages of each organization when assigning orders for the convenience of gaining more information efficiently.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is now the last person&rsquo;s turn to report, which is Sare.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Alright, after hearing everyone&rsquo;s report, I have a rough idea of what boss is trying to find. Isn&rsquo;t my part the one you want to know the most?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right. Of course I was handed with the most important mission to you. Now do your report.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I see. Regarding the current situation of Farmus Kingdom, King Edmalis of Flamas has stepped down and it seems that the crown has been transferred peacefully. But, the new king, Edward, seems to be recruiting some powerful mercenaries. With him leading, the nobles seem to be doing similar things on their own as well. I think it is likely the precursor of a civil war&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The news of the birth of Demon Lord Rimuru has spread throughout of the Western Nations. But even if that was the case, the Brumund Kingdom, who has been communicating with Tempest Federation seems to continue grow more prosperous.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In comparison, the situation in Farmus Kingdom seems to be getting chaotic and abnormal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The nobles are like a plate of scattered sand, and many are acting to preserve their own power. Some are even attempting to reach out to the Western Saints Church and the elders within the Western Council. A civil war seems imminent.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The people of Farmus also seem to have been affected greatly. The price of goods has risen while the commodity flow stagnates (supply doesn&rsquo;t meet demand). Some have been conscripted into the army in order to fill the void of the twenty-thousand soldiers they lost. These newcomers have no combat experience, yet they&rsquo;ve been pushed to a desperate spot to have been conscripted. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words, these are all signs of civil unrest.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The the neighbouring small nations have all reacted differently, but they have one thing in common: that is to keep vigilant &nbsp;against the Farmus Kingdom. Sensing the change in situation, these nations have been tightening security in order to prevent themselves from being affected. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sooner or later there will be a war&mdash;&mdash;This thought must be on everyone&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;But this information alone won&rsquo;t be enough to determine Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s involvement.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I suppose that&rsquo;s true. Anything else?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve screened out the individuals to come into contact with the new King Edward. There have been important figures from the Council, high-ranked officers from the Freedom Association, as well as eastern merchants. He has even attempted to reach out to my subordinates.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What is his goal? Accumulating military strength?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Impressive; you are right with that guess, Miss Head Knight</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, we can conclude that the new king Edward isn&rsquo;t considering paying the war reparations. No Demon Lord would tolerate such behavior, and I doubt Rimuru is dumb enough to not realize this.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oh&mdash;&mdash;Then does this mean that boss thinks all of these are also part of Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s plan?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I suppose.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata nods.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">What a timing indeed. All of the intelligence leads to the same conclusion...... There&rsquo;s no other way around it, someone is manipulating things behind the scenes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Some of her doubts are confirmed as she listens to the report.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Who is behind all this?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There can only be one answer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since Demon Lord Clayman who was secretly active among the Western Nations have died, it leaves only one person to be behind such a scheme. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The newly-risen Demon Lord&mdash;&mdash;Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">How troublesome. Whether it is his personality (that I can&rsquo;t overlook) or his wisdom in planning out such comprehensive plan. He did mention he was originally Japanese, I suppose that&rsquo;s indeed true......</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata comments on Rimuru calmly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now that she recalls all these, all her problems have all been due to her trust in the words of the eastern merchants. Their many years of connection with her has earned them her trust, and she has taken all of their information in, which has been proven to be a fatal mistake. Hinata begins to reflect.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The worst thing is, most of their information was accurate. The only thing they modified was the portion regarding Rimuru that led to her misunderstanding. These small yet unverified lies have led Hinata astray. Had she believed what Rimuru said then, there may even be changes to how things would play out.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But there is no use saying such thing now.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata then suddenly finds a part of Sare&rsquo;s report to be concerning.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Speaking of which, Sare, didn&rsquo;t Edward have contact with the eastern merchants? Do you know what they discussed?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Why are you suddenly interested in the merchants? Aren&rsquo;t we done with this? We know it was the Demon Lord who&rsquo;s been behind the scenes? Now it&rsquo;s the time to discuss our future plans and how to react to the situation.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That part of discussion is, of course, necessary, but I am also curious about the merchants. So quit beating around the bush and answer me.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Tsk. Weren&rsquo;t those people only in it for the money?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No. They lure the unsuspecting into their scheme to profit themselves. Even I was also deceived and manipulated by them before. You all have to be careful in the future as well. So then, what have you learnt?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ho, I suppose they are really something to have manipulated a schemer like you. But, about that....... There wasn&rsquo;t something extremely important they discussed. Ah, hold on. Glenda, weren&rsquo;t commercial cities included within your area of investigation? Those places are where the merchants from east and west get in contact; have you got wind of anything interesting?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although Sare has a bone to pick with Hinata, he is still very responsible for his work. Then again, Sare has to acknowledge Hinata&rsquo;s strength. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She was able to train knights with poor skills into members of the Holy Knight Order. She had no mercy for monsters while also having her heart devoted to protecting the people. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Somewhere in his heart, Sare does approve of her.That&rsquo;s why he did the investigation, just as she ordered and shared the information he collected. He intends to take Hinata down from her seat, but he doesn&rsquo;t plan to pull the order back by any means. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sare believes in strength, and for better or worse, his personality reflects how he acts. Hinata is well aware of that as well.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then, Glenda&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Well, according to my knowledge, there hasn&rsquo;t been anything suspicious there.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She lies in a thuggish tone.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Glenda has led the life of a mercenary in the underworld and she&rsquo;s seen everything. Her instincts tells her that there is money to make out of the crisis brewing from these events. It is part of her principles to put belief and business as two seperate matters. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The public may think that she is a faithful follower of the Ruminasism, but that&rsquo;s not the case at all. Her real goal is the power wielded by the collective members of the believers of Ruminas all over the world. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That can be money, or information, or military force. There may be hundreds of variations, but every one of which is essential to Glenda. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her status now allows her to freely access all of these, so she can&rsquo;t lose her position. And it is for the same reason that Glenda didn&rsquo;t tell Hinata the truth. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In fact, Glenda did indeed visit the commercial cities Sare mentioned and got in contact with the eastern merchants. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In addition, she even attended a secret meeting with some prominent figures who can be considered elders within the Council. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her reward was money. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And the contract was to spread false information. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But right now there&rsquo;s still no time for her to do that as she must wait for the correct opportunity. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why Glenda is thinking to herself </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It would be bad if Hinata suspects me</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata is cruel and cold-blooded. She wouldn&rsquo;t spare mercy to her enemies. Glenda can&rsquo;t get careless while trying to find a way to trick her. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">On the other hand, she&rsquo;s quite nice to her comrades. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It would be a stretch to say comrades, it is more fitting to refer to the followers of Ruminas. She probably treat people who believes in the same God as her more like family than comrades.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Glenda has seen through Hinata&rsquo;s personality. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is for the fact that she is generous when treating her own companions that she allows Sare to constantly confront her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And it is why that she hasn&rsquo;t discovered Glenda&rsquo;s betrayal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">Because she treats her own men too good, Hinata will one day fall from grace due to her own personality</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Glenda thinks to herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Given this to be the case&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Since Miss Head Knight cares so much about it, I can go for a more detailed investigation.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is that so? Then I&rsquo;ll be relying on you. Please be careful and do not fall for those merchants&rsquo; words. Understood?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Leave it to me. I have my ways. So I shall get more in-depth information.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Glenda takes on the mission without hesitation in front of Hinata.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She is not self-aware at all, and her casual words have already revealed much to the Hinata&hellip;..</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She sighs internally after having observed Glenda&rsquo;s every move.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Seriously, I got looked down on. Or could it be that she thinks I&rsquo;m kind to my companions?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">If that&rsquo;s the case, she will be sorely disappointed.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hinata thinks to herself.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata doesn&rsquo;t see any value in companionship at all.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Glenda misjudged that point.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata is only cautious because she considers them as useful pawns to Ruminas. And she does so to prevent any damage to Ruminas&rsquo; property. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Holy Knight Order who has been trained by Hinata to serve as her left and right hands are all faithful followers of Hinata.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You may even call them Hinata&rsquo;s exclusive Knight Order with their absolute loyalty towards her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In contrast, the members of the Imperial Guards often act on their own. But since they also believe in Ruminas, Hinata is thus generous enough to keep an eye closed on their behavior. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sare is perhaps the best example. His conflict and constant provoking of her are all just acts for everyone else. Sare and Hinata are both aware of that. He may complain, but when it is all business as usual when it comes to work&mdash;&mdash;In some sense, Sare is very easily manipulated.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Besides, Sare is not aware of Ruminas. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Not only Sare, everyone except Hinata is unaware of Ruminas&rsquo; existence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">&mdash;&mdash;How pathetic. They are just as ignorant of the truth like I was before......</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata suddenly thinks.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Glenda is very ambitious. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">With her level of beauty and strength combined, she is very confident in herself. She must believe that she can take me down</span><span class="c0">, Hinata thinks to herself. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Perhaps she is even planning to win the affection of Louis. It is only natural for her to go after Louis to win his heart not knowing his identity as a vampire.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Whatever. She can do what she wants, but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As soon as she betrays the Church, it would be a different matter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata won&rsquo;t comment on anything the regiment does under one condition&mdash;&mdash;That they do not act to disadvantage her and Ruminas. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, now that Hinata is suspecting the existence of traitors, Glenda&rsquo;s acts are becoming problematic. But she may have just been manipulated by others, so Hinata doesn&rsquo;t plan to eliminate her immediately.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Anyhow, she can only keep an extra eye on her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">&mdash;&mdash;Speaking of which, they seem less disciplined these days. I need be more strict during drills to show them their place.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata feels rather troubled thinking so. But there are more important topics to discuss.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She changes up her mood and says:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Alright, everyone has finished their report. I assume everyone has been updated on the situation.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes. The impact of the revival of &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Veldora has been much less significant than we predicted. The only known casualties are the Farmus army who engaged in the war. But I think that it was probably a fake rumor released by Demon Lord Rimuru. The actual casualty rate should be zero.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, we will have to question the survivor, Archbishop Rayheim. We know that Veldora has been revived. So what happened on that battlefield seems to be more concerning.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Hinata&rsquo;s adjutant</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Reynald says so, Sare follows him up with agreement.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why we should call him in. He should be arriving anytime now&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata ordered Nicholas to summon Rayheim. Not only did Rayheim actually face defeat in battle, he also must have seen Rimuru himself. And so he is summoned to share his story and thoughts.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In addition&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The dates of Veldora&rsquo;s revival and the defeat of Farmus army seem to only be several days apart from each other. Although all the neighboring nations have been spreading the rumor that Veldora has decimated Farmus army, but in reality the timeline doesn&rsquo;t come close to align. It is for this reason that the factual testimony from survivor Rayheim is required. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rayheim is scheduled to arrive early this morning, yet he is late.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. There is no way to tell what kind of story we are going to hear. How exciting.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Perhaps it will be matters regarding Veldora&rsquo;s revival, he might have some insight into it.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">There has also been rumor that </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Demon Lord Rimuru negotiated with Veldora and successfully calmed him down</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">, but it is difficult to verify its authenticity. Veldora has been behaving himself since his revival. If that&rsquo;s true, the credibility of such rumor would also be higher.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Saint of Air</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Arno analyzes calmly.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone nods in agreement.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Everyone has come to some level of understanding that Rimuru and </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Veldora are connected in some way.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then there shouldn&rsquo;t be any need to hide it. Hinata concludes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She is referring to what Ruminas has mentioned&mdash;&mdash;the fact that Rimuru and Veldora are allies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;Indeed, that is true. I have to inform you all beforehand, God Ruminas has given the divine order that Demon lord Rimuru is capable of suppressing the </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">. For that reason, God said </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">You shall not take on Demon Lord Rimuru no matter what</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">. I hope everyone will keep that in mind. </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I-If that&rsquo;s the case......</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll be straight with you all then. We are staying low on this incident. We must not confront the Demon Lord directly.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The crowds see Hinata rise up and firmly declare so.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is to show that they&rsquo;ve officially proclaimed to not interfere with Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And so everyone is shocked in response.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is it really okay?! Are you telling us to do nothing while Demon Lord Rimuru continues his plotting in Farmus Kingdom?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Demon Lords are indeed difficult to take on, but aren&rsquo;t those words just for the public? We, the Ten Great Saints, will not lose to a Demon Lord!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is truth to Sare&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Humans are not completely helpless when confronting S-Rank threat like Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve long prepared the military force to face the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">People such as the Ten Great Saints, people who&rsquo;ve reached the level of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Sage</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Arno, Reynald and Grigori. The three would stand a chance against a Special Rank A monster. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Among the Ten Saints, Sare is undoubtedly the strongest next to Hinata. He wouldn&rsquo;t do too bad if he fights against a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c14">A duel between a Saint and Demon Lord like the legends tell is unlikely to occur. But if it really comes to that, we can have a good fight with our enemies then</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Hinata thinks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They have a rather good chance to win against opponents such as Demon Lord Clayman who&rsquo;s been tempting to make a move in the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, such judgement can only be made towards the (unawakened) </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Demon Lord Breed</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sare and the rest won&rsquo;t be able to handle a True Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is the most common of knowledge to Hinata, as she knows the truth about Demon Lord Ruminas.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And even Rimuru has also&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is rumored that large nations such as Farmus have summoned many </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Otherworlders</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and trained them for battle. Although such acts are largely criticized and prohibited by the public from a humanitarian standpoint, the enemies they fight are still monsters who pose threats to the whole of mankind. It renders such moral judgement uncompelling in the long run. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Farmus army consists of Head of Court Mages, Majin Larzen who can repeatedly reincarnate and the now dead Knight Commander Folgen. They were still defeated by Demon Lord Rimuru despite such military might.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In addition to Ruminas&rsquo; account of Rimuru&rsquo;s instant kill of Demon Lord Clayman, it should be clear that the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ten Great Saints</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;who only possess the title (of Saint), would not stand a chance against him unless they are truly able to achieve higher evolution to become a real </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Saint</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Like Hinata.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If the opponent right now is Demon Lord Rimuru, any of the nine Great Saints other than Hinata would not stand a chance. If that&rsquo;s the case, they should then prevent unnecessary casualties.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Besides&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But...by the way...... This time, there&rsquo;s also the </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on top of there being a Demon Lord. The situation may grow more chaotic if we make a move without planning.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reynald&rsquo;s calm analysis is straight to the point&mdash;&mdash;The Tempest Federation has the aid of Veldora.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is little chance to win even if they throw in all of the military reserves of Ruberios.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">We should just do it! We can&rsquo;t allow our territories to just be taken over by the Demon Lord!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The conference room quiets down due to Grigori&rsquo;s shout. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His words represent everyone&rsquo;s thoughts at the scene. Their eyes fall onto Hinata. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet with an uncaring expression, Hinata simply allows them to gaze. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The divine order of God cannot be defied. It is not within our power to defy.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">How can it be?! Are we to leave Farmus Kingdom to its own demise?!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s not the case, Ritase. There may, at most, be an outbreak of civil war in that kingdom. What we ought to protect are not the royalty or nobles, but the people. We should focus more on preventing the civil war from affecting the citizens of Farmus as well as other states.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What do you mean?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That kingdom may change its leadership, but if we are to intervene, it would be interfering in &nbsp;their internal affairs. Haven&rsquo;t they always been refuting our requests for them to stop summoning </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Otherworlders</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;with the excuse of </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">interference with internal affairs</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">? This will probably play out the same way.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata answers coldly with a smile.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Then according to you, are we not approving the actions of Demon Lord Rimuru?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Grigori questions Hinata.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right. Since Demon Lord Rimuru stated that he doesn&rsquo;t wish to antagonize humans, there is no need to continue our hostile approach. Not only did Archbishop Rayheim&rsquo;s attempt to eliminate Rimuru end in failure, but so did mine as well. There is a high chance of them listing us as their enemies if we continue this way, so we can only allow their actions in Farmus Kingdom.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But that&rsquo;s the misstep of Western Saints Church&mdash;&mdash;Or rather, you.

He begins to retell the course of events that birthed the terrifying new Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rayheim even spills all the bad deeds done by his own army despite no one ordering so. He flashes out everything he knows in a forceful drive of will. He must have been trying to rid himself of the pain and by doing so, is pleading forgiveness from God to atone for his sins.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even the Holy Knights are shaken by the details of his account of the birth of Demon Lord Rimuru. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The sheer combat ability of the enemy was shocking. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even their Holy Barrier would not be able to stand up against those light beam attacks, let alone the anti-magic barrier (or anti-monster) or the more commonly applied, defensive barriers that defend against wide-area magic attacks. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve never heard of such magic before. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They themselves are probably unable to stand against an attack that could penetrate their protective barriers.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But Hinata remains calm. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She deduces from Rayheim&rsquo;s report that it is likely an attack beam converted from gathered sunlight.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And soon her deduction is proven true&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hmm. That sounds a lot like Gran-sama&rsquo;s sunlight magic.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is it the kind of magic that bends light?

One of his skills can gather and concentrate sunlight.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although the magic that the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Seven Celestials</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are talking about should be different from this, Hinata thinks it sounds rather similar so her guess is likely not far from the truth.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Idiots. There&rsquo;s no way he used magic to directly bend sunlight. He must have utilized some other means to reflect the sunlight before converging them into beams. Perhaps he has borrowed the power of wind and water spirits? But if he wants to actually do so, he would need quite the calculative power......</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even if that is the case, Hinata is still not afraid.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If she knew the origin of his strength, countering it would then be a piece of cake. She would be able to stop the enemy&rsquo;s attack by summoning a protective barrier that dissipates heat and sprays dust particles into the air to disperse the light source. This attack is full of flaws if only utilizing sunlight. To Hinata, such attack isn&rsquo;t even worth mentioning.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">It seems like that he is using the scientific knowledge from the other world. In this way, he must think that it would be hard for the uninformed people in this world to deal with it. For him to have exploited the weakness of magic defenses... I see that he&rsquo;s not only cautious, but quite intelligent......</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thoughts are going through Hinata&rsquo;s head.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rimuru indeed possesses incredible calculative power and he is only made more of a threat given his ability to wield multiple types of magic at the same time. However, since Hinata has seen him in person, she doesn&rsquo;t feel the need to fear like the rest.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But, Hinata&rsquo;s conclusion seems to have been made too early.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rayheim isn&rsquo;t finished yet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s more story to tell&hellip;&hellip; or rather, what follows next is the climax.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Please hold on everyone. That mysterious attack was indeed powerful. Folgen-sama was killed almost instantly. Even Larzen-sama couldn&rsquo;t do a thing about it. Near ten-thousand knights probably all died due to that one attack. But&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rayheim pauses for a second.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There were people who either passed out or cried due to their severe injuries. Even those without injury were scared to insanity and hiding on the battlefield.

The silence is accompanied by a nervous air as everyone begins to recall a certain legend.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There was once a group of individuals who could single-handedly destroy nations. They became Demon Lords, and so, legends&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata also begins to recall. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She recalls what Ruminas said to her. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is rumored that the early concept of the Western Saints Church began to gain prominence around a thousand years ago. According to the history of the nation (Ruberios), there are records of it tracing back to around twelve hundred years ago. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It has been two thousand years since the old kingdom was destroyed by Veldora and the people immigrated to this location. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Veldora&rsquo;s stubbornness and immortal flesh were extraordinary and fighting him seriously would only further the destruction.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since the vampires could only obtain high-quality spirits from the blood of humans, if Velodora&rsquo;s reckless actions lead to humans&rsquo; extinction, it would also sabotage the food source of the vampires. It may be a different case for more ancient vampires such as Ruminas, but it is a life or death situation for lower vampires. That&rsquo;s why Ruminas had no choice but to come up with a system to coexist with them and thus devoted herself to the protection of mankind. She was raised to Godhood for her rescue and leadership of the humans in the past.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everything about this nation was caused by a rampaging Veldora.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was an existence far more persistent and difficult to deal with than any kind of natural phenomenon. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why he was called </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Catastrophe</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Right now they are called Special Rank S, i.e. not suitable for humans to handle. However...... He was not the only one that has caused mass-destruction.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Right now, the only individuals labeled as Special Rank S are the four </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">True Dragons</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. But that is merely a surface record for the public....... According to historic texts, there are also two Demon Lords who have also caused great destruction. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They are the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Lord of Darkness</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Guy Crimson and </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Tyrant of Destruction (Destroyer)</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Milim Nava.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All of the Demon Lords are listed as S Rank, but among themselves, there is also a difference of strong and weak ones.

Now that there is no active Chosen one however, the reality is that humanity won&rsquo;t stand a chance against them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The new Demon Lords &mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eight-Star Demon Lord</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;cannot be simply dismissed. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Demon Lord Rimuru is no exception. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">From Ruminas&rsquo; understanding, Rimuru seems to have also awakened. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rayheim&rsquo;s testimony just now is enough to prove that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Following Hinata&rsquo;s footsteps, the rest are beginning to recall as well. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;They are reminded of the fearsome awakened Demon Lords. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This information has not be disclosed to public to prevent unnecessary concerns over the existence of creature who threaten mankind. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The original </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">True Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Veldanava) has lost its power and there hasn&rsquo;t been any sign of its resurrection. One of the remaining three was sealed until it was unfortunately revived recently. And it has also allied with Demon Lord Rimuru who has become the focus of discussion right now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And speaking about this Demon Lord Rimuru, he was able to decimate twenty-thousand men army by himself. This kind of behaviour is quite similar to what the other two Demon Lords have done. It wasn&rsquo;t enough to amount to mass-destruction, but it is highly likely he has absorbed a massive amount of human </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Soul</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The solemn silence persists as no one wants to admit the fact that a new True Demon Lord has been born to this world. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The difference between </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Demon Lord Breed</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">True Demon Lord</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is night and day. Everyone at the scene is aware of this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No one is saying a thing, and the one to break the silence is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is it now? Then we will have to assume Demon Lord Rimuru has </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Awakened</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">......</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata states calmly.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her words became a sharp blade that pierced the silence. And so, the people who can no longer bear the silence found some motivation to speak as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I suppose we should. So what are wa going to do? If we leave him like this, won&rsquo;t he become a threat we can no long deal with in the future?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Calm down. Demon Lord Rimuru was once human as well. If he wishes for coexistence, then we don&rsquo;t need to force ourselves to oppose him.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed. We will have to see how they act first.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But, it is also a fact that he murdered twenty thousand knights without hesitation&hellip;&hellip; He is indeed dangerous. Can we really trust Demon Lord Rimuru......?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reynald was the last one to express his opinion, and the one whose opinion resonates with everyone&rsquo;s heart.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the end, all wars originate from suspicion and distrustful guesswork. If it is the case, when it comes to humans, it will be just as difficult for the Demon Lord to just take their word for it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It may be easy to do so if the knights can march on him at anytime, yet Rimuru&rsquo;s strength is growing rapidly. To the Guardians of Mankind, the Holy Knights and Sword of Pope, the Imperial Guards, it makes a lot of sense to challenge him before he grows to the point of being undefeatable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, Hinata is still not moved by it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Everyone, please stop. The divine order cannot be defied.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata declares with determination. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She won&rsquo;t change her mind no matter what she hears.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata is the head of knights within the Pope&rsquo;s Imperial Guards and the Commander of the Holy Knight Order. She must be a role model and rule the Holy Knights with determination in order to lead the Holy Empire Ruberios.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Unless it is to obey Ruminas&rsquo; will, Hinata will not change her mind.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Hinata is able to assert this without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As such, the united conference soon comes to an end. Everyone is supposedly going back to intelligence gathering as planned&mdash;&mdash;supposedly......</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet malicious intents linger in the air.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oh oh, Rayheim.

Yet now they&rsquo;ve actively intervened, trying to stop Hinata from ending the united conference.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rayheim takes out a crystal ball after being urged by these words.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He hands it carefully to Hinata.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">R-right, and this.

It is one of the many communication methods that &nbsp;work as better evidence compared to written letters, and so it is often used in communication between nations as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Putting aside the origin of such expensive item, Hinata immediately replays said message recorded by Rimuru himself. Since all of the prominent figures of the nation are all gathered here, they may as well get to learn about the Demon Lord Rimuru himself too.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, things are not that simple.......</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The crystal ball projects the image of a beautiful young girl.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No, not a young girl, it&rsquo;s Demon Lord Rimuru himself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His face is quite similar to Hinata&rsquo;s teacher Shizue Izawa, extremely grim and without any emotion. Although this is only a projection, his imposing aura is very evident.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">How surprising, he seems to have changed completely in just a &nbsp;few months&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata stares at him with eyes wide.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Soon, her eyes meet with the ones of the Demon Lord in the projection.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Could this be a coincidence......</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Unknowingly, Hinata begins to find herself nervous.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This Rimuru came from the same place as her and appears to be very friendly.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">Due to how strong this first impression was, I may have overestimated him too much</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Hinata remarks to herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The very next moment, almost as if hes is trying to prove her thoughts, he says&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I shall be your opponent.

I shall lead the troops to crush this ambition of the Demon Lord!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Arno, who&rsquo;s suddenly been filled with zeal, jumps out to volunteer himself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The crowd then restarts the discussion.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sare looks at Arno, quite shocked while commenting jokingly:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Arno, you may be good with a sword, but there seems to be some issues with your head.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;What did you say!?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Nothing really, but didn&rsquo;t boss just tell us to stay out of this? If we are to make a move, the other Demon Lords won&rsquo;t just sit back and watch. Besides, he may have awakened, so we can&rsquo;t be reckless. The best option now is to be cautious and accept his proposal.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, Arno. And there&rsquo;s still Veldora, who we have no chance to win against. In fact, we will suffer great losses even if we win. If they wish for a duel, we should just leave the matter to Hinata-sama.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ritase jumps in to support Sare.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If they and their troops are &nbsp;engage in an intense battle with their enemies, there will definitely result in heavy losses. And whether they can emerge victorious is also in question.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since this is the case, it is not a bad idea to send out Hinata, the strongest knight of Holy Empire Ruberios to fight alone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sare and Ritase both believe Hinata will be victorious, and for that reason they remain optimistic and support her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata is also reflecting on the whole issue.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Naturally, Arno&rsquo;s proposal to launch an assault is not an option.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It will drag the entire nation down with it, and in time, just as Ritase said, it will lead to a total war.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With further consideration of their geographical position, it will even endanger the Western Nations, turning this into a world war. If that&rsquo;s the case, Ruberios with much more subjects to protect will be disadvantageous, nor is it what Ruminas has wished for.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Right now, the biggest threat is, no doubt, Veldora. On just minimizing casualties alone, the invitation to duel with Demon Lord Rimuru is more than Hinata could wish for. Yet she still has doubts.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Then, what should I do......</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata begins to ponder.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Considering now, it was lucky that she didn&rsquo;t assault the monster kingdom when the situation had yet to clear up.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is all thanks to Ruminas&rsquo; wise eyes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no use sending any amount of troops when the opponent has awakened to be </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">True Demon Lord</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. Even with elite soldiers enlisted in the army, they won&rsquo;t be of much use if they don&rsquo;t reach a certain level of strength. The miserable state of the Farmus army to be left with only three survivors is sufficient enough to prove this point.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;No, that&rsquo;s still inaccurate.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Rimuru couldn&rsquo;t have been awakened during his battle against the Farmus army. He needed the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Souls</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">of the defeated Farmus army in order to achieve evolution.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He was able to take out the twenty-thousand men army when unawakened.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">What an absolute monster......</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thinking back to her battle with Rimuru, he didn&rsquo;t seem that capable back then. But there is also the possible explanation that he intentionally made a concession because the opponent was Hinata.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Would such a person be planning to kill her even to this day?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even if he does hate Hinata to the bone, it is still quite unnatural for someone seeking revenge to invite her to a duel.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And even though his motives may be to remove the obstacles posed by Hinata and the Western Saints Church, Rimuru shouldn&rsquo;t strike first. If he is dumb enough to not know this, how is it possible for him to come up with the scheme against Farmus Kingdom?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With that being said, there may also be another reason.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">It&rsquo;s quite strange, no matter how I think about it. Has the situation changed? Or perhaps, evolving to Demon Lord has deprived him of humanity&mdash;&mdash;?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A human&rsquo;s mind can be easily corrupted by such immense power.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For instance, Shizue put in much effort trying to suppress the power of Ifrit, whose enormous power can easily destroy a person.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover, the fact that Rimuru has awakened.......</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">&mdash;&mdash;No, there shouldn&rsquo;t be such thing. It wouldn&rsquo;t make sense for him to says that he is on the human&rsquo;s side if that&rsquo;s the case......</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ruminas mentioned that Rimuru announced his desire to protect mankind. Had he lost his humanity, his talk of building an utopian city would be nothing but claptrap.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is still not enough information, Hinata thinks to herself. She believes there&rsquo;s still truth hidden behind all this, yet her </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Mathematician</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;cannot work out the right answer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover, the message recorded in this crystal ball also seems weird.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It could have recorded a large amount of content, yet the actual message only consists of a short line of words. No matter how she puts it, she feels that there&rsquo;s some other intent hidden behind the message.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Apart from that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">Just now, </span><span class="c2 c14">&#12300;</span><span class="c1 c14">Sage of Fire</span><span class="c2 c14">&#12301;</span><span class="c15 c1 c14">Azu seemed to know that Rimuru had a message for me; why is that the case?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Rayheim only mentioned the origin and development of the whole ordeal, yet he didn&rsquo;t once mention a message from Rimuru. Yet Azu asked </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is that all the </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Message</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you have?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. Hinata finds that part to be abnormal. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Doubts begin to be raised in Hinata&rsquo;s heart.

His eyes are sharp and resemble that of an eagle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His dishevelled hair gives off an immense imposing pressure; however&hellip;&hellip;. a doll-like cute girl is also sitting on his lap.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She has smooth blonde hair and pink lips. It&rsquo;s a gentle-looking young girl around ten-years-old.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A formidable old man and a cute young girl; it&rsquo;s only natural to deduce their relationship of grandfather and granddaughter. Yet something appears rather out of place in this scene. However, no one questions this. It is simply deemed as natural as it is to the likings of the old man.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since after all, this elder sitting in the center is the head of the Five Great Elders, leader of the Rosso Family&mdash;&mdash;Granbell Rosso.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Rosso Family.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The family that built its strong roots in the Western Nations and owns all authority.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They also happen to be the royal family of Siltorozzo Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The members of their family has a hand in every powerful nation, including the likes of Farmus and Ingracia. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was also their family&rsquo;s contributions that led to the creation of the Western States Council.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">To the outside world, it appears that the Council elects its members from every nation. But they are, in fact, mostly members of the Rosso family. And their increased presence grants them enough prestige to surpass powerful nations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yuuki Kagurazaka&rsquo;s fund to found the Freedom Association also came from the Rosso. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If anything, these elders could be considered the rulers of the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And their leader is Granbell. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No one dares to object his actions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Granbell pats the girl&rsquo;s head as he speaks majestically:</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That would be good. But Damrada-dono, your lies seem to have been exposed.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He points out with a smile. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He is referring to the news Glenda has brought back that Hinata has found out that she was manipulated. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The man who responds is called Damrada.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He is fully clad in black with the edge of his hat covering his face. His clothes seems to possess a classy texture. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The type of clothes he is wearing are uncommon in the West; they give off an exotic feeling. But that is hardly odd, considering Damrada and his men are not from the Western Nations in the first place.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hehehe, don&rsquo;t worry. Hinata Sakaguchi may no longer trust us, but we&rsquo;ve gained more that we lost. That is your trust, Granbell-sama.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Surely you jest. The goal of </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">The East</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is to cause chaos in the West, so you can get better weapons sales. Are you not planning to have the empire attack after we exhaust ourselves from in-fighting? Your talk of trust is laughable.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Impressive, impressive. I&rsquo;ve been exposed, as expected from Granbell-sama.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Are you not going to deny it?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That won&rsquo;t help anyway.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Huh, you do talk the talk. Regardless, let&rsquo;s get to the more important matters.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Sure.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Am I right to say that it is our shared goal to eliminate Hinata?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Of course. The biggest obstacle that keeps the empire from marching onto the West is no doubt the </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Storm Dragon</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Veldora. Our sources have pointed out that the Demon Lord Rimuru has allied with that evil dragon. We can&rsquo;t be sure of the authenticity of these rumors, but the situation confirms that the evil dragon can be negotiated with. If that&#39;s the case, we&rsquo;ll try to communicate with it. The next obstacle that poses quite the threat would be the Western Saints Church. As long as that organization exists, the Western Nations will be united. If that&rsquo;s the case, no matter how powerful the empire is, it would be difficult to take all of the Western Nations down&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oh? Are you suggesting that we don&rsquo;t deserve your concern?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">My, where&rsquo;d that come from? The Five Great Elders are all </span><span class="c1 c14">practical</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;people. When the Empire takes hold of the Western continent, I hope you will continue providing us with your assistance. Let&rsquo;s collaborate and manipulate the world economy in the dark.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Collaboration? Do you want us to the pave way for the empire? Quit joking around.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hehehe, but the Empire is quite strong! It may be hard to attack the West, but there is still a chance we will succeed. Do you wanna make yourself an enemy of us when that happens?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">How dare a mere arms dealer be so rude to Granbell-sama?!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Surprisingly, it was Glenda, not Granbell, who reacted furiously.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She takes out her otherworld weapon from her pocket&mdash;&mdash;a pistol, and points it at the eastern merchant Damrada.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 635.50px; height: 903.66px;"><img alt="" src="images/image27.png" style="width: 635.50px; height: 903.66px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But Damrada remains calm. His calmness isn&rsquo;t because he is ignorant of the danger of the pistol. It is precisely because he knows its power that he is able to remain calm.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hehehe, a pistol, then? Bless my eyes. These things can even be found in the West now too.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Damrada speaks without surprise or fear. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oh, so you know about it? But why are you so relaxed then?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Of course I&rsquo;m relaxed. You really think that </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Otherworlders</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;are only in the West? We arms dealers should naturally know all sorts of weapons. Besides, the one you are holding is nothing but a common piece that has been successfully mass-produced.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Damrada answers uncaringly.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Five Elders couldn&rsquo;t help but express shock at this revelation.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What did you just say? You are already mass-producing this?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">As expected of merchants from </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">The East</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">. That&rsquo;s impressive.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, the empire&rsquo;s army would be strong beyond any measure. It may not be effective against monsters, but it is an invincible weapon against humans&hellip;...</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Elders all express their surprise.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Granbell also begins to consider Damrada&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This man called Damrada never lies. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">To be more specific, he often creates misunderstanding when he displays the opposite reactions to the magnitude of things he discuss. This man cannot be underestimated.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">To put it in another way, as soon as you scrutinize his words, you can find the devious messages hidden within.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;This time Damrada is warning them not to stand against the empire and that there are still plenty of benefits in collaborating.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Practical</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was a good compliment. You are right, it is in our interest to play along and assist you.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The rather imposing words of Granbell calms the Five Elders.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is it really okay, Granbell-sama?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Stand down, Glenda. We&rsquo;ve shared a common goal from the start anyway. It is not time yet for us to stand against them.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One does not defy Granbell&rsquo;s decision. Glenda stands down obediently.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In view of the pros and cons, Damrada&rsquo;s words do make sense.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Damrada&rsquo;s men are arms dealers, they do not want conflict with the Rosso who wish to control politics through economy. The two parties may oppose each other in terms of interest if the situation changes, but that&rsquo;s an issue for another day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hehehe, that&rsquo;s some wisdom I&rsquo;d expect from Granbell-sama. Although we&rsquo;ll inevitably become enemies one day, right now, we&rsquo;re comrades.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed. We don&rsquo;t wish to disturb the balance of relationship between Farmus and Ingracia. As long as some forces are present, the two sides can be on equal footing. We have no idea why Demon Lord Rimuru took down Farmus, but it would be problematic if the land is taken by the Demon Lord.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, I totally understand. We&rsquo;re in the same boat. It&rsquo;s so damn annoying how the trade route from Dwargon to Farmus has now been taken. And our previously ideal trade partner, Demon Lord Clayman-sama was also taken out. Demon Lord Rimuru is a thorn in both our sides. Please let us help. With that being said&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right, that seems to be the case. Hinata has followed through with Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s wish and has gone to the Monster Kingdom herself. Now we only need to provoke the Demon Lord to let him take revenge on Hinata.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s a well thought-out plan. But speaking of which, why do you want to eliminate Hinata Sakaguchi anyway? In my opinion, it&rsquo;s better if you just manipulate that saint&hellip;...</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Damrada looks towards Granbell as he finishes, likely trying to guess his thoughts.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet Granbell did not flinch and laughs it off with a question.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Huh, the reason is simple. It&rsquo;s all because that woman is too strong. Her title as the strongest knight of the west is not just for show. Even when you compare her to heroes such as the Majin Larzen, head of Freedom Association Yuuki or Shinning Yuusha Masayuki, that woman is still somewhat stronger. Aren&rsquo;t you trying to use us because you thought the same way? Am I wrong, Damrada-sama?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hehehehe, ara, Your Grace is indeed fearsome. You must mean to take out the pawn that cannot be dealt with or controlled. Makes sense.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Granbell and Damrada exchange looks and nod at each other. The two have similar personalities. That&rsquo;s why they can understand each other just by doing that. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then the two begin to discuss their duties as if nothing happened. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Damrada agrees to take care of the demon that&rsquo;s been conspiring within Farmus Kingdom. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">On the other hand, Granbell orders Glenda to mobilize the Templar Knight Order from the neighbouring nations around Farmus Kingdom and assist the new King Edward to push Edmalis, who&rsquo;s been supported by the Demon Lord Rimuru, to a desperate spot. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They will then leak the rumor that Hinata has marched on a crusade to eliminate Demon Lord Rimuru to curtail Rimuru&rsquo;s actions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rimuru will be unable to send reinforcements to Farmus if they&rsquo;re on guard against the Holy Knight Commander Hinata. And once the Demon General that&rsquo;s been leading the scene has been taken care of, the remaining party of Hero Youmu will be easy to deal with.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then the troublesome Hinata herself will probably be taken care of by Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But, what if Hinata Sakaguchi actually succeeds in slaying Demon Lord Rimuru? What&rsquo;ll we do then?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That would be nice too&hellip;&hellip;.. But be reassured, that Demon Lord called Rimuru is not like the others. We must take out this threat while we still have the chance. But right now he has allied with Veldora, so it won&rsquo;t be easy. I&rsquo;ll try to negotiate with them later.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hehehe, I&rsquo;m counting on you then.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right. I&rsquo;m in fact, counting on you with this one; don&rsquo;t fail in taking on that demon.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Certainly not. You&rsquo;d think the Western Saints Church has experts against demons, but </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">The East</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;has a far more effective special department for that.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s good.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Then, we&rsquo;ll head out first, do excuse us&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Damrada bows after Granbell nods, and then he leaves the room.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now only the Rosso Family and their guards remain.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After confirming it&rsquo;s all their own in the room, Glenda smacks her mouth with disdain.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What the hell was that? That treacherous profiteer! How enraging that he dared to look down on us!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Glenda goes on a tantrum.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Granbell glances coldly in the direction of the door and calmly comforts Glenda.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh, don&rsquo;t say that, Glenda. Those people may behave like that but they are actually sparing their highest degree of courtesy to us.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But, Granbell-sama&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Glenda, you have no idea what their true identity is. Surely Hinata has noticed as well: these are the grim reapers among the arm-dealing black marketeers. She didn&rsquo;t feel the need to look into because they still had some use to her before, but as soon as she learned their true identity, there was no way she would have let them walk free.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What do you mean by </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">their true identity</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Well of course, they are from the secret organization </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Cerberus</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">.

Yet we are still getting busier by the day. We still have to construct the new road that leads to Sorcerer&rsquo;s Dynasty Sarion and also plan out the new city construction project for Milim&rsquo;s group.

Ignoring our circumstances and are unwilling to hear our explanations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t think such actions constitute the true meaning of justice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Is Hinata really oblivious to such a basic thing? &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even though during our first encounter, she attacked without hearing me out first, yet she still doesn&#39;t appear to be that stupid&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So could the reason actually be due to the doctrines of Ruminasism?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Perhaps she feels like there is no need to listen to the opponents&rsquo; views since they are monsters. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Doctrines, to some extent, are beneficial and important, but by blindly following their doctrines, it truly does no good for anyone. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There has been too much bloodshed in the name of religion, it should be common sense to us Japanese people of this generation</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt54" id="ftnt_ref54">[54]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Isn&rsquo;t it important to see things and hear things for yourself before making judgement? Isn&rsquo;t it foolish to do the equivalent of giving up thinking by not doing either? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At the end of the day, whether or not the accumulated knowledge can be used is up to the individual</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After obtaining information, how should it be evaluated and acted upon; whatever outcome results is the responsibility of decision maker to bear. If Hinata chooses to stand against us, then we will have to send out our troops to fend off the enemies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet the stream of bad news has yet to end.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shaking my head, I try to readjust my mindset.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It can&rsquo;t be helped.

Even though there are only five people, their strength cannot be underestimated.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Anecdotally, it&rsquo;s always the carefully chosen heroes and their companions who manage to defeat a Demon Lord. This is the abiding principle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Becoming a Demon Lord is not my original intent, but I&rsquo;m not that kind to let them kill me without putting up a fight. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I will take on Hinata, and we&rsquo;ll have to decide who is going to handle the rest of the Holy Knights respectively. Bearing such thoughts, I plan to hold a meeting in order to discuss a plan, but then&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Rimuru-sama, I have something to report&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo spoke to me seemingly with discomfort written all over his face.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s wrong?

But I suspect that he was murdered.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At the time of when Diablo last saw him, he seems to be in a fine and healthy condition, which leaves only two possibilities to explain his death, either there was some accident or he was murdered.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Rimuru-sama even worried once about him getting silenced, it is indeed my miscalculation that lead to this happening&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The tone of Diablo&rsquo;s voice is filled with apology when he said so.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Speaking of, I do recall having mentioned it. Originally, it was just some cursory thought, yet it really did come true&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The event took place within Holy Empire Ruberios where communication is blocked by barriers, thus making the details of the incident unobtainable. But based on all the events that took place, Diablo thinks the likelihood of murder is very high.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After hearing this information, it turns out that the situation seems to be far more severe than I expected.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The neighbouring kingdoms to Farmus have begun to spread the rumor that </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">the Archbishop&rsquo;s death was caused by the demon&rsquo;s conspiracy</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">. This news has been broadcasted publicly through magic communication, causing the Templar Knight Orders stationed in many countries to mobilize. After several days of preparing, they seem to be on their way to rendezvous with the new king Edward&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo explains with a troubled expression.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Things have &nbsp;been developing unexpectedly, which means that Diablo&rsquo;s plan of taking over Farmus Kingdom must also have been disrupted.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata just moved out, and now this happens.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The two must be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Answer. It can be deduced that the two incidents are connected.</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hmm, I can totally recognize such simple pattern as well.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Do you think I&rsquo;m some sort of useless fellow who can&rsquo;t even see such an obvious thing?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No no no, that&rsquo;s surely not the case.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hahaha, even &ldquo;Wisdom King&rdquo;-san can be a troublesome fellow.</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt55" id="ftnt_ref55">[55]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But in any case, all these things are really giving me a migraine.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The Western Saints Church haven&rsquo;t declared us as the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Nemesis of God</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;yet, but if this is to continue, it eventually will happen. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Once they officially announce it, it will undoubtedly lead to all out war. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is our fault&mdash;&mdash;For thinking that they would give up so easily.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I simply wanted to focus our priorities on national development, but that seems to be impossible now.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And with melancholic thoughts, I order Souka to summon all the executives.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c10 c6 c35"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As such, we begin the emergency meeting. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone except Geld has arrived. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Rimuru-sama, is it alright to leave Geld out?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s alright. That he&rsquo;s busy working on large projects right now. This time, &nbsp;the conflict is between me and Hinata, so even if we break out into a fight, there is no need for the main troops to mobilize.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This isn&rsquo;t a war where we defend for the sake of our nation&rsquo;s survival, it&rsquo;s not right to dispatch a huge army against a small group of people.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Besides, in this world, there is no use sending in a huge army, it is useless in the face of an overwhelming difference of strength. The Holy Knights heading here are all powerful individuals exceeding Rank A. Without my lieutenants, this battle cannot be won.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Regardless, recalling all of Geld&rsquo;s subordinates now won&rsquo;t be easy either. I could use my teleportation magic but having them gather at a specified location at once will take too much time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are also the captives that need to be guarded, so I can&rsquo;t just suddenly give such reckless order.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone expresses their agreement . In order to share the information with everyone, I ask Souei to explain the situation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes, allow me to explain. First of all, the intruders approaching Tempest Federation is a group of five including the commander of the Holy Knight Order. All of them seem to be the figures of leadership within the Holy Knight Order and each possess great power to the point where they can even give my crew the slip&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The crowds gasp in shock.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Souka and the her companions are at least above Rank A, so it is quite apparent that their opponents must have been extraordinarily powerful to be able to throw them off their trail. Perhaps they could have kept up by flying, but that would likely have exposed their cover. It&rsquo;s still commendable that they chose the correct option of restraining. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover, a comprehensive security network has been established around the town, so Souei has already gotten a hold of Hinata&rsquo;s party&rsquo;s movements.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Control of information is the basis of strategizing. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is very important to obtain intelligence beforehand so we can use it when forging our battle plan so we won&rsquo;t panic when it&rsquo;s needed. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Speaking of which, Souei&rsquo;s skill in intelligence gathering is really something else. He uses techniques such as hiring an information dealer or engaging in infiltration using his </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Clone</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;etc.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I taught Souei the techniques of being a ninja, yet he has developed his unique style now. Even though he was surprised when I appointed him as </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Covert Agent</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt56" id="ftnt_ref56">[56]</a></sup><span class="c0">, it seems he is naturally gifted for the job. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover, having learnt all sorts of practical methods from Fuze, he has become a true expert in espionage operation. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If everyone is able as far as he has with just my questionable understanding of various matters, no one will struggle&hellip; Or so I convinced myself. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Souka&rsquo;s party was trained by Souei, and they in turn are training their own subordinates. Furthermore, They&rsquo;re even utilizing the locals to gather intelligence. &nbsp; &nbsp; Nowadays, even without my directives, they would collect information that they deemed important by themselves.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even now Souei is calmly explaining the situation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He has grown to be quite reliable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Templar Knights in countries neighbouring Farmus seem to be gathering around Farmus&rsquo; borders. Moving in small groups, they are able to travel at great speed.. Their numbers are estimated at over thirty-thousand. It seems they don&rsquo;t intend on interfering in the Farmus civil war, as their objective is &ldquo;to destroy the Demon&rdquo;... However at this rate, Youm-dono is unlikely to receive aid from the influential nobles or from other countries</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Annoyance emerges on Diablo&rsquo;s face upon hearing this.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He seems to be aware of this information as well so he doesn&rsquo;t seem surprised. However, the demon in question is no doubt Diablo, so he is likely concerned about where such information leaked from.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Still, thirty-thousand people is&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With each of the neighbouring countries dispatching several hundred or several thousand troops, once gathered together, it becomes a massive force to be reckoned with. One which simply cannot be ignored..</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Their logistics team could also transfer supplies in from the countrysides infinitely, so a war of attrition would probably be disadvantageous for Youmu&rsquo;s party.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is indeed a troublesome development.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;However the kings of the various countries do not seem to be in line with the Church and are not dispatching their own troops.. After all, the church seems to have several internal factions that complicates the chain of command. If we had a better understanding of their internal workings, we&rsquo;d be able to make a conclusion&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Souei says while slightly shaking his head, seemingly ashamed of the imperfection in his report.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Uh&mdash;&mdash;This is one complicated organization. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even Yuuki couldn&rsquo;t clearly explain its detailed structure, and most would just assume that the Templar Knight Orders are under the command of the Holy Knight Order.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Had I known about this, I should have gotten clarifications from Rayheim first&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo is troubled as well.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He mostly acts on his own deductions and won&rsquo;t ask for opinions from people who he deems lowly and unworthy. And this time that attitude has backfired.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right!

She seems to be quite jealous of her junior Diablo who was given such an important task.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Normally Diablo would rebuke her, yet he seems to have concluded it to be his own miscalculation and stayed quiet.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oh well, shall i try questioning Shion in his stead?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;Say, Shion.

By preserving the kingdom&rsquo;s ruling system and only replacing the leader, you can minimize damage as you slowly promote new policies. It is for this reason that such delicate work is best handled by Diablo who is both flexible and intelligent.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion is a no go.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I see, so it won&rsquo;t work after all&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">At least she&rsquo;s self aware enough to withdraw from the conversation quietly with her mouth shut after dejecting a </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t mention it if you know it won&rsquo;t work.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I thought to myself.

Anyone can take the easy route by resigning after taking on the responsibility! Besides, Youmu&rsquo;s relationship with me has long been known to the public. Diablo, you may be a Demon, but you are my subordinate too. I don&rsquo;t care one bit about what they are uproaring about, rather, shouldn&rsquo;t we be discussing about who is the culprit behind Rayheim&rsquo;s murder is? As long as we can prove that you didn&rsquo;t murder him, everything will be alright, so there is no need to complicate things.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I am a Demon Lord after all.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Isn&rsquo;t it quite normal to have one or two demons as subordinate?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed. Shion is thinking the same thing, she knows she can&rsquo;t take your place.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No, Shuna-sama. If it is me, I shall burn the Farmus Kingdom to ashes right away&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With a single glance, Shuna shuts Shion up mid-sentence. It was such a sharp stare that even Shion wouldn&rsquo;t dare to defy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;Which she has no intention of doing. Though it was rather tactless, that was just Shion&rsquo;s her way of encouraging you. You are one of us serving Rimuru-sama after all, so you shouldn&rsquo;t get dejected over such a minor mistake.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shuna&rsquo;s words are both gentle and strict at the same time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet Shion still decides to rebut this. It seems that she has a point that she has to respond with.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Shuna-sama, you are giving me too much credit. As the first secretary, I was merely giving this newbie a demonstration of my authority as </span><span class="c1 c14">senpai</span><span class="c1">.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She spoke with a smug look, but I can tell there&rsquo;s also a bit of fluster mixed in.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I see, it was indeed Shion trying to be encouraging. Although it is hard to tell, it does seem like something Shion would do. And Shuna indeed saw through that.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Normally Shion is always spouting muscle-brained stupidity, but occasionally she can be rather considerate.. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Well, it is what it is. Whether or not we send reinforcements will depend on our strategy moving forward. In the worst case, we can recall Geld, and I will go with him to the frontline.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Benimaru is also very attentive.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He doesn&rsquo;t mind the lack of numbers of his troops since he believes the tactics being employed are more important.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He proclaims with an aura of absolute confidence; as if it will not be a problem at all to take on the Templar Knight Order altogether.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How reliable.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;Then, it&rsquo;s okay for me to continue leading the operation&hellip;...?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Of course. It&rsquo;s going to take everything I have to deal with Hinata, so your job is to take control of the Farmus Kingdom. Besides, I was the one who authorized you to send out Rayheim, so I&rsquo;m partly to be blamed too. That&rsquo;s why you should spearhead this plan to conclusion. Or perhaps, are you saying it&rsquo;s too much for you? Then&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No, that&rsquo;s absurd! This is the duty granted by Rimuru-sama after all, please allow me to fully carry it out till the end.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Can you handle it?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Kufufufufu, of course!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Good.

Shouldn&rsquo;t we inquire from him? It may have been hundreds of years ago, but he has, after all, spent much time in the Western Saints Church.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Speaking of which, this Adalman is&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Answer. He is the one guarding Clayman&rsquo;s castle&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oh oh! He was the undead monster who became Shuna&rsquo;s companion.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I recall that he became a Wight</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt57" id="ftnt_ref57">[57]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;after losing his life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I met him once before where he went on a tangent about his gratitudes towards god. I suspected that he&rsquo;s the type with a severe case of delusional disorder. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Indeed, since Adalman was once a member of the Western Saints Church, he may indeed know something about the organization. There are probably many differences comparing between then and now, but, we don&rsquo;t stand to lose anything by just talking to him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s a good idea. Let&rsquo;s have a chat with him.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As such, we should call him over immediately.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Currently Adalman is assisting Gabil with conducting research in the sealed cave as well as standing in for guard duty. To summon him, Gabil used </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Telepathy Net</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to contact and informed him to come here immediately.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Adalman immediately showed up, seemingly with the use of teleportation magic directly transporting him from inside the cave to town. Even though he has devolved into a wight, he is still proficient with magic he mastered in his past life, some of which seem to be very high level spells as well. In other words, his magicule reserves may have dropped to around Rank B, but his overall power still cannot be underestimated. With his intelligence and powerful magic based techniques combined, we may have to find a better job to offer him. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But, he still just looks like a skeleton from the outside&hellip;..</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover, Adalman&rsquo;s subordinates cannot be exposed to sunlight, nor can they talk. It may be ok to try and communicate with them, but it would be difficult for them to work in the town.</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 640.99px; height: 912.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image29.png" style="width: 640.99px; height: 912.50px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ll think about that later.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Anyways, right now we need to chat with him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;My most sincere gratitude to your grace for having granted me an audience&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Too lengthy!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">While I was planning out Adalman&rsquo;s future, he had been expressing his appreciation of me the entire time.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He doesn&rsquo;t seem to stop even when ignoring all of his complements. So I have to raise my voice to shut him up.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It seems we have yet another intense fellow join us. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You are a promising fellow!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The rest of the executives seem somewhat alerted at how satisfied Shion looks when she nods to Adalman as well as how Diablo is looking at him with a gentle smile.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s stop that for now, Adalman. I know you are elated about the fortunate opportunity to have an audience with Rimuru-sama. But we are running short on time, so let&rsquo;s get to the point.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Had Shuna, who&rsquo;s also quite baffled, not stopped him, Adalman would probably have continued with more of my praises.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His strong will has all been applied to his faith, no wonder he&rsquo;s so earnest. I feel strangely impressed within all this weirdness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Next, according to Adalman&rsquo;s explanation&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It turns out this Adalman used to be in the highest echelons of the Western Saints Church, holding the position of Cardinal. At the time, the Western Saints Church was in a weaker state and wasn&rsquo;t as prominent within the Holy Empire Ruberios as it is now. But we still learnt some detailed information on the organization. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">First we learnt about the Holy Empire Ruberios as a nation. They are a theocracy that holds the God Ruminas as their deity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The pope acts as the spokesman of god, whose real identity is unknown. Perhaps the position is passed down over years, but there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any rumors of such. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is an organization named the Pope&rsquo;s Ministry that runs the country. This organization serves as the highest executive body within the Holy Empire Ruberios. Adalman recalls during his time, the Western Saints Church is but a lowly sub-group under the Pope&rsquo;s Ministry.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The Western Saints Church was formed to promote Ruminasism. It is an organization that is specifically used to promote the religion. However&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This alone was not able to ensure the personal safety of the missionaries. That&rsquo;s why the Pope&rsquo;s Ministry made demands to the nations under their protection and formed the Templar Knight Order. The nations welcomed the idea of a Ministry funded knight order, and so they agreed to assist.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is a guarantee of the safety for citizens among these nations since now, the believers are protected from the threat of monsters. And since the funding comes from other people, anyone would normally agree to such terms. After establishing the foundations, disputes began to emerge between Ruberios and other nations. And it was then that the Pope&rsquo;s Imperial Guards entered the scene.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">In name, it&rsquo;s a military division, yet the members of the regiment only consist of a couple of people. They are all extraordinarily powerful individuals who have the authority to directly command the Templar Knight Order. These people only pledge their loyalty to their god and the pope, and so even the Archon, who possesses the highest executive authority within the Pope&rsquo;s Ministry has to be very respectful when dealing with them.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The archon seems to be the one in charge of political affairs. If the Imperial Guards wields such enormous authority to the point that power holders like the archon can&rsquo;t even order them around, then it is apparent that they are a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">About that, my friend Albert also received the honor of being allowed to join the Imperial Guards, yet he declined to become my adjutant in the Western Saints Church instead. Later the pope granted him the title of Knight Paladin.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Adalman smiles proudly as his skeletal jaws bump into each other, making </span><span class="c15 c1 c14">*spooky skeleton sound*.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I see, so that was the Undead Knight who even gave Hakurou a tough time&mdash;&mdash;Now he has become a skeleton swordsman, it is no wonder that he has become so strong as he has received a monster&rsquo;s body on top of his masterful swordsmanship.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;But, the situation now seems to have taken a complete one eighty.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oh, Adalman isn&rsquo;t finished yet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The changes do seem drastic according to his explanation.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The biggest difference lies in the fact that the Church has become much more powerful. Its authority has increased with the addition of the Holy Knight Order.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Moreover, the role of archon in the ministry is now given to a selected cardinal from the Western Saints Church, resulting in their greatly increased authority. The reason for which must have been the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Seven Celestial Sages</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When Adalman was around, the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Seven Celestial Sages</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;were powerful figures rivaling the Pope, who also act as the archons. The </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Seven Celestials</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;initiated the changes of selecting the archon from the cardinals after receiving orders to revive the Western Saints Church. But the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Seven Celestials</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;don&rsquo;t seem to be a group that can be easily dealt with. It seems that they are the ones who had set up the traps that eliminated Adalman&rsquo;s party.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He seems to dislike the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Seven Celestials</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a lot.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The Holy Knight Order wasn&rsquo;t anything impressive while under the supervision of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Seven Celestials</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. They&rsquo;ve only become an organization worthy of the name strongest knight order after undergoing Hinata&rsquo;s training. It is for that reason, the Holy Empire Ruberios came to have the two pillars of the Pope&rsquo;s Imperial Guards and the Holy Knight Order.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That was quite detailed, Adalman. I see that you have a very good source of information despite staying with Clayman&rsquo;s this whole time&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Demon Lord Clayman sees an enemy in the Western Saints Church. He has been cautious of their forces and been diligently collecting information. I was a lieutenant under him after all, though he does not ask for my opinions, he would still give me information.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I asked out of doubt yet Adalman answered while giggling.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So that&rsquo;s why, I get it now. It is quite unexpected, but Clayman&rsquo;s manipulative and calculative side actually helped us.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rimuru-sama, my God, please be extra cautious. Now that the Holy Empire Ruberios has the </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Ten Great Saints</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">, they are all individuals at the level of </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Sage</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">. Even Demon Lord Clayman has treated those people with caution, please do not be careless.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As such, Adalman&rsquo;s explanation concludes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We were not informed of the details, but the Imperial Guards have members who are called the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Three Martial Sages</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, they are all masterfully skilled fighters who reached the level of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Sage</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">. Apart from them, there are in total ten people including the the six Holy Knights and their commander Hinata. They are known as the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ten Great Saints</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Rumor has it that a</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Saint</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">can rival the likes of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Demon Lord Breed</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. It is then no wonder why Clayman wouldn&rsquo;t dare act carelessly in the presence of these ten people.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is likely that other than Hinata who is heading straight to our nation, the other four are also members of the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ten Great Saints</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">. That&rsquo;s why sending out normal troops would only cause unnecessary casualty meaning it&rsquo;s more appropriate to directly have myself and my lieutenants to deal with them. Moreover, judging from the movements of the Templar Knight Order, the Imperial Guards are likely on the move as well. This can be explained if we consider the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Three Martial Sages</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to be acting independently.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">My God, I, Adalman, was once a Cardinal. Allow me to go persuade this Hinata! I shall convert her into believing in Rimuru-sama as well&hellip;&hellip;..</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ah, stop right there.

For some odd reason, his magicules have increased dramatically, and I worry he&rsquo;s &nbsp;lacking in exercise lately.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">My master, am I to be sent to battle?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed. It&rsquo;ll be good for you to work out every now and then.

My body feels much lighter. I look forward to exercising after waking up.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What&rsquo;s that?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Things are going to go horribly wrong if I let him out! &mdash;&mdash;I suddenly get this dangerous feeling.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nevermind, since it&rsquo;s not me who will suffer the consequences. Things are probably going to go horribly wrong for the enemies.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s very reassuring now that Ranga-san is with me!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And so Gobta is truly motivated this time. What a practical guy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ranga, don&rsquo;t overdo things and accidentally kill your opponents&hellip;....</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No problem! Shion-dono has taught me the art of holding back!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I-I see&hellip;&hellip;...</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m even more concerned now. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I thought he has just been sleeping in my shadow this whole time, but as it turns out he&rsquo;s been up to no good when I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention. The fact that he mentioned he has learnt something from Shion makes me feel uneasy. But there shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem as long as we have healing potions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At that moment, Ranga howls delightfully and lied down next to Gobta. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I can only pray for the safety of their opponents.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t help but cheer for the enemies who I&rsquo;ve never met. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Good luck!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">But I&rsquo;ll keep it a secret.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Benimaru doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any objections with my decision. Though,</span><span class="c1 c14">You are spoiling Gobta too much</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;seems to be what the smile in Benimaru&rsquo;s eyes entailed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As such, I approved Benimaru&rsquo;s plan and the troops to be dispatched have been decided.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now then, the problem now is those that will be reinforcing the new King&rsquo;s (Edward) forces.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Then Diablo, how do you plan to deal with your attack plan?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed. I&rsquo;ve expected there to be reinforcement troops, but thirty-thousand is a truly surprising number. According to the original plan, I only estimated the new king&rsquo;s total force to consist around ten thousand soldiers&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo continues to explain&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">First, he instructed Edmalis to ask around and find out the reason the new king is gathering soldiers. Since he has assumed that the new king is only doing so as a precaution since he wanted to push the responsibility of the reparations onto Edmalis.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This way, the new king can argue that he has no need to fulfill the treaty signed by Edmalis. This method, although futile when dealing with the Council, lands on a grey area for dealing with us. He is going to execute Edmalis and claim the treaty to be invalid. And in doing so, when we are provoked to send out our troops, he will (then be justified in) gather the Western Nations to stand against us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In order to prevent such things from happening, Youmu&rsquo;s party has to go and rescue Edmalis, who has been trapped in this difficult position.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Right now Edmalis is under Youmu&rsquo;s protection and they are hiding in Nedler&rsquo;s territory. Everything seems to be going according to plan up to this point. Youmu is using Nedler&rsquo;s territory as his base and has gathered a force of around five thousand men. In addition, I will be sending four thousand three hundred men all at once with teleportation magic. Not only are they almost equal in number, the sudden appearance of this huge army would also strike confusion into the enemies&mdash;&mdash;We intended to crush the enemies using psychological warfare.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now that the new king has gathered reinforcement, this tactic is no longer viable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We waited quietly for our opponent to reorganize and now the situation has turned into forty-thousand versus ten-thousand&mdash;&mdash;Our opponents&rsquo; forces have grown to be four times as ours. It seems we will need to hurry things up.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s why the new king Edward has established his camp in Edmalis&rsquo; domain in order to wait for the reinforcement.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Diablo&rsquo;s explanation concludes there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The plan was supposed to be for us to defeat Edward in this fight and for Edmalis to announce his decision to continue abstaining the throne so the Hero Youmu will be crowned.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right now Edward has gathered around twenty-thousand soldiers. In three weeks&rsquo; time, he will have gathered forty-thousand. If that&rsquo;s the case, the lackluster defenses of Nedler&rsquo;s territory wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Souei added on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The situation would only get worse if we continue to wait.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If we send out our troops, it will become a real bloodbath. They&rsquo;ve already lost twenty-thousand people before, and now with a battle like this, Farmus Kingdom would likely take a fatal blow.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then, what should we do&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;This is horrendous. Perhaps we should just give up this time. If I just forgo rest the of the reparations, then there would be no more war right? They won&rsquo;t be able to continue the fight if they lose their justification.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No way! They will look down on Rimuru-sama if we do that.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It is indeed unsettling to be looked down on, but we have already profited from this whole ordeal. Shouldn&rsquo;t we aim to resolve the issue with Hinata first before rehashing our plans?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In fact, we&rsquo;ve already obtained parts of the astronomical reparations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If we stopped right now it would still benefit us as the risks of continuing combat would be too high.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A Demon Lord is supposed to be the boogeyman after all</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt58" id="ftnt_ref58">[58]</a></sup><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;what Shion said does make sense&hellip;....</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Kufufufufu, how can we abandon the operation now.

The four knights chasing after her seem to have travelled at full speed with magic applied even. But as soon as they rendezvoused with Hinata, they slowed to normal speed as well. The two parties seemed to have argued over something, but they ended up moving together anyways. The five are making their approach to our town as one groupy. As of now, they are making their way from the Kingdom of Ingracia to the Kingdom of Brumund, however, they are moving rather slowly, meaning that the hundred knights behind them will eventually catch up.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet the troops behind Hinata&rsquo;s party seem to be avoiding open roads, and it would appear they are abandoning their rides to take old forest paths.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Sound like they are not planning on meeting up with Hinata.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Their goal is unknown to us. We predict that Hinata would not be arriving in at least two weeks&rsquo; time, and the troops behind her will be arriving around the same time as her.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Souei didn&rsquo;t forget to have someone to shadow them in midst of all this confusion.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I can only wait for follow-up reports on that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Just as we&rsquo;ve overcome one problem another emerged. No, I should say that one problem is followed by another.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How annoying, truly.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All in all, the situation has changed.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sighing won&rsquo;t do us any good.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My executives begin to discuss again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I listened to how they plan on dealing with the situation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are five individuals who are at the level of Sage including Hinata. There&rsquo;s also the hundred or so Holy Knights trailing them. This regiment of around a hundred knights are far more dangerous than the Farmus army of twenty-thousand. Or rather, Hinata, in particular, is extremely dangerous.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is the unchanging rule of this world.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The quantity of military force cannot rival the quality of individual strength. No matter how many thugs and lackeys you gather, you cannot win against the overlords of this world. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t intend to engage them alone this time, such act would undoubtedly be suicidal.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">So what should I do?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s just stop thinking and kill them all!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll leave the speaker of this statement unspecified, but really, whoever is the most airheaded is also the strongest. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Without considering practicality and going straight to the result;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is because of this level of recklessness that her unique skill was awakened.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">If only Geld is here at time like this&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That guy has his own work to worry over. Unless things get really dire, we should just deal with it by ourselves.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hakurou and Benimaru&rsquo;s exchange is very ear-catching.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Could you stop being so stubborn and just ask Geld for help?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But there are only one hundred and so opponents. So it is meaningless to dispatch a huge army. And honestly speaking, my lieutenants will have to engage in battle anyway.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I will take care of Hinata while the remaining four would have to be dealt with by the others.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If Hinata is willing to fight me one-on-one then it won&#39;t be a problem, but for me to take on all five at once definitely would be a bit too reckless on my part.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Answer. There is no problem. The only opponent requiring caution is individual </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hinata Sakaguchi</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">.</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oi&hellip;....</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No no no, that is the biggest problem of them all!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Are you okay? I feel like you are less reliable than the times of when you were still</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Great Sage</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">.......</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Essentially, the reason for my concern is that I don&rsquo;t wish for any casualty to occur. We are guaranteed victory if we attack the Holy Knights with sheer numbers to tire them out. However it will be at the cost of heavy casualties. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It took everyone so much effort to survive till this day, it would just be dreadful to have a pile of casualties at this point in time. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, our opponent is Hinata. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That woman is extremely dangerous. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">During our last encounter, I focused entirely on escaping since taking her on seriously would surely lead to my demise. Besides, she wasn&rsquo;t even using her true strength at the time. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Right now the only person who can deal with Hinata is me. I don&rsquo;t think I would lose if we are to duel each other one-on-one, but it&rsquo;s a different story if all the Sage level Holy Knights attack at the same time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I would probably get myself killed if I pretend to be a guru and became too overconfident about my skill. Moreover, the other hundred or so Holy Knights are also a problem as well. I have no idea how to deal with them&hellip;&hellip; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If Hinata came to negotiate, there&rsquo;s no need for her to bring so many troops. There is no way these suspicious events occurring would not cause others to be on alert </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Alright&mdash;&mdash;I&rsquo;ve come up with an idea! How about you let me try my dragon breath sometimes? I can make it look just like an accident by pretending no one was there!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Could you shut up for a moment? Last line of defense means you only get to fight at the last moment!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Veldora&rsquo;s suggestion sounds like a child&rsquo;s prank, and so I reject the idea immediately.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If Hinata indeed came to negotiate with me, it would ruin any opportunity for us to talk. Moreover, there is no way of knowing what sort of damage his dragon breath would cause, how horrifying.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It would be fortunate for us just to not give Veldora any chance to fight. But if we intend to strike first and eliminate them, it would be a viable proposal. But it will still depend on what our opponents would do. Yet it is also not ok to just ignore them. Since there are more than one Holy Knights, there&rsquo;s a risk of them casting </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Holy Purification Barrier</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;around us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t simply ignore them, and killing them would also be a problem.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Holy Knights&mdash;&mdash;They are equivalent to the guardian of mankind. They are knights blessed with the protection of the spirits.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In this world, the damages caused monsters cannot be overstated and not everyone has the spare money to hire adventurers. which is why everyone lives in fear on a daily basis. The knights who protect these villages and towns on the fringes are those trained by Hinata herself. There are many who were saved from the monster attacks by them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These survivors relies spiritually on Ruminasism, and physically on these members of the Holy Knight Order whose strength are also top-notch. Many of them are powerful individuals who exceeded Rank A. We will suffer serious losses if we directly confront these knights.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;s not the main issue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There will be consequence in the future if we were to straight up kill these knights who carry the prayer, hope and expectation of the weak. That is the main issue. We may still have room for negotiations if the doctrines of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Monsters are the common enemy of mankind</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t a thing&hellip;... &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But I&rsquo;m not giving up hope despite the difficulty of achieving it this time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">To them, we are evil creatures who cannot be reasoned with. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But these thoughts are not hard to understand. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After all, some of them are survivors from villages that were wiped out by monsters, or orphans whose parents were murdered by monsters. Being deceived would lead to their deaths and it wouldn&rsquo;t simply mean their death, but also the death of those who rely on them for protection.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover, it is also a fact that there are still maniac monsters out there causing mayhem. The incidents of monsters causing harm near our nation has indeed decreased. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But there are still monsters being born in other locations and causing destruction. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If we are to kill all the Holy Knights here, who will be protecting those fringe districts? Upon thinking over it, I feel there&rsquo;s a need to avoid killing them so casually. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Perhaps we could have avoided this misunderstanding if I could have reached Hinata back then. It is regrettable that she wasn&rsquo;t willing to listen to me because I am a monster.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since Hinata is a stubborn blackhead too.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She even went so far as to dispatch combatants after seeing my message.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Suspicion detected. Certain events do not seem like a natural outcome regarding the matter. It can be deduced that the Likelihood of this not being Hinata Sakaguchi&rsquo;s intent is extremely high.</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Eh?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Could this mean that, we still have chance at negotiating?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There should be many ways for us to defeat them if they are truly considering us to be enemies. But right now we are concerned about what&rsquo;s the right thing to do is since it is unclear how our opponents are perceiving us. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All in all, these are all excuses that I&rsquo;ve been pondering over&hellip;&hellip; But it is main reason for that is I don&rsquo;t wish to kill Hinata myself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shizue-san was also worrying about Hinata&rsquo;s later development. Since I&rsquo;ve inherited her will, I don&rsquo;t wish to fight Hinata to the death without even talking to her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How troubling, but I&rsquo;m only so troubled because Hinata is too stubborn. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What am I worrying about, sheesh. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Regardless, if we can&rsquo;t negotiate, then a clash would become inevitable&hellip;&hellip; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It will be disadvantageous for us if it comes to that. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Our opponents are experts in monster extermination. So we can&rsquo;t just bash our way through. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is one thing that&rsquo;s for sure though, I hope to minimize casualties on both sides. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what our opponent wants, we will just have to prepare for the worst.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If the negotiation fails, I will have to fight Hinata once and for all. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I also mentioned this in my message, so there shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue with that part. Our opponents may be planning to have a grand confrontation with everyone they have, but this is our territory. If we are to set up a trap beforehand, we may be able to buy some time during my confrontation with Hinata.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even though it is troublesome, it still has to be that way.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right, I&rsquo;ve made up my mind!

The outline of this plan that isn&rsquo;t even worthy of being called a battle plan. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All of my executives are now brainstorming to check for any oversights of this operation.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I on the other hand, close my eyes to predict Hinata&rsquo;s movement once more.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The calculation of Wisdom King Raphael-san has also predicted that this plan would minimize casualties, so I don&rsquo;t think it warrants anymore concern. But there is something I am still worried about. It would make a better battle plan if I abandon the operation to take over Farmus or by calling Geld back. But I didn&rsquo;t do either and adopted the current plan out of my own selfish thoughts.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I need to ensure it is a perfect plan that guarantees our victory. &nbsp;It will be no problem if Hinata is willing to negotiate. If not, we will duel each other until one of us falls. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This plan may seem to be waterproof with our arrangement, yet it has one fatal flaw.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If I am defeated by Hinata, all of these discussions would be worthless. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, Wisdom King Raphael-san thinks I will be the winner. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With that being said, if I am defeated this time, our operation would be completely blown.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Would the calculation of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Wisdom King Raphael</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;be truly reliable?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I always have the feeling that it is too confident&hellip;&hellip; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rather, it has too much faith in me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Raphael-san, are you overestimating me too much? &mdash;&mdash;I always have such uneasy feeling. However, I will have to force myself to charge onward. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Just like I did until this point, and how I will in the future as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even if do not have one hundred percent confidence in myself, my companions still believe me.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, I will no longer hesitate and keep on moving.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll say this one more time. If the battle plan is hard to maintain once we actually start fighting then you should eliminate your opponent immediately. The lives of our companions are the most important. Know that you are done for if you get killed. So I hope everyone will be able to make it through this ordeal safely as well!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes sir!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It would be counterproductive if we get any of our companions killed trying to avoid harming the Holy Knights.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I have to get this point across.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Seeing that everyone has responded, I nod with satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Next.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We wait for Hinata&rsquo;s next move&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata has successfully arrived at Tempest Federation. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The journey has been just average travelling after teleporting from Ruberios to Ingracia through the</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Teleportation Gate</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. Since there is no replacement for her horse, she had to stop to rest frequently.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She packed only the bare minimum in terms of luggage as she is used to military marching.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She only brought her horse, and a sleeping bag that also contains convenient tools such as emergency rations or pots.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is winter at this time of year.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although the snow isn&rsquo;t heavy enough to block the road, it is still not a good time to travel.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Soon after Hinata set off for the journey, and ran into four of her subordinates. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She heard the sound of running horses behind her and turned to see some familiar faces.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They are the four captains, Arno, Bacchus, Ritase and Fritz.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Vice-commander Reynald needs to stand on guard while Hinata is out.

Hinata eventually gave up and said </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Whatever you wish then</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to allow them to accompany her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now Hinata&rsquo;s party has increased to five people.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Though the roads are somewhat well maintained, they are still rugged, as such, their journey continues slowly..</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In this time of the year, most inns are fully booked, so there isn&rsquo;t any place for them to rest. As a result, they are forced to camp out in the wilderness. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although they didn&rsquo;t run into any monsters, the piercing cold of winter coupled with sad meals consisting solely of emergency rations made this journey a taxing one on both the mind and the body. By the tenth day of their journey, they finally reached the Kingdom of Brumund, far more exhausted then they had expected to be.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At this point, Hinata&rsquo;s party decided that they had to seek out an inn for some desperately needed rest and recuperation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">By the way, this town seems has really grown hasn&rsquo;t it?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They each reserved a room for themselves before they met up in the restaurant.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Arno broke the silence immediately saying so.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata agrees as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ritase did report about this, yet it has become obvious how drastic the difference is when seen with your own eyes.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As they were getting dressed and settling down in the inn, they started to observe the demeanor of the streets. The whole market is full of energy despite it being winter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are even items unfamiliar to them on the market. The rural atmosphere Brumund gave off in their past missions have long disappeared.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Have you all seen this? There are even more varieties of clothes. They look like brands I&rsquo;ve only seen in the Ingracia Kingdom, there are even some passer-bys wearing those luxurious clothes!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Speaking of that, it&rsquo;s the same case for weaponeries. All of the gear here seem to be crafted with monster materials, making them of very fine quality.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Arno and Bacchus both found such sights to be astounding.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Indeed, although these gears are not comparable with the ones used by the Holy Knights, the commodities of this town have exceeded both the quantity and quality of those in other small nations. There are also plenty of trading posts around.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Normally they would shut down during the winter days, making the scene here particularly strange.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They are operating &nbsp;because there are customers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words, there are still many merchants and adventurers passing through this rural town despite the winter days.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It must have been the effect of the Tempest Federation&hellip;&hellip;..?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Fritz asks while observing Hinata&rsquo;s expression.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It must have been because this kingdom is trading with the Tempest Federation that such a town was able to develop. He couldn&rsquo;t think of another reason besides that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But it would mean that their actions are completely ignoring the doctrines of Ruminasism.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">They took a gamble to trade with a Demon Lord in pursuit of development&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ritase also mumbles with confusion in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But to be honest, Hinata also agrees with her view.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Normally it would be impossible.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">But he</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is different.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If it was Rimuru, her fellow countryman, he might have made such things a reality.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The evidence is&mdash;&mdash;the menu hanging on the restaurant wall.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Can I take your order?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As soon as the waitress of the inn asked, Hinata replies without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I want ramen.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">So you would like to order ramen! It has been really popular lately.

Yet they began to worry about whether the cuisines are terrible or not. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And soon the dishes are served.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata felt a sense of nostalgia, while for the rest, it is their first time seeing authentic ramen.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hinata pulls her hair up to prevent it from falling into the broth and splits up the disposable chopsticks</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt61" id="ftnt_ref61">[61]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">They are even using disposable chopsticks.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What level of extravagance are they up to&mdash;&mdash;Hinata thought to herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How did they manage to promote disposable chopsticks to the restaurants of a neighbouring country in such a short time? Hinata couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder. Yet the bowl of warm ramen is right in front of her.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Thanks for the meal.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She puts her palms together while whispering. Then she slowly lifts some hot broth up using the soup spoon and drinks it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s the thick pork bone broth. She has no idea how it was cooked to recreate the thickness of the taste. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is then that the noodle she intended to put in her mouth touched her lips, making Hinata gasp with a sound of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Tsk</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Arno and the rest immediately react after seeing this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is it poisoned?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Are you okay, Hinata-sama?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They all rise up to express their care.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hush. Shut up and eat your food.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She scolded her subordinates before putting the noodle on the soup spoon and slowly blowing her breath on it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata doesn&rsquo;t want to scald her tongue. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Such action is somewhat cute considering how it contrasts her cruel appearance. Although she herself didn&rsquo;t notice since she&rsquo;s been focused on tasting the noodle.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The noodle is both tasty and chewy. The delicacy of the thick pork-bone broth has all been imbued onto the noodle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is a most exquisite and delicious cuisine. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A sensation that Hinata thought she would never experience again is beautifully recreated.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She falls silent and only concentrates on eating her ramen.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Arno and the rest, rather terrified, observes Hinata dining. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then they begin to try out ramen by imitating her.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;that&rsquo;s hot!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s delicious! What is this really?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The broth tastes great too!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh, is this some trickery?! How could food like this exist&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The four clumsily used the chopsticks to start to challenge this food named ramen fearfully, yet have given unexpected reactions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">To them, whose main diets mainly consisted of stale bread, salted soups or raw vegetable salads, this unknown dish called ramen has brought them an astronomical amount of shock.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The most appropriate words to describe this sensation would be&mdash;&mdash;Taste revolution.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then again feeling confused, they turn to the rice Hinata ordered. It also accompanies ramen quite well. The more you chew on it, the better it tastes, slowly filling them up. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are also dumplings.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As soon as they take a bite out of the dumplings the fragrance of the ingredients immediately assail their nostrils.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The rich variety of ingredients in the dumpling transforms eating into a concert of taste, which forms a perfect duet with the rice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Amazing! This is so tasty!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Arno praises.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is no wonder the food tastes so good considering the party has been eating field rations until yesterday.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Eventually, there is only one more dumpling remaining on the plate.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Piya! A crisp sound goes off.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Fritz was casually reaching out his chopsticks before they were blocked by the ones in Hinata&rsquo;s hands.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Fritz.

This is actually a secret, but, this dish was created to satisfy the cravings of the Demon Lord-sama. Myourmiles-sama, who owns this establishment, has personal contact with that Demon Lord-sama and has secured exclusive trading for this.. So far, it hasn&rsquo;t sold well because it is both difficult to eat and expensive&hellip;&hellip;. But it&rsquo;s becoming famous for making anyone who eats it even once &nbsp;addicted to it!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The waitress informs them on the supposed secret. Yet given how loud she spoke, everyone in the restaurant would have heard the conversation.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata suddenly realizes that this whole conversation was probably planned from the start in order to promote this dish.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">By doing so, the number of recurring customers will increase along with the total number of customers. In this way, they can mass-produce dumplings to make it a lasting item on the menu.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now everyone in the restaurant is looking rather intrigued at Hinata&rsquo;s party. They are all observing the food Hinata is eating just like how Arno and the rest initially reacted. Perhaps they are planning to order those food items for themselves next time.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hearing the waitress&rsquo; words, Hinata finishes drinking up the soup.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Thank you for the service. It was delicious.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She then pays the tab and rises up from her seat.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She does so while seeing her subordinates downing the soup in a panic.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oh, don&rsquo;t get all flustered. I&rsquo;m only going back to my room. And by the way, you will get fat if you drink all of the soup as well.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Someone suddenly pauses upon hearing that. It&rsquo;s Ritase.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ehh, but&hellip;&hellip; Hinata-sama also&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">My body&rsquo;s disposition is just so that I don&rsquo;t get fat easily.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You have my warning&mdash;&mdash;Hinata leaves after saying that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ritase glares </span><span class="c1">at her back with an angry looks</span><span class="c0">, but Hinata, who wishes to sleep now after a full meal doesn&rsquo;t even want to look back.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The next morning, the party embarks on their journey once again.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They are all in excellent condition after getting sufficient rest.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now that they&rsquo;ve restored their energy, the harsh roads leading to the Jura Great Forest would not pose an issue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s go.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At Hinata&rsquo;s order, everyone resumes their journey. Yet their spirit (to confront hardship) soon disappeared.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What on earth is this.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">This is so comfortable to the point of becoming stale.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s not true, the point is this road! It is paved so beautifully that it can rival the roads in the capital of Ingracia! No matter how you look at it, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense!!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is no wonder why they are so surprised.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The roads have been covered with stone pavements, there aren&rsquo;t even any puddles. The road is designed with a slight curvature where drainage side ditches are installed below.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The journey has been very pleasant since the road is not blocked by snow.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Speaking of which, there isn&rsquo;t any monster aura at all. Though we&rsquo;re in a forest, there&#39;s few signs of monsters at all&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Said Ritase recalling the investigation of the area she did and her findings.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Just as she mentioned, the barrier around these roads are indeed a wonder to behold.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is magic device installed every ten kilometers or so which is used to connect a magic barrier that prevents nearby monster from intruding.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The safety of travelling has thus been elevated, leading more merchants to travel in and out. The reason for the prosperity of Brumund Kingdom must have been due to the gathering of all these merchants.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I wonder, given how much work does it take to pave all these roads, and what would the monster kingdom look like.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No one can give an answer to Arno&rsquo;s question.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone held a similar view to his, all eager to find out the answer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I had heard from merchants that one could even go there on horse. To think it was true...</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed. I thought horses would only be a nuisance when going into &nbsp;the forest It turns out to be an unnecessary concern.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata couldn&rsquo;t help but feel astounded after seeing it for herself even though she was already informed of the mega projects commissioned by Demon Lord Rimuru. After all, the Jura Great Forest that has once been hard to access for outsiders has now become such a convenient travel destination; as if it was just a simple hike. There is no wonder that she feels astonished.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The party continues their journey by horse. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Soon they spotted some hobgoblins riding wolves approaching in front of them.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Have we been revealed!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hold on, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Seeing that her subordinates being alarmed, Hinata calmly corrects them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It turns out she is right.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These hobgoblins seem to be chatting very casually. You can even hear laughter coming from them. They also seem to have spotted Hinata&rsquo;s party due to a good field of view. The hobgoblins raise one of their hands and approached in a friendly manner. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Howdy, I&rsquo;ve never seen you before. You don&rsquo;t look like merchants, are you all adventurers?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I see, I see, in that case, good luck on your job. By the way, I&rsquo;m sure you guys will be fine on your own, but you should keep some things in mind.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This hobgoblin switches his tone as he continued.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He then starts by explaining the rules of the road. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Littering is not allowed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Brawling on the road is not permitted. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you need to set up camp, there are watering holes available for use every ten kilometers apart. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are also outposts (D: The term used here is more like police station, but outpost is fine as well) every twenty kilometers apart, it will be safer to camp there. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you have the budget, there are inns every forty kilometers apart. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you see anyone in trouble, you need to contact the nearest outpost.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">etc, etc.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">By the way, please do not touch the glowing stone tablets set every ten kilometers. The punishment for damaging those things is severe.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Those glowing tablets are magic devices used to maintain the barrier. They glitter when mixed alongside the stone-paved road and can act as waypoint at night.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">Are you really monsters?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The level of detail in the briefing would truly make that hard to believe.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Alright, we understand. Thank you for your caring inform.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t mention it. People like us are patrolling the area precisely to help anyone in trouble.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These Hobgoblins are the members of the security force in charge of patrolling. They promptly left after saying those words.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata&rsquo;s party stayed on the spot to see them off with bewildered looks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh, Hinata-sama&hellip;....</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Wait, settle down. I need to think for a bit, so could you please stop talking for awhile?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata silenced the rest and started pondering.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Afterward, having quietly traveled onwards for an hour, a watering hole came into view. It was exactly where the hobgoblin said it would be, down to the kilometer marker..</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In order to showcase the current location, there are sign posts set every kilometer to display the travelling distance starting from zero at the west gate to the capital city Rimuru. It becomes very clear how many more kilometers you would need to travel in order to reach a water source, outpost or inn. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata knows she can ensure the party&rsquo;s safety by relying on these signs after seeing how the road (Highway) is constructed. She can immediately tell from the signs where to retreat when she needs to back up. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It just goes to show that Rimuru genuinely cares for the travelers&rsquo; and has already done much in ensuring their personal safety.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">By the way, the units of measurement in this world is different from his original world. Yet Rimuru has ignored that in order to mark the road in ways easily understood by himself. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Kilometer is set by pegging the average travel distance with the estimate of an hour&rsquo;s walking to cover five kilometers. Thus the reason why the inns are prepared one every forty kilometers due to the assumption that travelers can move eight hours a day on foot. Since horse carriages move at around the same speed as those on on foot, they would also be able to rest at inns if they slow down a little. The whole trip was thoroughly planned out and thought through with very clear intent.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It has become quite the obvious fact that Rimuru hopes to coexist with humans. There really isn&rsquo;t anything left to doubt. The journey since departing the Brumund Kingdom has all been very comfortable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The drinking area contains a directly drinkable water source that seems to be free for the public&rsquo;s consumption.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata almost fainted after seeing this. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Free water&mdash;&mdash;Applying such Japanese ideal in a dangerous place like this, it is a bold and crazy enough move that even Hinata wants to make fun of (roast).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are also cooking spots for campers and even squares for the convenience of setting up tents. Some locations have sets of long benches made of log wood with roofs to provide cover during rainfall.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All of these resemble a campsite.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The divine realm of Jura Great Forest once inaccessible to humans, is now a harmonious venue easily accessible to everyone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are many different monsters residing in the Jura Great Forest. It is a dangerous place where adventurers below Rank B may easily lose their lives if they are not careful. It is not supposed to be a place for human residence, but a paradise for the monsters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">I can&rsquo;t believe he has developed this forbidden land so it&rsquo;s accessible by everyone</span><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;.Hinata didn&rsquo;t even once consider the idea. It is not a matter of whether she can achieve it or not, but something which is beyond her imagination.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Not only for her, but it must have been the same for her fellow countryman Yuuki Kagurazaka.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When they are striving hard to protect mankind by distancing them from the threat of monsters, yet someone just suddenly comes along and&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c1 c14">What kind of joke is this</span><span class="c0">. It&rsquo;s normal for Hinata to think this way.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">&mdash;&mdash;But, at least now I understand what he meant by his words.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata&rsquo;s thoughts wander to the past.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was at a cafe in Ingracia that Hinata likes a lot. There she was doing the regular intelligence exchange with Yuuki. It was then that she heard the rumors about Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rimuru seemed to be serious about developing the monster kingdom. Not only that, he wished to find the best way to create friendly relations with the Western Nations. An example of his method is the recently introduced Brandy Cake. This dessert is only made possible thanks to the alcohol that Rimuru made easily commissionable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Anyhow, that person is really different. Should I call him having his cards hidden or not. He seems to have a much grander vision in the long term than us. That&rsquo;s why including acts such as making delicacy like this, he has been doing all of them very seriously.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yuuki said to her with a wry smile as Hinata was enjoying the delightful taste of the cake slowly eating it bit by bit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He then advised her that making an enemy of Rimuru would not be a wise move. It was implying that the Freedom Association would be on Rimuru&rsquo;s side. Back then Hinata didn&rsquo;t take his words seriously nor did she imply it, but up to this point&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">&mdash;&mdash;Indeed, if he doesn&rsquo;t have energy to spare in spades, there is no way he could have had the energy to plan such things.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata thought to herself as she observes the merchants using the water source with thanksgiving.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Two hours passed after they left the drinking area.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They encountered their first inn. It is said that there are seven inns in total on this road, this one being the seventh.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata and the rest decided to rest there for the night.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The party gathered at the restaurant.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Alright, everyone. Let&rsquo;s hear what you all think.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata begins her inquiry.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Arno spoke up first while also representing everyone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I want to give my genuine opinion here, is it okay?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s the type of view I&rsquo;m looking for. Speak then.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hurried by Arno answers:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Just from seeing these roads alone, I think that Demon Lord Rimuru is a wise ruler. These roads guarded on patrols makes this path feel safe so it&rsquo;s no wonder why so many have gathered here. The trade routes through the Farmus Kingdom will no doubt start to fall out of favor (when competing with these).</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Next is Bacchus, he answers solemnly:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hmm, the monsters are not the only things to be afraid of. There are also bandits who would attack caravans, incidents when people get injured or sick or when the carriage breaks down to immobilized travellers etcetera. Such issues would never cease to occur. But with more people flowing in, there would probably be less concern for such things.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The fact alone that you are in an environment where you can expect help during these hardship is already very reassuring.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s the same logic when it comes to monetary expenses, there is no longer a need to hire a large mercenary band. That&rsquo;s all&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As Bacchus finishes, Ritase and Fritz both nods in agreement.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Most of these have been complements of Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">He spent more time managing the country than most trashy vassal lords. Rather than Demon Lord, it&rsquo;d be more suitable to call him a wise king.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed, there&rsquo;s a lot that can be learnt from him. Our nation of Ruberios should also make use of these designs.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Thank goodness that we have yet to label him as the </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Nemesis of God</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Next, we can only hope that Demon Lord Rimuru is willing to accept Hinata-sama&rsquo;s apology&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata nods to them, showing her agreement.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I can only try to apologize with sincerity. But if my apology alone is not sufficient and that Demon Lord Rimuru still wishes to duel me, I will have no choice but to accept&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, Hinata is still rather confused.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why would Rimuru wish to duel her at this point in time? Even if he cannot forgive her for what she has done, there is no need to start a fight solely on that basis.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Perhaps he hoped to demonstrate to her his power after awakening as a Demon Lord&mdash;&mdash;Or something along those lines. But Hinata doesn&rsquo;t think Rimuru is someone with such vulgar thoughts.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With scepticism in their hearts, Hinata&rsquo;s party continues to journey on without much challenge.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They found residence in another inn on the seventh night of their journey again. The level of luxury there has come to rival the top-grade inns in the Ingracia Kingdom. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is even a bathhouse to wash away the tiredness of travelling. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet the inn&rsquo;s staff always contains a number of Brumund citizens.

Why are our attacks useless against them!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But they are not undead, what is going on?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Holy Knights exclaim.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In place of a verbal response, the members of Yomigaeri scratch the Holy Knight with the small knives in their hands.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They used their body as bait to sneak in their attack on the stronger Holy Knights. It is an impressive move, possible only by using their undead characters.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But, that is probably as far as they can go. What follows should be the overwhelming one-sided victory of the Holy Knights who will finally get serious&hellip;&hellip; yet my prediction has been completely toppled.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Holy Knights are beginning to fall apart in less than three minutes. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As I have predicted, the Holy Knights who are no longer careless began to chase down members of Yomigaeri one-sidedly. Yet situation is quickly changed. Due to the difference of their strength, I thought that they couldn&rsquo;t possibly win through being unkillable. That&rsquo;s why I designed the plan for them to hold back the enemies. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But as it turns out, the Yomigaeri completely recover from even severe injuries while the Holy Knights begin to fall to the ground one by one.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The fallen Holy Knights are quickly restrained of their actions by </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Kurenai</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ehehe, Holy Knight-san. My knife here is applied with strong hypnotic, a lot of them! Even a single scratch would guarantee our victory!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The eyes of the petit child-like soldier meet with those of the Holy Knight as she explains to him. Shouldn&rsquo;t you refrain from explaining this type of things to the enemies? But it can&rsquo;t be helped since she&rsquo;s still a child.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Announcement. Individual </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Gobye</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is older than individual </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Gobta</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">. </span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Are you kidding me!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I see, the biology of monsters is truly difficult to understand. Gobta didn&rsquo;t have much change in his appearance despite his evolution. Perhaps he will turn out to have some drastic changes in the future.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Regardless, let&rsquo;s put that aside first.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Right now the hilarious sight of a little girl lecturing a Holy Knight is unfolding before my eyes. It would seem the Yomigaeri are in fact, not struggling in battle, but mastering it. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Unless the knights were cautious enough to have prepared antidotes or possess </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Poison Resistance</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, they will always be defeated by such assault. Even though it may only be used once, it&rsquo;s still a very effective method.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, we can&rsquo;t just stop here.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The other knights arriving wouldn&rsquo;t dare to be careless and charge in with their full force. Such trickery will no longer be easily pulled when confronted with such an overwhelming difference in strength. It has already become useless after being witnessed by others.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Our soldiers only managed to land a scratch when they struck while their opponents were tricked into believing that they&rsquo;ve struck a fatal blow. However, I would give them the highest commemoration for having retired half of the enemies with just a scratch. They truly did a great job.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Next according to the plan, we are supposed to engage in a protracted battle&mdash;&mdash; Yet my idea is completely turned around again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion suddenly points with her chin.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In front of her are Gobjay and Gobua; The two look confused and turn their eyes to Shion.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Are we supposed to join as well?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh! Are you not going? We few alone would not be enough to beat all those strong looking guys&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No, that&rsquo;s why, we don&rsquo;t have to win the fight, all we need to do is to win some time&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh eh? But I remember the order she received was to win no matter what?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gobua knew the content of the meeting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even though she was only guarding the gate, the voices of our meeting must have crossed through. Gobjay seems to be hearing about this for the first time as he looks at Gobua with his eyes wide open in shock&mdash;&mdash;Are the two at cross purposes?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh, aren&rsquo;t we told to be on hold after the meeting&hellip;&hellip;.?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Perhaps fearing that Gobjay would go on and on about the meeting, Gobua asks Shion. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s true. I thought it was strange too, but thankfully I didn&rsquo;t seem to be wrong.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet Shion suddenly raised her volume to scold: </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Are you two idiots? Can&rsquo;t you see that victory is close at hand? You can only exceed your limits by challenging and triumphing against the strong. You should be grateful for this opportunity I&rsquo;ve granted you.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s a weird expression from Shion&hellip;&hellip;. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The victory is close at hand despite the fact that the enemies are stronger than us. That sounds quite contradictory. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet Gobua is moved by her words. Her eyes switch to a different light with a maniacal smile across her face.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You are most correct, this is indeed the case. Such great opportunity shall be taken by us </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Kurenai</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And so she quickly accepts Shion&rsquo;s proposal.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gobjay on the other hand&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">A-about that&hellip;&hellip;. Aren&rsquo;t we defying orders that way?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He asks Shion while shivering.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Why are you still here? Or perhaps, do you wish to choose your prefered path between doing as I said and becoming my new test subject (to eat my food)? </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How awful, poor Gobjay is forced to comply under Shion&rsquo;s intimidation. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But it is not up to him at this point, and so Gobjay rushes panicky into battle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&hellip;&hellip;.No, you did nothing wrong.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But, how strange. For some reason, it almost seems as though the fault is on Gobjay.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gobua is very aggressive in battle and easily instigated as expected from being Benimaru&rsquo;s subordinate. While Gobjay may look dumb, he always does his job very seriously. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He should just keep the things he wishes to ask to himself. Spilling them out will always land him in hot water. But he hasn&rsquo;t discovered that he has brought this upon himself. I suppose that&rsquo;s a form of joy in itself, so I don&rsquo;t intend to interrupt.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">....... Is this okay, Benimaru?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not really okay, but I&rsquo;ll consider it training in dealing with unexpected things. Especially since Shion has a keen instinct. She would only give such an order when she knows there is a chance to win.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I couldn&rsquo;t help but ask while Benimaru answers me with a shrug.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Indeed.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is out of fear of losing that I ordered them to buy time as much as possible. But there wouldn&rsquo;t be any need to hold back if they can paralyze the enemies without getting hurt at all.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since I&rsquo;m now on the same page with them, I focus myself on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Next comes an authentic exchange of offense and defense.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Yomigaeri members pair up to confront the remaining fifty Holy Knights directly with a member of Kurenai supporting each pair. If they are to fight with all they have, the Kurenai would be defeated by the Holy Knights. But, the difference in their strength is not so desperately different.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">While the Holy Knights may have achieved Rank A, they are only at baseline for the Rank. In contrast, the strengths of Kurenai are approaching Rank A. They can probably make it with some assistance.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover, the members of Kurenai are taking turns. The members who are taking care of the injured are exchanging shifts with the tired members. And since we have healing potions, this cycle of switching would continue infinitely.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">By the way, their combat abilities are really impressive. I didn&rsquo;t expect such individuals to exist in this country.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">These words came from Alvis.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She is commenting not on the Kurenai, but the Yomigaeri.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They all possess powerful undead bodies on top of having good combat endurance. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed, they are hard to deal with. It seems decapitation alone won&rsquo;t be able to stop them, that would make them hard to take on even for me.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Suphia shares the same sentiment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They both seem to think the Yomigaeri are difficult to deal with.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even I was surprised.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Holy Knights are not taking turns in fighting. Our victory is not a dream if things continue like this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s just that it isn&rsquo;t according to the original plan&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I tacitly agree. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And looking at Shion&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She is observing the battlefield with a satisfied look while licking her lips with her tongue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The watery tip of her pink tongue exposed momentarily gives off a seductive luster.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion turns around to look at our location. She seems to have spotted us as she gives off a smiley face. She was just looking at Gobjay with a devilish expression, which is far fetched for anyone to imagine she could put up a smile on her face right now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Rimuru-sama, everything is going according to plan!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No way! We never planned these stunts in our meeting!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Thanks for your praise!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I wasn&rsquo;t praising you&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Then, it&rsquo;s about time for me to go!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion finishes her sentence before thrusting her feet against the ground to launch herself out like a bullet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eh, where are you going&hellip;&hellip;.?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She ran off without answering my question&hellip;&hellip;..</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She is sprinting at full speed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata is sprinting at full speed across the narrow lanes of the forest, with her perception enhanced by the spiritual force hosted within her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At an empty space with few vegetation, she spots five Greater Majins. They seem to know that Hinata is approaching, yet they are fixing their eyes afar. Hinata also turns herself to the direction of their eyes. The things Hinata sees are the sights of her proud knights being beaten to a pulp.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She really wants to smack her mouth out loud, but Hinata endures. She is not angry at the fact that they are being defeated, but that her opponents have chosen to completely antagonize her men. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since the battle has already started, there is no more chance for negotiation. It would be irrelevant to Rimuru now even if Hinata tells him that they have reason for doing so.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rimuru isn&rsquo;t averting his eyes from the battlefield. And Hinata naturally remains stationary at her location as well. She is analyzing the strength of her opponents while planning ahead.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are in total four powerful Greater Majins. In addition, a woman in suit that is giving off a abnormal aura.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The two women at the front seem to be Beastmen. The relationship between Demon Lord Rimuru and ex-Demon Lord Karion was mentioned in the report before. Deducing from this, the two should be from the famous Order of Beast King&rsquo;s Warrior, the Three Beastketeer. They give off a style of the strong and power that average Majins could only dream to reach.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, the two persons standing next to them are not by any chance inferior than the Beastketeers. Moreover&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One of them is a handsome red-haired man with a pair of dark horns. The other majin stood in contrast to him is a blue-haired youth with a single white horn grown on his forehead.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The Three Beastketeers! And Orges&mdash;&mdash;No, are those Kijins?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Arno caught up to Hinata and lowered his volume to ask her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata continues quietly observing the Majins without giving a response.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;No. They are Youki (Fair Oni).</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Are you saying they are Youki?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve heard of them. Those are monsters possessing mighty strength to rival that of the Earth Deity. Some heretics seem to even worship Youki as god&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">In fact, they seem to be an evolved version of Kijin. It&rsquo;s rumored that only few were able to reach that realm. But, they are right here before our eyes. We should assess their threat as Special Rank A.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is the domain of Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata and her men are unwelcome guests Arno is and the rest are well aware of that as well, and they are all experiencing nerve-wrecking stress.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Back to Hinata.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Threat level of Special Rank A&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c15 c1 c14">We may in fact be underestimating their strength by that ranking.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Especially that red-haired Majin, he seems to possess strength to surpass </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Demon Lord Breed</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. It&rsquo;s best to send out three captains including Arno in order to stand against him. Yet right now there are four Majins in total with only four captains on her side. It couldn&rsquo;t have been a coincidence, and so she interprets this as Rimuru having intentionally paired up the fighters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And last but not the least&mdash;&mdash;Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The overwhelming presence of him is nothing like the feeling he gave to her in the past.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I shall be your opponent. Come and duel me.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata recalls the line.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Yes, that is the case. You hope to duel me alone and not be intervened, was that what you meant?</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then she will take this as the worst possible scenario and hope that her own life can be sacrificed for Demon Lord Rimuru to spare her subordinates.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">No, that&rsquo;s not right.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She is going to triumph, and then ask Rimuru to accept her apology.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata makes up her mind.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At this moment, the female Majin in a suit begins to move out.

Both of us are observing the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Our eyes soon meet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We stood there staring at each other with silence for a while.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then I speak up first:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You&rsquo;ve really done it now, Hinata. It goes without saying that this is my territory. It is obvious that you all bear ill intent towards us.

Once they open the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Holy Purification Barrier</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, we will definitely be defeated, that&rsquo;s why Shion had to take the pre-emptively attack.

It seems that the strongest knight is fighting against Shion at the moment. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is another one there.

Shion is displaying her fighting prowess having them both as her opponent.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t stand it, but since the situation has developed to this point, I can only leave them to find out who&rsquo;s stronger. It makes me somewhat upset to admit that Hinata is right, but now the demand I gave seems pretty hard to achieve.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then, a young knight suddenly interrupts:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What nonsense! If we were to withdraw our forces in this situation, what would happen to Hinata-sama? </span><span class="c1 c14">You</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;are the one who called Hinata here, who&rsquo;s to guarantee that you won&rsquo;t harm her!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He shouts angrily after hearing my words.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The way you put it sounds to me like that you never intended to negotiate peace with us from the very beginning&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Shut your mouth.

Instead, he was a genius in the art of arcane magic&mdash;&mdash;A Holy Magister.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The Holy Magister is a special job assigned only to individuals who have mastered </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Spirit Magic</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Elemental Magic</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Holy Magic</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.To master the laws of this world, that is what qualifies a Holy Magister.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet Reynald became a swordsman who fought in battlefields wielding the holy sword. He has concealed his identity as a Holy Magister while at the same time, his reputation as a member of the Holy Knight Order grew day by day. Later, after some time, he had already become the vice-commander of the Holy Knight Order.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">All these accomplishments were the result of his skills. He has mastered a magnificent set of sword skills. If you were to describe Arno&rsquo;s skill as the sword of steel, then Reynald would be representing the swiftness</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt64" id="ftnt_ref64">[64]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;of swordsmanship. The two are on par with each other in terms of strength with Arno slightly excelling with the sword. It is Arno&rsquo;s hard-earned skill from his countless struggles on the battlefield. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When confronting strong and enduring monsters, a swordsmanship of tenacity and strength is more important than one that is fancy. That&rsquo;s why Arno is worthy of the title of the strongest Holy Knight.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, a swordceror</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt65" id="ftnt_ref65">[65]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;who possesses both the skills of a mage and a swordsman&mdash;&mdash;that is the way Reynald fights. His swordsmanship may be inferior to Arno, yet he will not lose to anyone when fighting in the style of a proper swordceror. No, not only not falling behind to anyone, Reynald would even claim that his power is far greater than anyone else&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, to the Holy Knights, the power of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Elemental Magic</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is not within the assessment of their strength. Some Holy Knights can instill elemental magic with the elven spirit of the same element that reside inside them so they may cast powerful magic without time consumed in chanting the spells.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Elemental Magic</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;requires chanting, so its casting speed is longer &nbsp;than </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Spirit Magic</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">. Although its power may be greater than </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Spirit Magic</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Speed</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is the essence of melee combat.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is something even Reynald would not be able to overcome, and so he needed to master his sword techniques.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A knight&rsquo;s true strength stems from his mastery of sword art. By instilling the sword travelling and incredible speed</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt66" id="ftnt_ref66">[66]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;with holy-element, you can generate the power to slash through any object in this world. That is what Reynald believes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A very vivid memory was left with him when Reynald was still an apprentice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The small nation he studied abroad at was trampled by Demon Lord Valentine. Someone rushed to that nation&mdash;&mdash;Hinata who just became a Holy Knight at the time.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She was strong, truly strong.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When surrounded by a horde of monsters, it only took a swing of her thin sword to wipe them all out. Even monsters that were several times larger than an average human were decimated in one shot by her sword.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata&rsquo;s visit saved the locals who had fallen to despair. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">From that day onward, Reynald was attracted by the charm of swordsmanship.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">While researching Spirit Magic on one hand, he could not forget the sights of Hinata&rsquo;s sword, and so he practiced repeatedly using a wooden sword while imitating her. He soon mastered the art of arcane magic</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt67" id="ftnt_ref67">[67]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and returned to his academy in Ingracia Kingdom. There he studied Elemental Magic and waited patiently for the chance of moving to the Holy Empire Ruberios.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was not easy for foreigners to immigrate to Holy Empire Ruberios, but if it was a believer of Ruminas with outstanding achievement, he may be granted permission. However, it would come at the price of severing ties with his family. Reynald chose to migrate without any hesitation. His mastery of both Elemental and Spirit Magic got him the permission to immigrate.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Later he studied Holy Magic in Ruberios and was able to earn a place as an apprentice Knight in the Order. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There Reynald formed a pact with the spirit of</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Light</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He was the Holy Knight of light, just as reflected from his pure and noble soul.

It is even higher than a Rank A monster. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It isn&rsquo;t Demon Lord Rimuru, but it must be his top lieutenant.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This would be the skirmish battle before taking on Demon Lord Rimuru. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They must quickly defeat this Majin in order to eliminate the primary target&mdash;&mdash;Reynald has made up his mind to not hold back at all and to fight with everything he has from the very start.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Take aim of the target and activate the Holy Purification Barrier!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They will lose their lives if they demonstrate even the slightest bit of carelessness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He doesn&rsquo;t think that it is necessary to test out their opponent&rsquo;s strength and directly issued the order. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Holy Knights spread around quickly to establish the Holy Barrier. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was casted perfectly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is no way that this enemy would be able to break through the barrier from within. However, this is still not enough. After all, a simplified version of the barrier also only has a simplified endurance. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It has less range and weaker effects on weakening the monster. It may be able to block the enemy&rsquo;s movement, yet whether it can block every attack from within is still a mystery. They are afraid that the enemy would cast a powerful magic using its remaining magicule from inside the pyramid-shaped barrier extending around five meters long that they&rsquo;ve activated. If that is the case, the barrier is likely going to be shattered.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover, such an attack may also affect the surrounding. Since normally a barrier would cover a much larger area, this is a situation that should be accounted for with caution. However, it is definitely capable of severing the passage of magicules. It is one of the trump cards of the Holy Knights that an average Greater Majin would have no chance of breaking.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reynald couldn&rsquo;t dare to get careless as he orders everyone to activate another defensive barrier. If the purification barrier is unable to kill their foe, they will have come up with a viable defensive plan during their available time. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They still can attack the interior from outside the barrier, but first they will need to confirm their safety before doing so. If it is a rare monster that possesses an attribute of damage-reflection, attacking without caution would only cause larger casualties among themselves. It is a misstep he cannot afford to take.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As Reynald&rsquo;s party prepares at hand, the dust caused by the explosion also begin to settle. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A monster appears at the center.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is a purple-haired tall female with slim and fit body. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her long tied hair runs behind her back. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She has a beautiful face with a mighty stern. But she has an additional black horn on her forehead. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The strange and exotic clothing (suit) compels one to take a few more glances before coming to any conclusion.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The woman speaks up as her purple eyes gaze at Reynald.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">My name is Shion. I am Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s No.1 secretary. Now listen up you humans, Rimuru-sama has spoken. You either </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Surrender</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c2">&#12302;</span><span class="c1">Die</span><span class="c2">&#12303;</span><span class="c1">, pick an option.

So do quickly, disarm yourself and surrender to us!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How arrogant this monster called Shion is as she proclaimed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is unknown why she emphasized very proudly on the word </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No.1</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as she gave her speech casually. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reynald begins to observe his opponent in order to find out how strong this monster called Shion really is. She is clearly different from an average monster. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her large pool of magicule leads Reynald to categorize her at the higher end of Rank A, but it does not end there.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Impressive. She is at Special Rank A, possibly even a candidate for Demon Lord.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Judging from the horn on her forehead, the enemy is a advanced species of the Kijin race.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">Kijin, or even stronger</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;Reynald concludes that Shion&rsquo;s is a </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Youki</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(Fair Oni), a being that is comparable in power to a </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Demon Lord Breed</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A named </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Youki</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;That is definitely beyond Calamity rank. If she becomes a Demon Lord, her threat level would increase to Disaster rank.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There has been an extraordinarily powerful individual that possessed the psychic power (Or Godly Power)</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt68" id="ftnt_ref68">[68]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;to alter heaven and earth. Rather than monster, those are more akin to the Earth Deity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It seems that Reynald has made the right choice to have remained on the highest alert with the rest.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Huh! Unfortunately you&rsquo;ve guessed it wrong. Well, close enough. I am an </span><span class="c1 c14">Akki</span><sup class="c1 c11 c14"><a href="#ftnt69" id="ftnt_ref69">[69]</a></sup><span class="c1">.

Regardless of where she got the idea, it was the warning that Shion gave them.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">An </span><span class="c1 c14">Akki</span><span class="c1">? The&rsquo;re isn&rsquo;t much difference... Anyway whatever you are is irrelevant to us. Even if you were an Earth deity, you are nothing more than an evil monster, as far as we&rsquo;re concerned. We only believe in the one true God, Ruminas.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Holy Empire of Ruberios only recognizes the existence of one god - &ldquo;The One True God&rdquo; Ruminas. To them, this is an absolute truth..</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They wouldn&rsquo;t acknowledge her even if she is indeed an the Earth Deity guarding some part of the land. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They may ignore it as long as it doesn&rsquo;t start proclaiming itself to be a God, but if it did, it will be eliminated.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover, their opponent right now is just a monster. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No matter how powerful she is, they will not spare any mercy for the minions of a Demon Lord. That is why Reynald proclaimed his own beliefs.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet Shion responded with the utterly unacceptable to Reynald.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not interested in your God. Just give an answer to my question already!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Surrender or die, which path do you choose? That&rsquo;s what Shion is asking.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her words infuriated Reynald.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Silence, evil monster! I will erase your filthy existence from this world!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Reynald now furiously shouts with his lungs full, then he orders the Holy Knights to cast the Holy Magic </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Holy Cannon</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at the same time.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Holy Cannon</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is one of the few offensive spells in the art of Holy Magic. It breaks down the body of a monster through disintegrating its magicule. If it is casted at humans, it at most would knock them down unconscious due to the shockwave, yet in the case of monsters, they would be completely decimated. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is a useless skill against opponent with the holy-element, but a deadly deterrence against monsters. Unlike the four natural elements of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Earth</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Water</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Fire</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Wind</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, both </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Holy</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Dark</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;elements cannot be </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Nullified</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. Except the angel race and the monsters who possess the holy-element, any other monster would not stand a chance against the Holy Cannon.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As they received Reynald&rsquo;s order, the Holy Knights launched the attack simultaneously. The missiles from the Holy Cannon thrust from all four sides towards Shion.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Confronted with such attacks, Shion stood still without a care. She then deflected all of the energy missiles with the odachi in her hand.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Was that your answer? You understand that if you don&rsquo;t surrender, I will kill you right?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As if grumbling &ldquo;why won&rsquo;t you guys just do as I say?&rdquo;, Shion presses her question to him again. Even Reynald is astounded at this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, he is not going to succumb to such a threat. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even if his enemy is monster at the level of a Earth Deity, she was already trapped by the Holy Purification Barrier. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reynald&rsquo;s party waited for the enemy to weaken by maintaining the barrier in order to deliver her with a fatal blow. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He ponders while praising the skillful swordsmanship Shion demonstrated. &nbsp; &nbsp; Reasonably speaking, his opponent would have been weakened to some extent, yet the speed of her swing can rival even that of Reynald&rsquo;s. This surprises him a lot. &nbsp;Moreover, that odachi was capable of deflecting energy of the holy-element, which is beyond abnormal. Since the Holy Cannon has the character of disintegrating magicules, normal magic swords would be destroyed after deflecting a few rounds.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet there is no sign of that odachi being damaged.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Suddenly, one of the Holy Knight began to moan in pain. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is the Holy Knight on one side of the pyramid-shaped barrier who has been hit by the Holy Cannon deflected by Shion.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">How is this possible! Why is such thing possible!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reynald is astounded.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If blocking the holy-element alone is not enough, she even absorbed the energy with her odachi and quickly deflected the missile to turn it into a way to attack&hellip;&hellip;..</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is completely impossible by common sense.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet such psychic power was displayed by Shion so easily in the blink of an eye. Reynald quickly orders everyone to stop attacking. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The injured knight did not lose consciousness, he&rsquo;s at most surprised at the sudden attack. Now it&rsquo;s the time to calm down and find out a different way of attacking. Yet still, this has really been astounding. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The fact that she was able to attack from the inside of the Holy Purification Barrier to the outside is beyond surprising. Even the Holy Knights are astounded at the sight.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reynald suppresses his emotion of shock to reconsider his strategy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Right now Shion is furious due to her act being less effective as she intended. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t cause much damage despite hitting the opponent. She discovered that the skill they used was effective against monsters, but ineffective against humans. She has paid the price for looking down on her opponents to have been locked in the barrier, a critical miscalculation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, she knew from the start that things will end up this way. She has considered beforehand that the situation she is currently in is what she had hoped for. This barrier&mdash;&mdash;It&rsquo;s an extension of the Holy Purification Barrier Rimuru warned her of. It is similar in nature to reduce the magicule concentration from within the barrier. At this rate, it wouldn&rsquo;t take long before Shion&rsquo;s skill will be affected. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Just now she secretly tried to find out that </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Dimensional Transportation</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;has also been blocked. With that being said, this is also within her range of expectations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oi&hellip;&hellip; OI, you guys, just surrender already before I run out of patience.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion suppresses her anger desperately and shouts at her opponents with a forced smile.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although a third party may think Shion isn&rsquo;t even batting an eyelid at the Holy Knights, in reality she couldn&rsquo;t be more serious. (it&rsquo;s Shion after all)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But it is obvious that Reynald and the Holy Knights wouldn&rsquo;t listen to her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You fool! You are helpless now that you&rsquo;ve been trapped by the barrier, stop acting all smug over there!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This time, it&rsquo;s Gerald who shouted out furiously.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It only angers Shion more.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now that her fury is reaching her limit, she is at the brink of an outburst. Shion already has very low tolerance for things, and now she is at the limit of her endurance.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There will be a huge outburst sooner or later.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Listen now, I really am under Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s orders that if possible, I shouldn&rsquo;t try to kill you all. If you surrender now, not only will I not beat all your teeth out, but I&rsquo;ll even &nbsp;treat you to my handmade cooking! How about that, isn&rsquo;t it a great proposal? This is my last warning to you. What will you do?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even under such circumstance, Shion endures and continues to negotiate.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although she comes off as being so arrogant, that no one would ever accept such a request.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moreover, with every second passing, the monster captured inside the Holy Purification Barrier will grow weaker.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The reason behind it is simple, the barrier would purify all magicule inside it.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With the magicule concentration reduced, it would mean that any magic casted using mana or monster power, as well as law-manipulating skills such as psychic power and magic manipulation would all become unavailable. That is with the exception of special (unique/ultimate) skills.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The Holy Knights believed that they will emerge victorious and so there is no need to listen to Shion. Yet they have to recognize one point, that the Holy Purification Barrier is no defensive barrier. Even though it may completely block passage of magicule, pure physical objects or energy can still pass through. For instance, if an explosion takes place inside the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Barrier</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, the wind pressure and shreds of explosion would be carried on the outside. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reynald and the rest are all well aware of this, and so their nerves are still tightened. Their maximum alert is of course warranted too. But being on high alert is still not enough to wipe away the unease in his heart, yet still Reynald decides to answer Shion.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">We Holy Knights do not negotiate with monsters. Whatever more you say is futile.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He says so.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer after hearing this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Very well, I understand! Then I will make you submit out of fear!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As Shion shouts, she smashes her odachi on the ground.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The shockwave explodes the ground to send countless fragments of small stones flying in the air. Shion grabs onto one of them and throws it head-on towards the knight facing her.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;Uh!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In an instant.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A loud sound is produced as a mini explosion occurs in front of the Holy Knight that Shion faces. The piece of stone thrown at him collided with the shield over the knight&rsquo;s hand and got shredded to pieces.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">What incredible POWER! </span><span class="c2 c14">&#12468;&#12468;&#12468;&#12468;&#12468;&#12468;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She possesses such power even after being weakened. She must be capable of causing much more damage had the Holy Purification Barrier not been there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t get careless! Infuse more power into your spirit armor!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Understood, everyone, it&rsquo;s time to get serious!

This skill is capable of overwriting objects with the ideal </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Outcome</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;desired by the user&mdash;&mdash;the so called </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Affirmative Outcome</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is the true power of Shion&rsquo;s skill </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Chef</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. The reason why Shion&rsquo;s cooking became tasty is all due to the effect of this skill. Sadly, such extraordinary power has been used in very pitiful things.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What would be the result of applying it in combat?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The answer is the desperate situation that Reynald&rsquo;s party is facing right now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The skill is able to overwrite and impose one hundred percent of the ideal outcome she wishes, and so no matter how strong a defense is, it won&rsquo;t stand a chance against her. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The only way to fight it would be to possess a stronger will to overwrite the result she wishes. In other words, unless you possess similar ability to overwrite laws, you have no way of dealing with it. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since Reynald is a genius, he was able to correctly analyze the mystery of her skill.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">How terrifying.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As Shion just declared, Reynald&rsquo;s heart is now filled with fear. But as captain, he cannot give up hope until the very last moment. They are doomed if they engage in combat, so he needs to surrender for now to have a chance in survival.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">This is bullshit&hellip;&hellip;.How could this be&hellip;&hellip;.. Such monster, how&hellip;...</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ignoring Gerald, who is mumbling and almost daydreaming, Reynald makes the decision.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;I surrender. I hope you may treat my subordinates with leniency&hellip;...</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He proclaims with a shivering voice as if he has woken from a dream.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Shion finally gives off a satisfying smile hearing Reynald&rsquo;s declaration of surrender.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is then that Reynald is able to look at Shion in the eyes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He sees her genuine smile that&rsquo;s both consistent externally and internally.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He calmly recalls while pondering on her words.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This monster called Shion really doesn&rsquo;t seem to intend to kill them. If not Shion&rsquo;s will, then it is the order of Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With that being said, something also seems out of the loop with the rumor that Demon Lord Rimuru has ordered a Demon to murder Archbishop Rayheim.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now that he thinks about it carefully, Hinata only went to meet with Demon Lord Rimuru in order to build a friendly relationship from the very start. In contrast, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any reason why the Demon Lord would want to obstruct that. That is if he doesn&rsquo;t intend to incite conflicts and rain chaos. But from the reaction of this monster, Shion, even Reynald has realized that Demon Lord Rimuru wouldn&rsquo;t do such a thing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That would mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Have I been manipulated&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When he heard that his enemy Demon Lord Valentine who harmed his friends in the past was colluding with Hinata, he lost the ability to make a calm judgement. While he was emotional, he was taken advantage of and was deceived&hellip;&hellip;..</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">By whom?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is obvious now, the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Seven Celestial Sages</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Upon thinking so, Reynald&rsquo;s face immediately turns pale. He is shocked to realize that his dispatchment of troops have hindered Hinata&rsquo;s plan.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As he turns to look, Hinata is confronting Demon Lord Rimuru alone.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They don&rsquo;t seem to be talking. It is the calmness before battle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">I-it&rsquo;s all over. Hinata-sama, I&rsquo;m sorry! It&rsquo;s all my fault that the negotiation&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reynald has finally realized everything, yet now he can only observe their confrontation from the side.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Things have developed to the point beyond Reynald&rsquo;s control.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;And soon, the flame of battle is ignited.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reynald nervously locks his eyes in front as Hinata and Rimuru cross swords&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata Sakaguchi was truly lucky to have met Shizue Izawa.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For a short but genuine period of time, Hinata had indeed opened her heart to Shizue and her alone &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The duration of which was one month. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In that short span of time, Hinata learnt all of Shizue&rsquo;s techniques and bid her farewell. That is because she was afraid of being rejected. In the end, she was afraid to lose the warmth she had regained once more.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata knew she was clumsy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She killed her father for her mother. Yet it only made her mother go insane. Her mother was still in love with her husband even to that point.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The reason why her mother was a fanatic about religion must have been because she needed prayers to support herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In this world, misfortune will never disappear. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is the most natural course of things. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She hoped that there would be no more misfortune in this world, yet such thing would never come true.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That was the reality Hinata didn&rsquo;t want to accept.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A world where everyone can live with joy&mdash;&mdash;she sighs at the misfortune in real life while bearing such dream. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;The reason why her mother prays is to repent for the sins of her daughter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">If that is true, does mother hate me very much?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata was deeply frightened even at the thought of it being the case. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She thought of herself as very lucky for coming to this (new) world. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her mother would be able to escape the sea of pain now that she had travelled to this world, so was her conclusion. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata has also decided to not be as indignant as before. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She would become just as perfect (emotionless/rational) as a machine so that she no longer would have to worry about anything. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata lived on with such a fantasy. And it was for this reason, she wasn&rsquo;t able to accept accept Shizue. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If she had accepted to stay and somehow grew to be disliked by Shizue too&mdash;&mdash;Hinata would have wanted to kill her. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is due to her self-awareness of this, that she parted ways with Shizue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">Perhaps I was the one who&rsquo;s mad after all</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Hinata thought to herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is what this world is about, full of despair and fragile people susceptible to death. Hinata was granted with power for her to survive. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She learnt a shocking lesson when she visited a kingdom during her journey. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There, many were dead due to the rampage of Calamity Rank monsters. Yet there were some people fighting to protect the children. Those adults acted as the meat shield for the children with no intention of escaping. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata had always thought that everyone only care about themselves in order to survive. Their actions moved Hinata. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Those people who devoted themselves to battle called themselves Holy Knights. They had little care for their own lives, and were willing to sacrifice themselves to save the lives of others. They regularly patrolled the surroundings of that town as the symbols of justice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata resonated with their way of living and was determined to become a Holy Knight. To use her skills to the fullest and devote herself to battle, so she will no longer need to worry about anything else. And so, Hinata found her opportunity to atone. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A decade of time have passed since&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata has now become the Guardian Angel of mankind.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She fought against monsters day and night during those days. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After some time, she began to feel bored of dealing with the same situations again and again. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ever since Hinata installed some policies after becoming the commander of the Holy Knight Order, the damage sustained by the nations had been reduced by a drastic amount. For instance, the prediction of the birthplace of the monsters or which areas would be harmed. This way, she was able to decide on how to initiate collaborative efforts and when to patrol in certain areas. This system had been optimized to achieve a significant effect in reducing casualties.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That was why everyone in the Holy Knights placed great trust in Hinata. It is simply too ironic that she was in fact colluding with Demon Lord Valentine behind everyone&rsquo;s back. She mocks herself internally. But even so, it was still the best way to maintain a peaceful and just nation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why Hinata has never felt any doubt or regret. Under their God Ruminas, everything is equal&mdash;&mdash;This is the only system that will grant people the taste of happiness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Moving forward to the present. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She is in a bad spot, to the point of being laughable. But thanks to that, Hinata is finally willing to go all out. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The situation at hand is not suitable for her to negotiate. She will not even have a chance to defend herself if she loses this battle. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It must have been karma for not listening to Rimuru the last time they faced each other, that she fails to request her opponent to listen to her this time for the bad circumstance.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">The situation is the complete opposite of last time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata mocks herself while thinking so.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The table has been turned. It even makes her reminisce of the &ldquo;boring&rdquo; days she used to complain so much about.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">This world is indeed ruthless when you hit the wall&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But apart from lamenting, Hinata has also made up her mind.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Troubling thoughts and worries are all meaningless at this point of time. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Victory is the only way of withdrawing herself from this situation. Regardless of whether she believes herself to be right or wrong.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All these thoughts were cast aside, for Hinata has focused her heart on winning&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She begins to observe Rimuru. Now only Rimuru and herself remain there as Arno and the rest have gone somewhere else with their own opponents. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hinata starts to quietly analyze Rimuru using her Unique Skill </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Mathematician</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, he is completely different from before. Rimuru&rsquo;s power after becoming a Demon Lord has become hard to measure.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14 c15">His potential growth is truly huge. I&rsquo;ll get chills down my spine at even the thought of him becoming enemies with humans.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Rimuru&rsquo;s power is immeasurable by Hinata&rsquo;s </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Mathematician</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, meaning that he should either have a similar power cap as her, or greater. Upon thinking so, Hinata activates her unique skill </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Usurper</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. This skill gives her the absolute advantage against an opponent who is stronger than her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That is the property of Hinata&rsquo;s trump card&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Usurper</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is a power that can rob the enemy of their skills and talents whenever they are understood by the user. Regardless of whether Hinata can use these skills or not, from only its effect of robbing her enemies of their skills alone shows that it is itself a fierce and brutal skill. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If the opponent is weaker than Hinata, the result of the analysis will show it as </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Unavailable Target</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">. In that case, Hinata will not be able to rob the enemy of their skill, however, she will also have a much better chance to win. Even if the opponent is stronger than Hinata, the results of her analysis will either be </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Failure</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Success</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is the evidence whenever such results are shown that whether she is confronting a powerful foe or not. With that being said, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Success</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;analysis will reveal the opponent&rsquo;s skills and talents and </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Failure</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;will not cause her defeat either. She can try analyzing as many times as she wishes. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why no matter how strong her enemy is, the result will always be </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Success</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">with enough repetitions. She only needs to cautiously buy time and calmly wait for the the correct moment. In this way, Hinata is guaranteed to win.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">During her last duel with Rimuru, the result of her analysis stated </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Target Unavailable</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">.</span><span class="c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">This was why Hinata did not take any precaution against Rimuru and looked down on him during their fight. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She was a bit surprised when he summoned the Flame Giant Ifrit, but she still didn&rsquo;t take it very seriously. That&rsquo;s because Hinata has achieved expert mastery of her skill to reach the level of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Forced Usurp</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. It is a cheat-like skill that can even apply to lower-level opponent&hellip;&hellip; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was commendable that Rimuru made her use this skill, but that was as far as her view went for Rimuru. Just like that, Hinata&rsquo;s </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Usurper</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">also serves as the measurement tool to evaluate the difference in power between her and her opponent.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Back to the present day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even with this power, she still cannot assess Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The result of her analysis turned out to be </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Interfered</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is the second time it happened. He is the second person to cause this result after Hinata&rsquo;s confrontation with Demon Lord Ruminas Valentine.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">In other words, you are already as powerful as Ruminas-sama&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata gasps at how much he has grown during such a short period of time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, there is no use to try any cheap tricks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata throws away the giant sword in her hand&mdash;&mdash;Dragon Buster. She knows that she can&rsquo;t win by relying on that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then she unsheathes the Moonlight Rapier (Moonlight) &mdash;&mdash;A legendary weapon of hers gifted by Ruminas.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She puts on the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Gears of Holy Spirit</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">These are the original pieces that the</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Spirit Armament</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;worn by the Holy Knights was copied from. It is rumored to be once worn by a Chosen Hero, and a secret weapon of the Western Saints Church to battle against monsters. It is a gear specialized against monsters and dragons, only usable by those favoured by the Holy Spirit. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A beam of bright light descends to surround Hinata and gradually forms the shape of a glowing armor. From that point onwards, Hinata has broken free of all forms of limits in her body to transcend </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Sage</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and truly reaching the realm of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Saint</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Next, it will be the pure collision of force.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She is willing to gamble everything she has to partake in this challenge. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her ordinary daily life without anything refreshing&mdash;&mdash;has now come to an end. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Fighting a battle with little chance to win is for the foolish. Yet Hinata&rsquo;s heart right now is filled with joy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She gives off a chuckle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Rimuru asked me whether I received his message or not.

She has taken out a more intimidating weapon and her eyes are now absolutely serious.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It can&rsquo;t be helped. I&rsquo;ll defeat her first before trying to talk.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My new confrontation against Hinata has made me realize something.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This woman has no flaw in her stance.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The power of that sword is among the top of all of the weapons I&rsquo;ve encountered so far. In order to stand a chance against it, I also pull out my uchigatana</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt71" id="ftnt_ref71">[71]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;to prepare for battle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Had I known about this, I would have had Kurobee craft me a special blade for this occasion. This sword I am currently wielding has been submerged in the magicules inside my </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Stomach</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, and as a result its blade is now dyed with a fitting color of black. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Still it&rsquo;s now too late to get a new weapon, so rather than panicking, I put my faith in Kurobee&rsquo;s skills (to forge my sword).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Confronting Hinata&rsquo;s weapon with this substitute weapon makes me feel uneasy. I should protect my uchigatana with my Youki (Demonic Aura) and try to avoid direct clashes of swords with her. That&rsquo;s why I activated the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Magic Fighting Spirit</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt72" id="ftnt_ref72">[72]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;from my </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Covenant King Uriel</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and covered the blade with</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Black Thunder Flame</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now that I am properly prepared, I wait for Hinata to make her move.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And so the battle of hyper-speed swordfight begins.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I gave all I had as soon as it started.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hinata&rsquo;s attack speed is incredible, to the point that I can barely react even with</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Thought Acceleration</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, enhancing my senses to a millions of times of my original. Another way to put this would be to say that it is reminiscent of fighting Milim, surely now you can tell how fast it is. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, I am not losing either. I block and return every hit. Now we&rsquo;ve crossed swords directly several times, yet none of us could land a hit on the other. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m not bragging but I haven&rsquo;t even got a scratch.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening, both of us are attacking and are waiting for the opponent to show an opening, yet such an opportunity is still yet to arrive for either of us. By the way, I&rsquo;m able to go toe to toe with her only due to my awakening as a Demon Lord and with the help of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Wisdom King Raphael</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">, and that alone simply reflects what a </span><span class="c1 c14">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hinata is.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But honestly, I believe I&rsquo;m only a few inches away from taking her down. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hinata is indeed strong, but I am now a </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">True Demon Lord</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, so I should be able to suppress her with my body function alone. Yet the result is that we are on par in strength.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata seems to have completely seen through my sword technique, and so she begins to attack without hesitation. Her attacks are swift while still blocking every counterattack I deliver. On top of that, she has even sacrificed her fierce continuous attacks to instead deliver a surprise attack. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If it was me from the past, I would not have stood a chance. This simply means that Hinata didn&rsquo;t displayed her true ability at all during our last confrontation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Should I consider myself lucky?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It seems that I have to give my fullest in this fight if I wish to defeat her.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me</span><span class="c0">, Hinata thinks to herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She wanted to force Rimuru to admit defeat by bombarding him with her sword techniques. Yet Rimuru was able to catch up with her at ease. These are the techniques Hinata spent ten years to master, yet her opponent&mdash;&mdash;completely countered them in an instant.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is a limit to the human body. Only by using magic, abilities, skills and talents</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt73" id="ftnt_ref73">[73]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;can humans obtain the strength to stand against monsters. In contrast however, Rimuru doesn&rsquo;t even need to breathe.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No stamina consumption means there is no need to restore mana, nor will his muscle tire out.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Hehe, I only get to realize how cruel reality is when standing on the battlefield against him&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata thinks to herself, sighing at her disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She knew very well of the fact that her opponent is a monster. Since this world follows the principle of &ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo;, the important thing for her to do now is to gather all the factors that may ensure her victory. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hinata utilized her </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Mathematician</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to enhance the speed of her senses a thousands &nbsp;times more than usual. Her perception of the surrounding area has also exceeded the human limit. Her brain is functioning at its maximum capacity, causing the microvessels in her body to have burst a few times. She took care of the wounds by using an automatic regenerative spell to hide these injuries from her opponent&rsquo;s detection. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Under this state, Hinata feels as though the world has become stationary. Yet it is still not enough. Hinata activates </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Prediction Simulation</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Mathematician</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to predict the path of Rimuru&rsquo;s attack. Hinata has to strike without holding anything back. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, her opponent Rimuru still seems to be holding back. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata wiped her bleeding nose so that her opponent didn&rsquo;t notice before adjusting her disordered breathing. Holding like this for too long alone would already mark Hinata&rsquo;s defeat. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even though she has reached the level of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Saint</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, Hinata is still bounded by the limits of a human body. She has to overcome a higher wall in order to become a semi-spiritual-life-form. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Her trusted </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Usurper</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is rendered useless due to the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Interference</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. It has absolute advantage over the strong&mdash;&mdash;But now, it is no longer useful. Then, she will have to defeat Rimuru with only the skills she has trained during all those years&hellip;&hellip;. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The sword gifted by Ruminas possesses immense power. If it is installed with Hinata&rsquo;s mana and enchanted with her fighting aura, it can cause lethal wounds that can&rsquo;t be treated by any average regenerative ability. Even against enemies possessing </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ultra-Speed Regeneration</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, this sword can cut them in half.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">That&rsquo;s why all I need to do is to cut off one of his arms.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hinata thinks to herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She won&rsquo;t kill Rimuru. The duel will be over if Rimuru is willing to admit Hinata as the victor.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet Hinata has not been able to execute this plan.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Through his extraordinary control of dimension and body functions, Rimuru has seen through the pattern of Hinata&rsquo;s attack.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c1 c14">What an incredible growth. But, these all have to do with body functions. You can&rsquo;t follow up with my level of skill.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">His evolution is indeed astounding, yet in terms of techniques, he is just about the same as what she has experienced before. Even for a skill such as Hinata&rsquo;s </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Usurper</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that can rob the opponent&rsquo;s skills, it can only make the user&rsquo;s body memorize the movements of the skill. In order to master the principles of these skills, the amount of repetitive training required would be so much as to cause one to faint.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It seems to be the same case for Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata sees a chance to win. For there is a difference in their experience on the battlefield. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rimuru is clearly lacking in that regard. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata decides to change her tactics as she realizes this in order to give her opponent the false sense of her attacks being random in speed. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words, a feint.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She decides to toy Rimuru in the palm of her hands with the skill she accumulated through her rich experience&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The speed of Hinata&rsquo;s sword suddenly increases.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That flexible sword technique&mdash;&mdash;even with the speed of my senses boosted to millions of times faster, I still have a feeling of uneasiness when Hinata suddenly changes the path of her sword.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Are you kidding me!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I think to myself as I desperately try to catch up to her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is Hinata Sakaguchi. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Although I knows this already, but her title of the Guardian of Mankind is truly not for show. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As we continue our intense battle, I am also observing Hinata.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is a subtle grin on her face as she looks at me with the confidence to win. I can&rsquo;t catch Hinata&rsquo;s movement with my eyes alone.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her eyes are fixated on me almost as if they are a sensor working to perceive every subtle movement of the surrounding. She must have been attacking based on such perception. While maintaining her natural stance, the center of gravity in her body is not shifting outside of her base, making her capable of reacting to every offense of her opponent. She isn&rsquo;t applying any force on her movement and is always in a relaxed state without the need to show any preparational act while she launches a variety of attacks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I have no idea how Hinata is predicting my attacks, perhaps my pattern has been completely seen through by her. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Regardless, I can only desperately evade Hinata&rsquo;s attack by maneuvering around, purely relying on my body functions. It becomes quite clear that my movements are less agile due to that reason. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I will definitely face defeat if I continue to be tricked by her in this way. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My body functions are supposed to be stronger than hers, yet the strange thing is that my attack pattern has completely been seen through by her. Hinata&rsquo;s skills are way beyond me. But even if that was the case, the Hinata in front of me is not getting any careless for that reason.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In contrast to our last encounter, not only the feeling she gives off is very different, but everything about her seems to be different. Her sword skills were enchanted with her fighting aura, so being hit by it would likely result in critical injury.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Answer. The wounds will not be lethal, however, magicule reserves is likely to reduce dramatically.</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As I suspected.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thankfully it won&rsquo;t cause a lethal wound, but I would definitely sustain damage if I fail to block her attack. It would be dangerous for me to get hit by her multiple times in a row.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">According to the analysis of Raphael-sama, that sword also possesses a special ability. Not only does it have the special wavelength to overwrite the natural laws, but it can even break through my </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Multilayer Barrier s</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For real?! I couldn&rsquo;t help but ask this in my mind, but it must be the case since it&rsquo;s stated by Wisdom King Raphael-sensei.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">.......</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Eh? What&rsquo;s going on?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Notice. Next wave of attack is arriving&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That was close, it seems that it is no time for me to ponder.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata&rsquo;s sword is sharp and fierce beyond belief.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She is able to control her rapier at will, turning spurring to slashes fluently at ease. Moreover, Hinata&rsquo;s swordsmanship is very sound. She is not relying on any fancy techniques or magic, but is relying on her mastery of sword alone. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In fact, only Hakurou would qualify to be able to confront me with a sword other than Hinata. But unfortunately, Hakurou probably won&rsquo;t be able to win. Their basic strengths are too different.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Considering all these, Hinata is almost a battle genius.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Any average attack can&rsquo;t possibly defeat her. For instance, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Clone</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;will be completely useless against an opponent like Hinata. Only the main body is capable of using the Ultimate Skills. In other words, the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Clone</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that serves as the projection of yourself would at most be able to utilize Unique Skills. It will likely be instantly destroyed by Hinata.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if I copy Souei&rsquo;s </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Clones</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to equip them with essential skills, they would not be able to react to every one of these changes without being harmed. If that&rsquo;s the case, they would not be able to stand against Hinata.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I should stay away from using any trick to avoid revealing any openings to her. Although it would turn this into a protracted battle, it is better to wait until Hinata exhausts her stamina. After all, I don&rsquo;t really get tired.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even though this is how I plan, Hinata&rsquo;s attack speed suddenly increased once more. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In fact, that&rsquo;s not accurate. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I couldn&rsquo;t even see its movement clearly. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I always evade based on the path of the sword I see, yet she launches her pursuing attacks almost as if she has seen through the mode of my movements.

And so, during my confrontation with Hinata, it has helped me to learn this skill through analyzing Hinata&rsquo;s attacks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Eh, is this really possible?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Answer. True.</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It seems to be viable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Well, since I&rsquo;ve learnt the skill, such an explanation should not have been a bluff.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I need to apply it right away.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Suddenly a few trails of light appear before my eyes. It is a sort of sensation, or rather they are physically emerging in my mind? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One of the light trail suddenly starts to glow.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I swing my sword to hit that light, and interestingly, I was able to successfully block Hinata&rsquo;s sword.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It seems that these light trails indicate all the possible paths of attacks that the enemy can go for under the circumstance with the attacks following the direction of the trails. I tried it for several more times and discovered that sometimes the light trails would not glow.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This indicates that it is unable to predict the incoming attack path, meaning that it will be a complex attack from the enemy. In simpler terms, low level attacks such as a feint can all be predicted. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But since Hinata has mastered the art of sword, she was also able to strike out unpredictable attacks. The terrifying property of this skill is not its ability to predict, but that whatever it predicts is destined to happen. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It is not a prediction of an attack that is most likely to occur, instead, once successfully predicted, the attack will definitely land on the predicted path.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In other words&mdash;&mdash;Hinata can no longer defeat me. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her feints are no longer feints, or rather, it is a trick that would bring her own demise upon her.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m going to win&mdash;&mdash;!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">With swift movements and without any delay or hesitation, I try to evade Hinata&rsquo;s sword through the passage instructed by </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Predict Future Attack</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was a hunch. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That it would be a fatal misstep to continue her current pattern of attack&mdash;&mdash;An unknown sixth sense is tempting in Hinata&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata has always enjoyed doing things in orderly fashion. She doesn&rsquo;t act without a basis or rationale, yet right now she has chosen to put faith in her instinct. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And so she was saved. It was fortunate that Hinata forcefully changed her path of attack as soon as she launched a feint. More precisely, she was able to successfully attack by charging her body into Rimuru directly.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rimuru also showed a surprised expression, but then raises his sword uncaringly at Hinata again. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata also points her rapier at Rimuru. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, something is not right.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The feeling that Rimuru is giving her is completely different now. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata tries to launch a feint. It was an attack that can be easily blocked, yet Rimuru ignores it and slash directly at Hinata. The way he acted without hesitation raises doubts for Hinata that he has seen through her pattern.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c14">&mdash;&mdash;Coincidence?

Although my sword skill is above him, he however has superior abilities to make up for his flaws. Now any average attack would not be of use. If that&rsquo;s the case&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hinata is very calmly comparing herself to Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Right now her chance of victory is surprisingly low.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Stalling for any longer would prove to be beneficial for her enemy&mdash;&mdash;It was precisely because of this reason that she tried to resolve the fight sooner, yet this is how things have turned out to be.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She must abandon naive thoughts such as holding herself back to prevent taking lives in order to defeat such an opponent. Hinata has come to realize this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then, there is only one way left&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She must sacrifice her ultimate move that she is not supposed to use, in order to achieve victory.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She starts things over by distancing herself from Rimuru. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As time progresses, the people fighting in the surroundings are also in stalemate.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Suddenly, time seems to have been frozen as everyone drops their work at hand and soon begin to observe the battle between Hinata and Rimuru. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Neither of them can strike at their opponent. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For both of their predictions are extremely accurate that their opponent&rsquo;s next move would be predicted before they even try to execute it. The only thing in motion is time as every second passes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Under such circumstance, Hinata speaks up.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;Rimuru, I have a proposal.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What is it?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Let us decide the outcome of our battle with my next strike.

There is a faint blush on her pure and smooth white skin. This young lady sighs with overwhelmed emotion.</span></p><p class="c45"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Ah, how beautiful. Ah&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Privately, it is a personal hobby for her to enjoy watching and caressing the girl in the frozen coffin.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This petite silver-haired young lady.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She has a pair of heterochromatic eyes&mdash;&mdash;One blue, one red, each glows with seductive shine.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">They are eye-catching even when contrasting to her incredibly beautiful face, making the young lady&rsquo;s beauty even more outstanding. </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">However, her most eye-catching features are none other than&mdash;&mdash; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The two white fangs slightly emerging from the young lady&rsquo;s cute lips. When she opens up her petite lips, the crimson blood-like tongue would appear alongside her white fangs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">She is the ruler of dark nights, </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Queen of Nightmares</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;Demon Lord Ruminas Valentine.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Every time she touches this frozen coffin, a burn-like scar appears on Ruminas&rsquo; beautiful body. </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">For this is a holy ark. It is a container for pure energy of the Holy Spirit, and so Ruminas would naturally sustain injuries. As a Vampiric Demon Lord, this coffin is undoubtedly poisonous to her.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">And yet, Ruminas doesn&rsquo;t mind it at all.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">These injuries are the utmost joy to her. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Even with the immense power Ruminas possesses as a Demon Lord, she would not be able to destroy this coffin.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Since Ruminas dreams of one day liberating the young girl slumbering within, she has come to tease with her at the frozen coffin again&hellip;&hellip;. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">It was then that her trusted subordinate brings the news.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">My most sincere apologies for interrupting you, but there is something I need to report.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The one reporting is Louis. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">He was granted the position of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Pope</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in Holy Empire Ruberios under Ruminas&rsquo; rule.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruminas suppresses her displeasure&mdash;&mdash;Since Louis seldom comes looking for her, so it must have been something extremely urgent. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I see it is Louis who&rsquo;s caused all the fuss. What is it?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Louis explains briefly to Ruminas&rsquo; question. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hinata wished to resolve things with Rimuru, which I permitted.

While Gunther governs the Night Garden. As well as the now deceased Roy who disguised himself as the enemy to act as the Demon Lord&rsquo;s double.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Among their other duties, the three work as Ruminas&rsquo; bodyguard in shifts.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Given that Ruminas is staying in the crypt of Night Garden, it is Gunther who is guarding by her side. He dresses Ruminas. You can tell the formality of their dress code given that they are not using magic to dress instantly. </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">As he is helping Ruminas, Gunther heatedly scolds Louis.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">How bold of you to interrupt Ruminas-sama with such trivial matters&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">My sincerest apologies.

If Hinata is killed, Ruminas-sama would&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">At the end of her patience, Ruminas comes between the two to stop the quarrel.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Louis, cut your words short, and you too Gunther. Won&rsquo;t it be fine if I move out myself?

But there is no time for that now. You two should both come with me for now.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruminas commands with majesty and begins to move out. </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Understood,</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I shall pledge my service.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The two Majin obey happily as she leads them away. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruminas suddenly pauses in her tracks. She turns back to the holy cabinet containing her slumbering beloved. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c1 c14">Just you wait&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruminas whispers the name of her dear young girl. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">With her words said, she caresses the crypt gate with pity and seals it down tightly. Being sealed by Ruminas&rsquo; powerful magical barrier, the crypt sinks into &nbsp;the pitch-black void&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">A leader of the secret organization </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Cerberus</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;Damrada of</span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Wealth</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;has arrived in Farmus Kingdom following his secret meeting with the five elders. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He is travelling to the Nedler territory located at the border.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He is on good terms with Earl Nedler Mcmunn thanks to the frequent gifts he sent. These efforts gained the trust of the covetous Earl. And Damarade was able to sneak his men into the city through bribing alone. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Now that he has learned where Edmalis is hiding in the city, it won&rsquo;t be long before this land becomes the ground zero of chaos. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s also been confirmed that the new king Edward has led an army of &nbsp;twenty-thousand men to form camp near the domain of Edmalis. The Hero Youmu is sheltering King Edmalis&mdash;&mdash;They will have the new king Edward spread this as a public announcement of a collusion between the two. He will also emphasize on the claim that Edmalis has signed the treaty of ceasefire without authorization. And now that the new king has gained control, Edward will not carry out the accord.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">However, he will have to demonstrate his &ldquo;good faith&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;through claiming to the public that Edmalis and Youmu have embezzled the reparations.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">To the people living in cities, a hero who can only fight wars is of no use for them. Since they live much safer lives than those by the border, they do not understand the necessity of a defensive force. Some are even bitter over their taxes being wasted on these heroes who do nothing. Considering the amount spent on the citizens&rsquo; personal safety, their lack of such common sense is truly laughable.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Now, with the news out that the Hero Youmu and old king Edmalis have seized the reparations, the upper echelons of the Farmus Kingdom are infuriated. There are increasingly more people volunteering themselves to aid the new king in their capture. Everyone now believes that Edward is the justified one, and so he has exploited this public opinion to lead the army.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">If this continues, Youmu and Edmalis would be defamed and executed. It&rsquo;s obvious that the two would not stand for this. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The threat of war is looming over this place.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">And it&rsquo;s all according to Damrada&rsquo;s plan.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This land originally only had Youmu&rsquo;s five thousand soldiers, yet three days ago, more reinforcements started arriving.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Hmm, of course Demon Lord Rimuru would not allow Youmu to meet his demise like this. Naive, how terribly naive. In that case, Hinata the Saint&rsquo;s odds are looking good. Then, it may be time for me to withdraw&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">To Damrada however, this is also within his expectations.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">It was only his personal wish to take care of Hinata. Since the lies he told to Hinata may have been revealed, he wants to get rid of her before she becomes a problem. She won&rsquo;t let Damarada walk free. And if he is to continue to act among the Western Nations, he has to keep that in mind. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">With that being said, the issue concerning Hinata will have to depend on the Five Elders. This opponent is perhaps too dangerous for Damrada to take on directly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Never mind. As long as our plan doesn&rsquo;t fail&hellip;&hellip; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The head</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt76" id="ftnt_ref76">[76]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Cerberus</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">only ordered him to stir war in this land. In other words, his mission has been completed. It is best for him to withdraw before Hinata returns.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But his work is not done yet - Though Damrada doesn&rsquo;t care whether the new king or the hero triumph, he will need to carry out the promise made with the Five Elders. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">That is to eliminate the demon&hellip;&hellip; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The plan has already changed as things have developed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">According to the investigation of the meetings by Earl Nedler, it seems that the demon also wants to resolve the war in short period of time.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">What should he do now&mdash;&mdash;Damarada begins to ponder.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The new king&rsquo;s goal, the demon&rsquo;s motive. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The two are in direct opposition. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The new king does not wish to antagonize Demon Lord Rimuru. Their difference in military strength is night and day. He will not be able to win even with his whole country on the march. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Yet Demon Lord Rimuru is reinforcing the Hero Youmu, meaning he doesn&#39;t mind a war. The new king&rsquo;s claim of upholding justice became meaningless the moment that the Demon Lord decided to help the old king.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The situation has changed. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Moreover, something else has been on Damrada&rsquo;s mind. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">While investigating for the demon elimination task, he discovered that the Majin Larzen has not been serving the old king, but is under the order of this demon that Damrade is to kill.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">It means&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;could it be that the Majin Larzen was not defeated by Demon Lord Rimuru, but by the demon under Rimuru&rsquo;s command? Then it can&rsquo;t possibly be the incarnation of any contemporary or modern</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt77" id="ftnt_ref77">[77]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;breed of Archdemon. It must be some more ancient demon&hellip;&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Damrada&rsquo;s face stiffens upon thinking so.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">There isn&rsquo;t enough information. Even the information received from his boss doesn&rsquo;t have anything about this type of demon. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He should consider it as modern breed that has lived at least hundreds of years&hellip;&hellip;. Damrada concludes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Among Archdemons, their power varies depending on the years and age they were born. The breeds that were born in recent years may be fine to deal with, but the modern breeds that have lived for two or three hundred years would make a fierce foe to rival the power of a Calamity Rank threat. Moreover, if it is the medieval breed of demon that has lived for nearly a thousand years, its power would be similar to that of a Demon Lord&rsquo;s lieutenant. Even if it is evolved from Lesser Demon, its power is still not to be underestimated.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Once such a demon is born, it will pose very a challenging threat to mankind.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">By the way, the most powerful breed of demon that would even acknowledge a &nbsp;human contract is the medieval breed. Summoning any demon higher than that would only bring destruction. A successful summoner would be out of luck and can only wait to be deprived of their souls by the demon. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">According to the latest research of the Eastern Empire, it has become common sense to set a limit during summoning. However, the only people who are capable of summoning Archdemons the few &ldquo;Hero&rdquo; class</span><sup class="c1 c11"><a href="#ftnt78" id="ftnt_ref78">[78]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;masters&hellip;..</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">With that being said, if it is Majin Larzen&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Damrada couldn&rsquo;t help but mutter.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Indeed, the name of Majin Larzen is quite well-known even in the Empire side. His power should not lose to any medieval breed demon. If a demon who is able to defeat the powerful Larzen does exist&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Besides, the Five Elders seem to be plotting something as well. Damrada is interested in their plan, but his instincts tell him that getting any more involved would be dangerous.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;d better get away before I get caught up in anything&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He plans as such.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Damrada-sama, what is going on?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Damrada&rsquo;s subordinate notices him talking to himself and asks.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Damrada slants his eye at the subordinate and grins.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hehehehe, how dangerous. I can&rsquo;t continue this charade.

They are specialists in battling demons who only earned their license for being the toughest among monster fighters. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Damrada has spent a fortune hiring them from his home country to have them demonstrate their strength on this land.

We won&rsquo;t make back our investment this way&hellip;&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hell if I know. Maybe I&rsquo;m just overthinking it, but I trust my instincts. I&rsquo;m not stupid enough to to lose my life over a maybe.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I apologize if I&rsquo;ve offended you just now. I shall go prepare for our departure.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Alright, I will go pack another gift for the new king.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">With nothing else to be said, his subordinate exits the room.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Now that they&rsquo;ve properly prepared, it is time for Damrada to leave Nedler&rsquo;s territory. </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">It is the right call. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">At this crucial point of time, Damrada has escaped this dangerous land that&rsquo;s been locked on by the raging eyes of one very angry demon.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">New king Edward can&rsquo;t hold in his excitement. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">With the unstopping aid arriving from nobles around the kingdom, his military power is gradually increasing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t expect the Hero Youmu&rsquo;s decision to support his elder brother Edmalis, and when Demon Lord Rimuru reinforced Youmu with troops, he prepared himself for the plan to fail. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Yet even so, God has not abandoned Edward. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The situation changed when Archbishop Rayheim was murdered. He didn&rsquo;t expect that Saint Hinata would move to confront Demon Lord Rimuru. It&rsquo;s rumored that she is marching alongside the Holy Knight Order. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Moreover, the heroes of Holy Empire Ruberios have volunteered to assist Edward. They are the Pope&rsquo;s Imperial Guards&mdash;&mdash;Including the legendary </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Three Martial Sages</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;who are surpassed only by Hinata. These people have mobilized the Templar Knight Order to join in his battle.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Although they have yet to proclaim their enemy as the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Nemesis of God</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, it seems that it is only a matter of time before it becomes official. The group&rsquo;s main goal is to hunt down the demon that murdered Archbishop Rayheim, however, that is merely an excuse&mdash;&mdash;Edward deduces that their true intention is to form a grand alliance, the so called United Army of Western Nations in order to battle against Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">For this reason, Edward has given them permission to conduct whatever they wish in Farmus Kingdom, even military operations. He personally does not wish to fight against Demon Lord Rimuru, but it hardly matters at this point of time.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Hinata can&rsquo;t possibly lose to the Demon Lord, and with such a mighty army, even the Demon Lord&rsquo;s army will be defeated&mdash;&mdash;This is Edward&rsquo;s conclusion. The problem is Veldora&hellip;&hellip;. If it really is that carefree and temperamental evil dragon, the Western Saints Church should be moving all its force to seal it again.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The only thing left is justification, but that question is resolved as well. Some powerful </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Eastern</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Merchant has visited Edward and provided him a letter from Earl Nedler. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The letter states a request for Edward to &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; him.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Now that all the problems have been resolved, Edward is confident of his victory.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">With the reinforcement arriving at the border of the kingdom and the justification of rescuing Nedler, he should move now. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He made the decision without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He is not actually going to war, but the deployment of the army in the streets and around the city will pose quite the menacing effect. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">It is Edward&rsquo;s misfortune that no one was there to advise him.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He gives the order to march.</span></p><p class="c17 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c14">The plan has been drastically altered</span><span class="c0">, Glenda thinks to herself.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But this is quite common on the battlefield. It is important to quickly adapt and turn the situation for the better.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thinking in that direction, things are in fact not too bad.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Every Kingdom is very concerned about the development of this incident, and many reporters have gathered. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The situation is prepared according to the plan. Although they never expected that Rimuru would split his army while dealing with Hinata, it only helped Glenda as he diverted his military force. He has made the wrong move, Glenda concludes. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In essence, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any issue. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Damrada seems to have escaped, but he has left a team specialized for demon slaying to King Edward as a token of friendship. She is looking forward to the performances of these fierce warriors above Rank A.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Good, I&rsquo;ll just use them as disposable pawns then.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Glenda awaits her order casually like that.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Her confidence in defeating the demon has kept Glenda optimistic.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">However, said confidence will not last long&hellip;&hellip; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Kufufufufu</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Diablo, the demon&mdash;&mdash;laughs evilly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">His wide-spread wings are like those of a bat, demonstrating a wicked sight.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He is searching the battlefield from the sky to find the person who framed him. Diablo would not permit such embarrassment of himself in front of his beloved master Rimuru. He has never experienced the taste of fear since his birth, yet the thought of losing his job sends a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c14">If Rimuru-sama says </span><span class="c2 c14">&#12300;</span><span class="c1 c14">You can go back now</span><span class="c2 c14">&#12301;</span><span class="c1 c14">&nbsp;again</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;He shivers at the thought. Imagining it alone is already painful, more painful than having his body torn apart.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Those people who caused him such fear will know his true colors.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Diablo&rsquo;s laughter intensifies upon thinking so.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">And soon Diablo discovers Edward, the new king, at the back of the formation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">There are also several individuals who stand out from the rest. But to Diablo, they are no more than street trash.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">However, they seem to be worthy of standing before Diablo&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c1 c14">Then they must be the </span><span class="c2 c14">&#12300;</span><span class="c1 c14">Ten Great Saints</span><span class="c2 c14">&#12301;</span><span class="c15 c1 c14">&nbsp;or something.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Had it not been for Rimuru&rsquo;s hope that his force would </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">avoid harming the innocent</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, this would be much easier&hellip;&hellip;. Diablo is not alone in thinking this - even Hakurou who is supposed to monitor him, agrees.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Of course, Diablo wouldn&rsquo;t harm the soldiers who don&rsquo;t intend to resist, but it&rsquo;s different for those who attack him. Moreover, he has no mercy for fools who launch an attack without considering their comrades.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Suppressing his eager mood to &ldquo;greet&rdquo; them, Diablo informs Hakurou through </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Telepathy Net</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hakurou-san, there is someone quite unusual heading towards your direction.

He launches himself towards his prey. </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">New king Edward freezes as Diablo appears in front of him.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sare - who he was tasting red tea with - is no exception, the sudden occurrence catching him off guard.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Greetings everyone, I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ve been acquainted. Though, &nbsp;King Edward, I should say it&rsquo;s been a while. My name is Diablo.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Diablo descended from the sky, not forgetting to greet the two by bowing afterward.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Everyone spread out! Raise your guard and protect King Edward!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The knight commander commands out loud, not allowing Diablo finish his greeting.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">On the order, the Imperial Knights quickly carry Edward to the back. A wall of men is formed to protect them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The knights of the Pope&rsquo;s Imperial Guards put up their guard and entered formation as soon as they saw Diablo. They push themselves forward before Edward and the rest.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Diablo remains silent and relaxed while waiting for these panicked bunch to finish their preparation. Now that he&rsquo;s knows his target, the rest is simple. That&rsquo;s why there is no need for him to rush.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The campsite is set up with military tents. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Diablo now stands before the luxurious-looking tent reserved for the king as Sare and his subordinates quickly surround him. Yet Diablo still seems to have a delighted expression as no one notices the fury burning in his eyes. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The reporters are all scared out of their wits, wanting to know what is going on. Diablo&rsquo;s smile to them doesn&rsquo;t weaken.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I have no intention of harming you so long as you be a doll and stay put.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">With that, Diablo puts his fingers together with a crisp </span><span class="c1 c14">snap</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Upon making the sound, the reporters are all surrounded by </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Barrier</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;This is Diablo&rsquo;s attempt to prevent them from being affected. The intention behind his words are </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t call me ruthless if you dare step out of that barrier</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">. But the reporters are happier not realizing so.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The preparation is done, and Edward has come back to his senses.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Why if it isn&rsquo;t Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s honorable envoy?

Then, without faltering, she then plunged a black dagger into the demon.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The dagger heads directly towards Diablo&rsquo;s heart.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Huh!

The difference in power is simply too great, and all of Glenda&rsquo;s actions have been in vain. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She begins to realize this&mdash;&mdash;or rather has known it from the start. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">And so Glenda&rsquo;s actual goal is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Being left with no choice now, Sare can only make his resolve.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He doesn&rsquo;t want to leave Glenda to fight all by herself. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">First, he releases his spirit power, pushing his body to its limit.

Just as Diablo said, she fled the scene.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">God dammit&mdash;&mdash;!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sare bellows in order to rid himself of the frustration, but there&rsquo;s nothing he can do.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sare has to clean up Glenda&rsquo;s mess for having acted out on her own. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Although he is furious, right now he is still confronted with this grinning demon. Considering the circumstances, Sare should be more concerned about his own well-being than Glenda&rsquo;s desertion.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c1 c14">I&rsquo;ll fight then, I&rsquo;ll fight the damn fight! I just have to hold on until Grigori gets back!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Hoping for his trusted ally to return, Sare lights his fighting spirit once more.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Grigori only went to the town to lure out the demon, with his target here, it won&rsquo;t be long until he returns. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sare is certain of this, and so he commences his own desperate battle, albeit with almost no hope of victory.</span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">While Sare is knee deep in battle, another member of the </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Three Martial Sages</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">, Grigori has also gotten himself in a desperate spot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Galloping through the battlefield, he was nearly crushed by a disaster falling from the sky in front of him.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The mercenaries hired by Youmu are fighting to defend the town gate. They&rsquo;re good enough to hold off the vanguard assault.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">However, they are not Grigori&rsquo;s prey. He didn&rsquo;t consider the civil war in Farmus any of his business. His only goal is to hunt down the demon that is said to have murdered Archbishop Rayheim. He has received reports that show that this demon is maneuvering in the city, and so Grigori came in person to eliminate it. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c14">There are people from the </span><span class="c2 c14">&#12300;</span><span class="c1 c14">East</span><span class="c2 c14">&#12301;</span><span class="c15 c1 c14">&nbsp;under King Edward now. If I don&rsquo;t get out there to fight now, there won&rsquo;t be any chance for me to fight at all.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">So did Grigori plan.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But now, instead of the demon, he is confronted by a terrifying giant wolf. He rushes to dismount.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This giant wolf that appeared in front of Grigori is of course Ranga. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He is wagging his tail joyfully while sprinting in the air.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">His body is light as feather. He couldn&rsquo;t feel his feet stomping on the ground and has already unknowingly flown into the sky. This is the skill </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Shuttle Fly</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;only acquired by few beastial monsters, yet he has picked up the skill naturally. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But to Ranga, none of this is important. He has no interest in anything but enjoying this liberating power. He is hopping around the sky with ferocity, displaying the depth of his magicule storage. His dark, furry limbs are covered with sparkling golden lightning. Ranga is not lessening his leaking aura, and is electrifying the air around him. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The horn on his forehead shines with a golden light like a crown as he uses it to control lightning.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">His imposing presence is exaggerated by his charged dark furs, like a cape sewn with darkness, displaying Ranga&#39;s status of the Wolven King. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He was running at supersonic speed in the air and quickly spotted the group as mentioned by Diablo. It didn&rsquo;t take long for him to descend next to Grigori.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Grigori is accompanied by several knights of the Pope&rsquo;s Imperial Guards. The second battalion made up of five thousand soldiers are all Farmus Knights sent as reinforcement by King Edward.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Uh, Grigori-sama, what should we do?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The noble general leading the Farmus Knights asks Grigori.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c14">How should I know</span><span class="c0">. Grigori thinks to himself.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The relatively more skillful knights were all eliminated during the last march, and now all that is left are these crooked soldiers with inferior knowledge who can&rsquo;t even qualify as second class. Expecting them to be capable of thinking is already asking too much. This guy is asking for a foreigner, Grigori&rsquo;s opinion without feeling the slightest bit of shame.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">General Caston, you go handle the troops that are about to arrive. Aren&rsquo;t they both ground and airborne?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Caston understands now that it has been explained by Grigor.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I see.

He witnesses the huge amount of soldier bodies lying in a concentrated area. (D: they are not dead btw) </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The rest of the knights are distancing themselves from Ranga while surrounding him, praying that Grigori would emerge victorious against Ranga.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The fallen soldiers are all skillful veterans. They charged at Ranga in order to cover Grigori, yet were easily defeated in only a couple of hits. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ranga steps on the defeated knights without killing them and sends them flying away with his front legs. That&rsquo;s why a bunch of knights are all lying in the same spot. As for the knights praying on the side, they all look desperate. At first, there were still people energetically cheering, but right now they have all fallen silent.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">That is because&hellip;&hellip; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Grigori is covered in wounds. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Hoping to win at this point is delusional. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Grigori possesses the ideal skill of </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Immovable</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that gives him an indestructible body. Yet to Ranga, he is just a tougher toy to break. Moreover, Grigori cannot faint, and so he is tormented by pain for a long period of time.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hold on! This doesn&rsquo;t look good, Ranga-san!

I have no clue what their goal is, but it would seem they&rsquo;ve not come for me, but Hinata. Perhaps it won&rsquo;t work in their favour if Hinata is still alive.

He may even be one of its members. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The culprit that shot at Hinata must have been this Gerald.

strict with his money and refuses to reduce himself to flattery, even with the most prominent nobles&mdash;&mdash;These kinds of comments about him are common across Brumund Kingdom, and are even known to the people of Ingracia.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">However, in reality, Myourmiles is hardly a cruel and ruthless man. He has a surprisingly loyal and caring personality.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He allocates work to those in poverty and orphans to ensure their basic welfare. To allow loan borrowers to work for what they cannot pay back&mdash;&mdash;Myourmiles explains. Speaking of which, it is Myourmiles who&rsquo;s been organizing extra work for those who can&rsquo;t work for the Freedom Association.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">It is because of Myourmiles&rsquo; real identity that puts him in good terms with many influential people, including the royals of Brumund Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Since it would be more convenient for him to accept work contracts, he has made favors and indebted others in many places. It is with these, it&rsquo;s a piece of cake for him to earn favors from the nobles through debt collecting.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Because of this, Myourmiles has been able to firmly accumulate power and strengthen his territory. Through this, he was able to earn his place and voice in Brumund Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve come to Brumund Kingdom to meet this prominent businessman Myourmiles.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">For two goals this time:</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">To get more manpower in order to officially set off the hotel operation, and additionally, letting him help me collect food ingredients.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">In terms of manpower, the Goblins under my rule are well trained in customer service with Besta&rsquo;s guidance. The quality of their service could probably satisfy high-class visitors such as Duke Galabia or King Gazel.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">However, the money-managing staff fall short due to their lack of talent.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">It will take at least a couple of months to even teach them elementary arithmetic. It&rsquo;s a time-consuming process for these guys, so they can&rsquo;t just pick up skills by studying in their free time during work. But it&rsquo;s only natural, considering that these Mamono have never needed to study before in their life.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;re a bunch who have good muscle memory but lacking in brain-power.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The capable ones can simply obtain skills by feeling like doing so. Those who aren&rsquo;t as capable have to learn through doing hard work themselves, and gaining experience manually.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">As the latter method would undoubtedly be met with failure, we realized we would need to find backup personnel.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">And so I decided to pay a visit to Myourmiles since he&rsquo;s well-known among merchants to be good at accounting.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">However, the real goal of my visit is to get him help me gather new ingredients to develop new cuisines to market. For instance, the ramen from our last meeting. Not the instant noodle type&mdash;&mdash;but the real deal.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Cake also exists in this world as well. If I&rsquo;m thorough enough, I can find it somewhere. I&rsquo;m hoping Myourmiles can find out about this type of stuff for me.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">If all attempts fail, then it would be time for Raphael sensei to do her thing.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12298;</span><span class="c1">Answer.

Necessary ingredients are&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12299;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fufufufu, sasuga, SASUGA RAPHAEL-SAN.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The ingredient needed for ramen start to show up in my head non-stop.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">All of the necessary ingredients have been marked with their places of origin with perfect accuracy.The only thing that remains is collecting them.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;s the problem.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Residents in my country do not have permits to enter other countries.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Although I&rsquo;m fine being an adventurer, no one else can go and import foods to my country.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">This is another significant challenge.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">So I&rsquo;ve come to discuss with Myourmiles about it.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I quickly head to his shop in Brumund. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Myourmiles-kun, I&rsquo;ve come to play~!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I greet rather casually, lifting the curtain and enter the rather luxurious entrance.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But at that instant&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oi brat, where do you think you are running into?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">My greeting only attracts a yakuza (mafia) looking clerk. A few others like him show up from the back of the shop after hearing noises outside.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ehh, isn&rsquo;t this strange? I came in casually because Myourmiles said, &ldquo;You can drop by anytime you want, Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Myourmiles&mdash;&mdash;kun??? My ass! You goddamn brat, how dare you address Myourmiles-san in that manner!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oi, don&rsquo;t you know you&rsquo;ll get your ass kicked with that kind of attitude?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">We won&rsquo;t let it slide even if ya start to cry, ya bastard!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">They all show the same expression and shouting rude things to me.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Are they all some chinpira (thug) from the same street? I kind of want to complain.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Aiya, I&rsquo;m truly sorry. I was told to drop by anytime so&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You piece of shit! Myourmiles-san won&rsquo;t ever give a brat like you a second look!!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hehehe, mah, she looks pretty cute though; are you planning on tricking Myourmiles-san?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Sorry kid, that guy likes women who&rsquo;s busty and tight in the right places! He won&rsquo;t ever take you with just a pretty face.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You really shouldn&rsquo;t go tricking people. But, we wouldn&rsquo;t mind </span><span class="c1 c14">having some fun</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;with you.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">My words are being overlapped by the clerks&rsquo;. And I&rsquo;m getting angry with some of the thugs giving me disturbing looks at the wrong places.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Fellows, I&rsquo;m Myourmiles-kun&rsquo;s friend, you know?! Also, I&rsquo;m a man, not woman. And I&rsquo;m not planning to trick him in the first place!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I straighten my chest and announced this to stand my ground.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Mah, though I was going to borrow some money from him this time&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">However, this would be a great deal for him as well.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Myourmiles seems to have earned great profit through the healing potions trades, which was an idea I came up for him in making money.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Through the sale of healing potion in the country he got to develop new industry in the local area. And through these new industries he came up with new merchandise.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">To put it nicely I&rsquo;m here to persuade him into financing me, in other words, to try and trick his funds. I&rsquo;d be happy, Myourmiles&rsquo;d be happy. And so we may make a lot of money with this idea and maintain a win-win relationship in mind. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Normally, &ldquo;chance to make some money&rdquo; would probably make one suspicious.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I would definitely say no to that. &ldquo;Absolute money maker!&rdquo; If anyone ever says that, they are 100% considered con-artists instantly.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">HOW-EVER!</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">This time, it&rsquo;s truly profitable. It will definitely make money since even Raphael sensei also agrees it will be profitable.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">This time, I will definitely convince Myourmiles and let him accept it.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">This is absolutely not fraud, my conscious does not hurt at all.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">And it is for that reason I could respond feeling justified&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Shut up! Who are you trying to fool here?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Talking apparently won&rsquo;t work, ya want me to use my buddy here to sort things out for you?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">These people won&rsquo;t even listen at all, and there stands a guy trying to intimidate me with sword sheathed around his belt.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Ah ah, this is really&hellip; I sigh internally.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">It really can&rsquo;t be helped since I&rsquo;m not familiar with Myourmiles&rsquo; underlings. It would seem I could only communicate with brute force&mdash;&mdash;as I was going to give up, someone familiar entered from the back of the shop.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oi, what the hell are you all fighting over in front the shop!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I turn to the direction of the voice, there stands a man I miss&mdash;&mdash;It&rsquo;s Bydd. The man Cabal met in Blumund, the man who once was a con-man.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">After he was hired as Myourmiles&rsquo; bodyguard I met him again in Ingracia kingdom&hellip;. Looks like our fate intertwines again, it would seem he has been formally employed by Myourmiles after that.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yo, isn&rsquo;t this Bydd, how are you doing lately?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ah? I-Isn&rsquo;t this Rimuru-sama! Yes! Thanks to you I, no, I[1] have been doing great! It only matters that Rimuru-sama looks so energetic! !</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Bydd straightens himself upon seeing me and saluted me with a 90-degree bow with great respect.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">What a dramatic guy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s great to know. Speaking of which, these guys won&rsquo;t let me into the shop and it&rsquo;s been a pain. Can you convince them that I&rsquo;m actually Myourmiles&rsquo; friend?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Bydd should be a D+ adventure, I heard afterward that he got levelled up to Rank C. So I suppose he&rsquo;s more sensible than these guys here. I was asking him to help with that in mind and it turned out even smoother than I had imagined.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Y-you guys, do you wish to ruin this store!? That is THE Rimuru-sama!!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">These fellows who were just upset with me all started to tremble on the spot hearing Bydd&rsquo;s shout. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Everyone starts to line up like Bydd and plead guilty to me.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;&#12300;&#12300;</span><span class="c1">We are t-truly sorry!! Please forgive us&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;&#12301;&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">As they shout out the line, they all bow deeply to me.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">There were tears in everyone&rsquo;s eyes. A bunch of grown ass men all trembling out of fear. I initially thought they were just afraid of Bydd, but it would seem they have realized who I am. I didn&rsquo;t expect to scare them like that but after all, I&rsquo;m a demon lord these days.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Myourmiles must have learnt that and told these guys. Then it wouldn&rsquo;t be strange to tremble upon hearing my name alone.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">If I had known that, I should have just told them my name. With this crowd, they will probably just let me pass after hearing my name.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll give these assholes a good lesson afterward but do forgive them for now.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">They lower their heads as he says so, so I had to agree with him immediately.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Yet still, with my pardon, those guys look as if their heads are about to be served on a plate as they are taken away.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Th-that person was the demon lord&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s completely different from what Myourmiles-san&rsquo;s drawing, no?!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re kidding, right? Tell me it&rsquo;s all a lie&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">A-are we getting killed&hellip;...?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;etc.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I seem to have overheard some bizarre thing from their crying, but I would ignore it for now.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hey, hey!

It&rsquo;s an honor that you have visited us!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t be so formal with me, Myourmiles-kun! We go way back after all!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Myourmiles laughs along hearing that happily. His enormous, obese body, a symbol of his wealth, jiggles with his laughter.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But, he is truly an ace merchant.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hahaha, it truly makes me happy to have you say such a thing. So what has Rimuru-sama come for this time?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">As he said so, he immediately switched to a more nervous look and asks me. So I also enter negotiation mode with a grin.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;ve brought something highly profitable for you this time.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oh? And what could that be?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">So basically&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I explain to him in detail while sipping the red tea served by the female clerk from his shop. Myourmiles shows an awkward expression and fell silent after hearing about the development of new merchandise.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Given it is orders from Rimuru-sama who&rsquo;s taken much care of me in the past, whether if it&rsquo;s selecting credible talents or purchasing food materials I would happily take the jobs. However, to find personnel for R&amp;D of new merchandise, that would be&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Myourmiles is a merchant so having him innovating on new food ideas would probably be hard.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Even if he&rsquo;s good at channeling the new products to existing merchandise, to develop new merchandise seems far beyond his abilities. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">However, my goal is only to get the ingredients for the food. After which, we will be taking over.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No, no. We&rsquo;ll cover that part. Myourmiles-kun. I only hope you can transport the ingredients to my town. After the new merchandise are complete, I&rsquo;m planning to supply them to hotels on the road to Blumund. So I&rsquo;ll have to rely on you again for the supply of the ingredients by that time.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I see&hellip;.. In other words, if Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s plan works out, I would get to add new merchandise in my trade. Is that so?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That is exactly the case. If the new merchandise gets popularized, you can also sell them in other stores owned by you.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What! But, wouldn&rsquo;t that cut Rimuru-sama from the monopoly&hellip;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">About that, didn&rsquo;t I just mention about getting financing. Since you&rsquo;ve contributed monetarily already, it is only reasonable to share the profits when it returns.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m not done just after I return the money when the business becomes successful.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I made sure to elaborate on that point. Myourmiles also seems to gradually gain more interest, listening and nodding as I go.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I understand now. Very interesting! Then allow me to assist you!!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Myourmiles then promised me with a plan of financing. He&rsquo;s easier than I imagined</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Kukuku~</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Myourmiles-kun, you are too easy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Since the necessary task is done, I have to ask about something</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Speaking of which, I&rsquo;ve been noticing from just now&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Myourmiles stopped and turned to me as Myourmiles was handing over the contract to confirm with me.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Is there something wrong?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yeah, about that. There&rsquo;s a painting over there on the wall, is that a painting of me?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">In that reception room filled with expensive yet tasteless furnitures just to show off his wealth, only that painting decorating on the wall seems unique and out of place.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The painting depicts a beautiful female confronting a dragon, whose appearance seem way too mature and doesn&rsquo;t match me at all.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Kufufufu, it&rsquo;s exactly that! It is painted by a famous artist according to the scene where you saved me in Ingracia.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Myourmiles seems to have his switch ticked and started to give speeches</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">It would seem he has utilized magic to extract his actual feeling during the time in order to never forget the moving feeling during the time. But seriously, this exaggeration is a bit over the top.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Ehh, but my appearance originally belonged to Shizu-san. So I can&rsquo;t really deny when being called a beauty, but being drawn like this&mdash;&mdash;it makes me look like a goddess glowing with holiness.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oh well, isn&rsquo;t this a little too exaggerated?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Not at all! I think this is hardly sufficient still!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">So I got in a bad spot upon pointing it out, having been refuted by Myourmiles and had him recalling details of his situation at the time enthusiastically. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The female clerk seems rather accustomed to the situation as she came to refill the red tea, it would seem this type of activity is rather mundane.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">On second thought, even if I gave my name to those thugs looking after the shop, they probably won&rsquo;t be able to tell I am Rimuru from the painting.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">After all, if they are used to looking at the adult version of me on the painting, they probably can&rsquo;t imagine the real Rimuru is someone who looks like a kid. Never mind, there&rsquo;s no use concerning myself with that.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I should try to show others my current appearance more from now on so they won&rsquo;t mistaken me again.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Myourmiles followed the contract and purchased massive amounts of food ingredients from different countries. But, should I say as expected? I couldn&rsquo;t find cuisine resembling ramen anywhere.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">So let&rsquo;s proceed as our deal states and develop some new cuisines. </span><span class="c2">&#12290;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">More and more precious and unique ingredients are being transferred.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">My most loyal and efficient chefs will be expecting them at the brand new kitchen.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Among them it&rsquo;s Gobchi, who&rsquo;s been training under Shuna from the start.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He was extremely upset when his kitchen was wrecked by Shion, and I was able to bait him into my scheme under the condition of building him a new kitchen.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">These cuisines can be easily recreated if I ask Shuna for help.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But that&rsquo;s if we choose to rely on Shuna&rsquo;s cooking, there will be too much burden on her at the end of the day.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">So this time I decided to bring in my own development team.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Definitely not hoping to earn some extra cash for myself.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">So, what type of cuisine are we making, Rimuru-sama?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I grin and hand over the product to Gobchi after he asked.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">It is a bowl of Ramen completed within my </span><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">stomach</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I-is this !?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Gobchi swallows his saliva as he stares at the ramen.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Try it out.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes sir, here I go then&hellip;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Gobchi started to taste the ramen upon finishing the sentence. He&rsquo;s rather handy with chopsticks likely due to observation of my usage.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Gobchi nodded to me hard as he takes each bite of the ramen and let its taste sink in.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">This is amazing, Rimuru-sama! This thing will definitely take everyone&rsquo;s heart!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He started exclaiming with joy on his face.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Right? Isn&rsquo;t it delicious?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">This is beyond delicious! So, how in the world do you make this?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ha~Ha~Ha, that would be your job to find that out!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;&mdash;Aiii?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Gobchi&rsquo;s face freezes with confusion hearing my laughing answer. He didn&rsquo;t seem to catch what I mean and kept on blinking as he thinks.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">That is precisely my intent after thinking through.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">It would be meaningless to just produce it with my ability. We have to find out the recipe step-by-step. This is precisely why I&rsquo;ve summoned you. But your surprised look is really giving me a headache now.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Listen Gobchi, you can use this kitchen to your heart&rsquo;s content. You get to use everyone of the ten disciples here. And so I hope you are able to find out a recipe of ramen available for everyone with this bowl as reference.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I told him so while teaching him all I know about ramen making.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">How to make the noodles, how to cook the broth as well as other general information regarding ramen making.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But I&rsquo;m completely ignorant on details of its making, so I&rsquo;ll have to rely on Gobchi and his crews&rsquo; efforts.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;in other words, there are things that even Rimuru-sama doesn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&mdash;no&hellip; I get to do whatever I want right?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ve given you a completed version, you just go ahead and research it as a reference to whatever end you wish.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Although I feel conflicted in my heart given how reckless this is, I still feel justified saying so.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">After all, this is the most crucial part of the plan, I&rsquo;d have to forgo regardless of how much of a mess it may lead to.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I plan to recreate even more cuisines from my original world. And I&rsquo;ve chosen Ramen as step one of my keikaku. I can&rsquo;t just give up now!</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Gobchi seems to have read the air and answered to my hope.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I understand. If it&rsquo;s Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s request, I shall attempt it with all my efforts!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Oh oh, you are truly reliable. Good luck, I have faith in you!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">And so Gobchi agreed easily.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He has obtained a new kitchen built by Geld and helped facilitating both my interests and business&mdash;&mdash;no, new commercial endeavour, he seems rather overjoyed by it.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Thank you Gobchi. From now on he will probably work very hard as well, and I only need to wait for results.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">After which, things went smoother than I had imagined. I was able to push the responsibilities entirely onto other people&mdash;&mdash;ingredient purchasing to Myourmiles and the specific cuisine details to Gobchi.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Myourmiles doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about the budget while Gobchi doesn&rsquo;t seem to care for sleeping.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">What about me?</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">My job is to be everyone&rsquo;s back-up (cheerleader).</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Play cute and poke at Myourmiles&rsquo; fat tummy for more money, singing a song to support an exhausted Gobchi.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">As soon as the two show a smile, one would spit out the money while the other would jump up and continue working.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">At last, the three flavours of ramen including Soy sauce, Miso and Pork bone were successfully recreated, alongside with the choice of thick or light broth.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Other merchandise such as dry-fish broth and white chicken broth was also successfully developed.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Amazing! As expected from Gobchi!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hmm, this is indeed delicious. As expected of Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s food suggestion.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m very satisfied and giving out the passing comment. Now this will definitely work well as a merchandise for trading.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Myourmiles who&rsquo;s been called to test taste the food also seems satisfied, commemorating its deliciousness.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Thank you gentlemen! I&rsquo;m now very confident in making ramen.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Hmmhmm, with that spirit I&rsquo;ll rely on you with the remainder of the plan.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Yes si&mdash;&mdash;ah, ARE? Hasn&#39;t the development of Ramen ended already?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s true, Rimuru-sama. We already have so many varieties, it would be more than sufficient to open shops with these, right?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The two express doubts as they both thought the plan is over.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Too na&iuml;ve~</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">How could my ambition be ended with just ramen.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ku~ku~ku, you guys are way too na&iuml;ve. Who ever said that this is the end of my plan?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">AH?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">But&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I interrupted the two with my next ambitious product. The king of home-cooking restaurant, cuisine well known around the world&mdash;&mdash;Hamburger meat desu!</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Th-This is!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Gobchi seems highly motivated again upon seeing the new dish.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Huhuhu, Gobchi, the recipe to this cuisine is not challenging at all. However, it is extremely difficult if you want everyone to make the same flavor of it.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">And what do you mean by that?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">For now figure out some way to train your men in making it with the same flavor! From there, let them develop hamburger meat unique to their own shops.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I see! You wish to have my disciples own their own shops and allow them to compete among each other, right?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I give him a smile after hearing Gobchi&rsquo;s response.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It would seem that you have noticed Gobchi.

With Gobchi&rsquo;s correct interpretation, he may have also sparked ambition in creating his own shop.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">However, Myourmiles who overheard our conversation&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Does this mean, I have to invest more money&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">His face turns pale as he realizes he&rsquo;s going to increase his budget again</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But, you don&rsquo;t need to worry.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Kukuku, Myourmiles-kun, please be reassured! Those fully-developed ramen has already been on sale! Not only within my nation, it has been gaining popularity across the travelling hotels along the roads. I think it&rsquo;s also about time to promote it in Brumund Kingdom.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">S-So!?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, it means is about payback time.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ohohohoh, Sasuga, Sasuga Rimuru-sama!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Indeed, indeed!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Kufufufu, so it will all be fine under Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s care?

In this way, I am able to gain the next deal with Myourmiles as I return the initial fundings. After which, we poured in Myourmiles&rsquo; funds like flowing water and developed new products one by one.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ve also encountered crisis mid-way&mdash;&mdash;our information was leaked to Veldora and we were forced to teach him how to make Takoyaki. But that&rsquo;s another interesting story to tell.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Even if there are losses, they are expenditure on Myourmiles&rsquo; tab.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">And I still continued pushing forward plans without any fear of failure&hellip;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">At long last, we were able to develop a diverse menu of cuisines.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">With different hotels adding to the competitions, the sales kept on growing higher and higher. The initial losses sustained by Myourmiles were also compensated with these numbers.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Kufufufu, I can&rsquo;t seem to stop.

Everything is according to plan!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Please allow me to remain in your care in the future as well, Rimuru-sama!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Most certainly.

There&rsquo;s no need to confirm the content, it&rsquo;s definitely the usual stuff.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ha!

At some point of time and onward, travelers started showing up in the hotels just to taste the food.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Then on these roads, chefs and food-enthusiasts from different nations gather due to their reputation, causing the streets to be occupied fully by different cuisine vendors.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;in the future, these roads were named &ldquo;Roads of delicacy&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Such is the origin of the naming, but I, at the time, would have no idea about that.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">[1] There is a change of prononune from Ore to Watashi to show respect to Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c19" id="h.1pxezwc"><span class="c1 c43">&nbsp;</span><a id="id.49x2ik5"></a><span class="c1 c16">Defeat of the Holy Knights</span></h2><hr><p class="c10 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Upon arriving the capital city Rimuru of Tempest Federation, there has been a drastic change in the situation.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s a sudden surge of fighting spirit indicating a huge battle.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">One of the parties gives off a rather familiar aura. It belongs to the Holy Knight Order vice-commander Reynald[1], who are supposed to defend the nation (Ruberios) while they were out. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">This is quite shocking to the holy knights who have just recently gained hope in resolving the conflict with Rimuru peacefully after weeks of travelling.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But regardless of the situation, they need to go confirm the situation first.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s go!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Hinata shouts and is followed by the rest of the holy knights to the battlefield at full speed.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">There, they witnessed a one-sided crash on the so-called battlefield.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">There were five higher Majins with overwhelming power next to her.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The one that stands out with unparalleled power, it&rsquo;s the Majin that resembles a young girl with moon white hair.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">That Majin is the target of this mission.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The leader of the Tempest Federation, newly appointed Demon Lord&mdash;&mdash;Rimuru, that&rsquo;s it alright.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The proof being that Hinata, who the knights trust, has since fixed her sights on the Majin without moving. It&rsquo;s definitely warranting that it would be an opponent to be on full alert against, even ignoring all the fierce combats occurring on their back.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Regarding that incident, the holy knights got a good strong taste of reality.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Rimuru was the first one to speak. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You sure are bold, Hinata. Regardless of whatever reason you may have, this is still my territory. We could confirm your hostility by this unannounced military activity alone. So I won&rsquo;t be na&iuml;ve enough to sit around for you to strike first. </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;a misunderstanding! Arno, one of the holy knights, thought. But there&rsquo;s no way he can prove it here.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Although Hinata has also already realized that, she still wanted to resolve the misunderstanding through negotiation.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t going well as expected.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Reynald and the rest are still fighting behind them, if this is how it would go on, combat is the only way out.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Then, what could we do?</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Arno tried his hardest thinking about a solution while listening to Hinata&rsquo;s negotiation.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">We shouldn&rsquo;t just be alerted by Demon lord Rimuru, Arno thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The other four Majins.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Every one of them gives off a fierce aura unique to the strong.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Although Hinata mentioned that those are threats of A+ level, her phrasings were likely wrong. Since the only things more dangerous than that are the demon lords and true dragons. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">To be specific, even catastrophe-level monster&mdash;&mdash;Charybdis, which can rival, even exceed the strength of demon lords, is only categorized as Special Rank A. It is simply a rank made for there is a lack of more dangerous existences.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Besides, his comrade Ritase is able to summon a Special Rank A higher Holy Water Maiden Undine (Water Spirit)[2]. Even so, if you ask her whether she could put up a fight against Charybdis, the answer would be impossible.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Even if the ranking is the same, there is still presence of the absolute power gap.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">And then, the Majins in front of them&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">They aren&rsquo;t joking around with their strength written on their faces.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Even though they don&rsquo;t stand tall as something like demon lords or Charybdis, these are still difficult opponents &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Two of the Three Beastketeers, who were trusted aides of ex-Demon Lord Beast King Karion.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Those two are the strongest individuals within the ranks of the famous Beast King Battalion. Their strengths are no small feet.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">And the other two Majins who have been identified as Kjins by Hinata.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Those are powerful monster worshiped by primitive tribes. Between them, especially the red hair seems most unusual. It gives off a special aura among the four.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Even with Arno&rsquo;s eyes he can&rsquo;t see through its strength.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c15 c1 c14">&mdash;&mdash;This is gonna be trouble. How are we supposed to beat Majins with such power? No way we can do it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c15 c1 c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The number matches up as well.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no better way to be sure of their strength than confront them directly. If they are lucky enough, they may even win.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">These are resolves held by every one of the holy knights, so there&rsquo;s no need to make up their mind at this point.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But this time, victory is not a necessity.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s no need for further confrontations other than against Demon Lord Rimuru.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hinata said so.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Right now the situation is rather hard to resolve, but if it&rsquo;s Hinata&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">She definitely would be able to convince demon lord Rimuru&mdash;&mdash;Arno decides to place his absolute faith in Hinata.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Then, what would be his duty? It will be buying time.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Arno is in a party of four.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Same number as the Majins they are against.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">They would more or less be able to buy some time if they take on one each.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Arno decides to take action and interjected Rimuru and Hinata&rsquo;s conversation.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What are you talking about! Do you even know what would happen if Hinata-sama is to take back her stance right now? Why wouldn&#39;t we take precaution when you are the one who called Hinata here?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Whatever excuse would suffice for now. Arno shouted while thinking that to himself one-sidedly. As expected, one of Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinate made a move.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">It happens to be the red-hair that Arno thought is the most dangerous.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c15 c1 c14">What a timing. Please be my opponent now!</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c15 c1 c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">It is a Majin worthy to battle Arno, who&rsquo;s only next to Hinata in terms of strength within the order.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Come on, if it comes after anyone else, they probably won&rsquo;t even be able to buy any time. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Arno pulled out his sword and prepared to swing towards the red-hair.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No killing intent, I see? Good call. Just now if you intended to kill me, you would be lying on the ground by now. </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Of course. To Arno he has no intention to kill the red-hair in the first place. He only wanted to distract the Majin away from Hinata.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But what he said has upset Arno.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Sure, the red-hair is strong. Arno approves that, but he is upset that he dares to treat him as some lower existence and made such arrogant speech.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But I wouldn&rsquo;t know what would happen without a fight.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I wouldn&rsquo;t want to get in the way of Hinata-sama&rsquo;s negotiation. So I decided to make some threat and got this reaction. But it would be rather boring if I&rsquo;m just misunderstood like this.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He observes the red-hair as he argues back. But the red-hair really isn&rsquo;t taking Arno seriously.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You are the one who&rsquo;s misunderstanding.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He seems to have little interest for Arno while saying so.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Now Arno is getting pissed by his attitude. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">If our strength is similar, victor would be depended on luck&mdash;&mdash;Arno thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He won&rsquo;t go down without a fight against an arrogant opponent such as this, even if they are strong.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Huhu, then let&rsquo;s have a little chat somewhere further away.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Very well.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Since we are going to spar one on one, the outcome would be the same even if our intents differ.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Arno thought so and decided to get a little more serious with the red-hair.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Arno has left.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Seeing so, the next to act were the two Beastketeer.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Aren&rsquo;t you guys feeling bored as well? If you don&rsquo;t want to get into Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s way, we can go for a little spar for now. </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ah, ah. The power of the &ldquo;Ten Great Saints&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s what I happen to want to get a taste of</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">They propose towards Fritz and the others, showing their beastly teeth with a provoking smirk.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c14">Good grief, I understand what Arno is planning now. He&rsquo;s trying to distract the Majins to battle in order to let Hinata to focus on dealing with demon lord Rimuru&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Saint of Earth&rdquo; Bacchus has correctly interpreted Arno&rsquo;s thought.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">So was his companion Fritz, who arrived at the same conclusion.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Well then, allow me to oblige.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Bacchus responded that.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Well it can&rsquo;t be helped, I&rsquo;ll join you then.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz also walked forward as well saying so.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c14">As expected of Fritz. Even if he likes to make nonsense talk most of the time, he&rsquo;s definitely reliable under these circumstances.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Bacchus thought to himself. But he became speechless as soon as hearing what Fritz spoke out the very next instance.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Neh neh, big sis, aren&rsquo;t you a lovely lady? Lucky day for me! Ah, my name is Fritz, what about you? You have one, right? Won&rsquo;t you tell me now?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He can&rsquo;t believe Fritz said that to the Beastketeers as if he&rsquo;s flirting with some girls on the street.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c14">I-idiot! How could he do something&hellip; Actually, hold on a moment?</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Bacchus who&rsquo;s been rather confused by his colleague&#39;s frivolous attitude suddenly realizes something.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Although he has believed that the opponents are who he thinks, they&rsquo;ve not announced their names yet.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c15 c1 c14">He is trying to get the identities of the opponents, I see now. You are a clever man too, Fritz.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c15 c1 c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But that was probably just misinterpretation on Bacchus&rsquo; side.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Bacchus decides to go along after recognizing Fritz&rsquo;s &ldquo;wit&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ladies, I apologize for my colleague&#39;s intrusion. We are sort of running late but my name is Bacchus. As you may figure, I am one of the &ldquo;Ten Great Saints&rdquo;, and the captain of the Holy Knight order. I would be looking forward to our duel, but before which could you share your names with us?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Bacchus asked for the opponents names following Firtz&rsquo;s words subtly. The one who responded to his words was the beauty with devilish straight white hair and cat-like eyes.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Fufu, interesting. My name is Suphia. &ldquo;White Tiger Fang&rdquo; Suphia! As you may have figured out, I am one of the three Beasteekeer. Let me have some fun with you now, &ldquo;Ten Saint&rdquo; Bacchus!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Suphia announces herself while moving in front her Bacchus with her extravagant limbs.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The tiger has chosen her opponent.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Bacchus realizes that too and holds tight onto his holy battle pole infused with magical power.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">It would be great if I could meet your expectation.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">He, he, no need to be modest now. I&rsquo;ll even spare your life if you could satisfy me. So how about showing me all your strength? </span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Cease your howling. I&rsquo;ll have you taste the our strength of the guardian of humanity.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Bacchus shouted.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">At the same time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Of course it&rsquo;s just as Hinata-sama has expected. It would seem demon lord Rimuru&rsquo;s party has no intent in confronting us.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">As such he understands it.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">While he was reassured with a strange sensation, his resolve as a holy knight also bursts out of his heart. Since the objective is to buy time, there&rsquo;s no need to fight to the death.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">However, it is precisely for that reason. This moment, now, he should fight with all his strength, Bacchus thought.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Servant of the Western Saints Church, the Holy Knight Order&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;Saint of Earth&rdquo; Bacchus, here to receive you!!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Come at me!!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Bacchus begins combat against Suphia the Beastketeer&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;&#8415;&#8415;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&#8415;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz is trying to confront the fear that has arisen in his heart.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c14">This is bad. Bad, bad, horribly bad. It&rsquo;s Really bad. This is really overwhelmingly horribly bad!!</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He had to move out since Bacchus took action, but should he leave Hinata or not? So thought Fritz.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">His feeling upon seeing demon lord Rimuru&mdash;&mdash;Fear.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Impossible, he realizes he can casually be categorized among the strong.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Arno must have faith strong as steel in believing Hinata&rsquo;s victory.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But of course, Fritz also has faith in her. But even so, there&rsquo;s no way things can be easily resolved if Hinata has to fight that demon lord. Fritz&rsquo;s instinct told him.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Without much proof, Fritz&rsquo;s sixth sense often comes to be useful in situations like this.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He can understand Arno&rsquo;s thoughts. But now since Bacchus has got involved, it&rsquo;s then decided what Fritz has to do. To fight one Beastketeer and buy time.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Arno has confronted the red-hair whose threat is only next to demon lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Then&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The rest of the Majins should be on equal terms against Fritz and the others who are all members of the &ldquo;Ten Great Saints&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Although the Gray-hair Majin who has little presence among the rest has caught Fritz&rsquo;s attention for a while, he has the least amount of Magicule among them.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">So it&rsquo;ll be fine. If it&rsquo;s Ritase who can summon spirits, she would have an advantage fighting by summoning Water Maiden. At least she won&rsquo;t lose.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">And with Fritz and Bacchus, it would at least be a draw against the beasteekeers. The problem is with whether Arno&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c14">No, it&rsquo;s no use to think this hard right now. Arno is stronger than me so it won&rsquo;t be of help even if I worry. Instead I should think of a way to deal with the situation&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz is thinking really hard. He has faith in his companions, so he would instead prioritize how to achieve victory himself right now.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">At that moment, Fritz had an epiphany. This is no place to hesitate.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz made up his mind and spoke to one of the beasteekeers with a sarcastic tone.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Neh neh, big sis, aren&rsquo;t you a lovely lady? Lucky day for me! Ah, my name is Fritz, what about you? You have one, right? won&rsquo;t you tell me now?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The offense that Fritz came up with&mdash;&mdash;It&rsquo;s to confuse his opponents. Then he would be able to distract them and make his first strike count.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Even if he is called despicable, as long as he wins it counts. Fritz has his own inner working besides considering his strength and is cautiously attempting to turn the tide for himself.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But he wasn&rsquo;t attempting to identify the opponents like what Bacchus thought. It may seem frivolous, but Fritz has no time to consider that.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Because of that, Bacchus, who is unaware of it, decided to lead the conversation as if he&rsquo;s taking care after Fritz. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Sorry for the trouble, old man. But does this make me more like an idiot in this way?</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz&rsquo;s chances of victory increase despite it not being his intent.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Bacchus then began to fight fairly as a holy knight of the church.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The opponent must be expecting the same from Fritz because of that.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The name is Alvis. &ldquo;Golden Snake Horn&rdquo;[3] Alvis. Sadly you&rsquo;re not my type.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ayyy, that&rsquo;s a real shame. Then, what happens now? Should we begin?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz looks at Alvis as he says so. A seductive beauty with golden and black hair floating around her head.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Although her eyes are beautiful like jewels, deep down that snake&rsquo;s pupils seem to hide a bottomless abyss.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz observed and was disappointed that Alvis has not let down her guard one bits. The air surrounding her is cruel and cold, and she didn&rsquo;t make a single move upon hearing Fritz&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c14">But it&rsquo;s only natural, this is after all monster who commands the Beast King&rsquo;s army, no way that it will become careless just like this&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But there&rsquo;s no problem even if she disrupted one of his strategies.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The scheme to distract an opponent is not singular, but a consecutive set of tricks that Fritz has prepared &mdash;&mdash; But as he thought so, he experienced a sudden burst of incredible magicule. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He turned his eyes wide towards its source. An earth-shaking shock wave was also sent as soon as he did that.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ara ara, that&rsquo;s Shion-sama. She&rsquo;s so reckless as always&hellip;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Even hearing Alvis&rsquo; words, Fritz did not feel it&rsquo;s any time to be concerning such issue.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Y-you&rsquo;ve got to be kidding!? T-that&rsquo;s Gerald&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inferno Spirit Flame&rdquo;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Magic Detection&rdquo; senses the casting of the most powerful magical attack of his collegue. And more to his surprise, the Majin named Shion was able endure it completely.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Or rather, she straight up cut it in half.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz freezes in shock at the abnormal sights.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">That was a tactical nuclear strike magic: something more powerful than even Heat disintegration, that&rsquo;s likely one of the most powerful magics doable by humans, and even stronger than ultimates of elven magic&hellip;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">However, such an act seems to be dealt with ease by Majin who&rsquo;s not even a demon lord.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s something Fritz&rsquo;s common sense cannot process, an abnormal situation. Yet, such unrealistic sights continue.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The sounds of fierce clashes between weapons travel in the air. The strong wind invoked by the battles struck down the nearby vegetations.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Right now, Arno of the Holy Knight Order, whose strength is only next to Hinata, has been dominating the red-hair Majin with his swordsmanship. And he very much should be.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Ah, Benimaru-sama is truly magnificent. He&rsquo;s so eager to study, even about that person&rsquo;s sword art.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Huh?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz heard the whisper of the seductive woman Alvis in front of him. He couldn&rsquo;t understand the meaning of her words.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The red-hair Majin&mdash;&mdash;Benimaru could only defend against the barrage of elegant yet furious sword attacks. Yet Alvis is only watching Benimaru without worrying about his chances of triumph.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">What are you talking about? It&rsquo;s obvious that it has been Arno&rsquo;s one-sided attack no matter how you look at it.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Learning about sword art? There&rsquo;s no way he has that time to spare.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He won&rsquo;t come out in one piece if he looks down to a genius such as Arno like that. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">It should be like that.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But the problem for Fritz was Alvis&rsquo; silence. She only responded with a cold look at him. The sword and Tachi comes in contact without pausing.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">As the weapons dance front and forth, sparks flew as the two blades clashed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Alvis simply watched in silence at such sight.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Before Alvis turned back her eyes, Fritz couldn&rsquo;t move, with his hands holding tight onto his sword.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">At hindsight, she is full of openings. But it&rsquo;s obviously a dangerous temptation, so did Fritz&rsquo;s sixth sense announce to him.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But as long as he can buy some time, there&rsquo;s no need to rush to attack. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">So thought Fritz, he decides to simply accompany Alvis in this way.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Moments later, Alvis who&rsquo;s been staring at Benimaru&rsquo;s battle suddenly seemed to have lost interest and turned her eyes back on Fritz.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">The battle is over. Of course that man couldn&rsquo;t rival Benimaru-sama.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">No, that would mean Arno&rsquo;s strength in&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Arno should have had the advantage in winning. Yet even so Alvis announced Benimaru&rsquo;s victory by herself.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz who has been upset about this through and through contained the anger in his heart and responded to Alvis. Yet he was stopped by Alvis with a raised hand.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">You are wrong, that&rsquo;s simply how it looks. The battle won&rsquo;t last any longer, and surely you won&rsquo;t be contented with just arguing. How about you and I just spend the time together to see Benimaru-sama&rsquo;s battle to the end.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Even though Fritz still couldn&rsquo;t accept what she said, but it was his intent to request that. He only said that partially out of anger and partially to provoke his opponent.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Well, it won&rsquo;t matter since Arno will definitely come out on top. Is it alright if the tide turns on onee-chan like that?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Yet Alvis laughed at Fritz&rsquo;s provoking words,</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Benimaru-sama, as a matter of fact, is someone who wields flame to consume all. Right now he&rsquo;s only sparing you all for the convenience of his sword practice. If he is to fight seriously, your friend Arno-kun would likely have been vaporized from this world already.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s no mocking words towards a fool, but words out of pity for Fritz. It all sounded very convincing to Fritz.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He had the illusion of having cold sweat flowing down his back. His heart seems to have been grasped by fear.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c14">That&rsquo;s just fear-mongering, my usual tactic. To make me lose my cool and fight without my full strength... I&rsquo;ve heard rumors of &ldquo;Golden Snake&rdquo; Alvis being an intelligent strategist. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if she is to use psychological tactics to shake me&hellip;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Even though if it was a lie, Fritz must convince himself to believe it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no way he could admit that someone would go easy to avoid casualty when confronting them, the strongest existence among men, the holy knight order. Fritz thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Yet the ruthless moment of truth finally arrives&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz doesn&rsquo;t know whether this Majin named Benimaru is actually good at using flame or not, but his swordsmanship is definitely on par with Arno.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He was able to evade every fierce attack by Arno&rsquo;s sword using his giant tachi.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Fu, fufu, it surprises me you are able to evade my attacks to this extent, neh. And deflecting all of them, it&rsquo;s almost as if you are slashing down water.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">That is only natural. My master in sword art taught me the ultimate realm in a sword fight is detecting the &ldquo;flow&rdquo;. If you listen to your sword&rsquo;s sound carefully and become one with the sword, you can see that flow as clear as day. I&rsquo;ve yet to reach that realm, but I&rsquo;ve seen through your sword style.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Horrifying, horrifying indeed. It doesn&rsquo;t seem that you are bragging either. If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ve also made up my mind too. Behold, I shall demonstrate why I am called the strongest among the Holy Knight&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The fight between Arno and Benimaru has entered its climax under Fritz&rsquo;s and Alvis&rsquo; observation. Fritz has only heard of Arno&rsquo;s secret technique. Yet he never had the chance to witness it in real life.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The invisible sword technique that is said to be able to cut down any monster in one slash. It is the strongest sword technique wielded only by Arno, the one adored by five elemental spirits, and whose strength is only next to Hinata.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Behold the magic purifying shine and brand it onto your body. Take this, Five-elemental spirit sword&mdash;&mdash;!!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Arno&rsquo;s beloved sword shines out five beams of light.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Earth, water, fire, wind and air, the spiritual lights of five different elements. All of these beams contract and releases a killing blow which cannot be shielded by any type of defense.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The shining blade plunges towards Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c15 c1 c14">Is this Arno&rsquo;s ultimate&hellip; Mah, I thought he would never show that in front of others. Can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s been pushed to this point&hellip;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c15 c1 c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz thought so while confirming his friend&rsquo;s victory.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">However!</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Na&iuml;ve&mdash;&mdash;Pulse &middot; Slash of Flowing Water!!</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The Majin Benimaru raises his Tachi and swings out without panicking.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">As a result, Arno&rsquo;s shining blow was received gently by Benimaru&rsquo;s tchi.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">His sword blown into the air with the echo of a clear sound.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz wasn&rsquo;t able to see a thing, but it was possible to infer what happened.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">To put it simply, Benimaru&rsquo;s technique was able to destroy the power of Arno&rsquo;s attack. The shock wave of it propagated towards Arno. Having realized that, Arno released his sword out of fear for the wave harming his sword-holding hand.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz couldn&rsquo;t imagine anything else and had to believe that.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c14">In other words, this bastard called Benimaru even mastered a better sword art than Arno!?</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He can&rsquo;t laugh at it even if it&rsquo;s a joke. This is all a nightmarish experience to Fritz&hellip;&hellip; Yet it&rsquo;s all reality.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I told you, your technique has been seen through. Your sword art is still amateurish. But it&rsquo;s possible in terms of its power. But it is pointless if you can&rsquo;t hit your target with it. I&rsquo;d advise you to understand that point.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Benimaru announces these to Arno and sheathed his tachi.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I-I&rsquo;ve&hellip; lost&hellip;.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Arno fell to his knees on the spot after admitting his defeat.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">After witnessing the result, Alvis turns towards Fritz.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Well, I told you so, didn&rsquo;t I? There is no need to ever question about Benimaru-sama&rsquo;s victory. But your friend did try his best. Then, what do you plan to do now?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Alvis&rsquo; seductive eyes shed a light of curiosity and interest. She asked while observing how Fritz would react.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">In response, Fritz&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c14">I can&rsquo;t believe Arno has lost&hellip;&hellip; This is way worse than I imagined. It still depends on how Hinata-sama and demon lord Rimuru would resolve everything, but I&rsquo;d better make up my mind here. These people are not planning to kill us. But since the fight was started by Reynald, there&rsquo;s no way we could just resume a friendly negotiation. But even so it doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter much if I begin to fight as well&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He observes his surrounding with &ldquo;Magic detection&rdquo; while being wavered in heart. Arno&rsquo;s defeat is just as what he witnessed.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Reynald&rsquo;s side also seems to be concluding as more and more Holy Knights have fallen. A complete defeat.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Bacchus on the other hand is putting up a equal fight against Beastketeer Suphia.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">And Ritase&mdash;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;s been tied up by some unknown things, and her face looks all flastured.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The grey-haired Majin next to her seems to be protecting her protecting Ritase in midst of some battle. The ones combating are, grey-haired Majin and water maiden</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c14">Could that be, &ldquo;Clone Technique&rdquo;? If that&rsquo;s the case, it would make sense why his presence is barely felt</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">What&rsquo;s more to his surprise it&rsquo;s the dominance expressed by the Majin&rsquo;s clone over water maiden. Its blows dealt by the hands of Clone, which should have been constructed using magicule, were effective even against higher spirits that has resistance against physical attack.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Which means its summoner must be even stronger.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">It would seem that Fritz has underestimated the threat of this gray hair Majin purely based on the Magicule of its clone.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">In other words, it&rsquo;s a misjudgement of the Majin&rsquo;s strength from the start, a true mistake on Fritz&rsquo;s part.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c14">Has Ritase also been defeated as well? Uncle Bacchus seems to be barely managing a draw. And who remains is only Hinata-sama&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Her battle with demon lord Rimuru is something beyond Fritz&rsquo;s understanding. Those are speeds unknown to a commoner&mdash;&mdash;Even &ldquo;Magic Detection&rdquo; is meaningless in interpreting the ongoing battle, whose speed has exceeded the processing power of human brain. Fritz&rsquo;s concern would be meaningless regardless.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c14">I seem absolutely outmatched by sheer strength.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He would probably only hinder Hinata rather than giving her a hand.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">If that&rsquo;s the case, there&rsquo;s only one thing Fritz could do.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">He spoke to Alvis who&rsquo;s been awaiting an answer.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Although I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much more use trying to combat, do you mind spending some time with me? I would be ashamed to see my friends again if that&rsquo;s not the case, wouldn&rsquo;t I now?</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Fritz has dignity too.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Even if victory or failure poses no purpose, the battle itself may hold some meaning. So thought Fritz.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;You just have to act like an idiot at places like that, Fritz&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Hinata would probably tease him with such line.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Yeah, yeah&mdash;&mdash;Yeah, Fritz thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But he doesn&rsquo;t dislike that part of himself at all.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">Fufufu, alright then. You are beginning to impress me, Holy Knight Fritz-dono.</span><span class="c2">&#12301;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&#12300;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m most grateful.

Perhaps Hinata-san looks completely different from her counterpart in the web version.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But, this should be the original (canonical) Hinata.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Due to the plot heading in complete different direction, this feeling becomes like this.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">You only have to compare the stories in the two versions to know&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s how I think. But, it may even be more fun for the readers who have not read the web version to read the light novel directly. In that aspect I hope everyone would choose the preferred way of reading it!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">At the prologue, there are people discussing suspicious stuffs, how could we have not yet seen their appearances in the main storyline?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7" id="h.3o7alnk"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s a reason to account for people&rsquo;s doubts regarding this.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s definitely not because the author has forgotten to write about them, so please look forward to it in the next volume!</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But people would probably have a general idea of how the story would develop at this point.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Are this author thinking anything at all?&mdash;&mdash;That&rsquo;s not the case. It&rsquo;s almost as if the author doesn&rsquo;t plan to transfer the web version directly to the light novel.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s indeed the case, so i feel it would be a hard task to even trying to continue the story like the original story.
